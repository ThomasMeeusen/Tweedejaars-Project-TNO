0,"(CNN)  -- Two sheriff's deputies responding to a domestic dispute between a pair of brothers Monday night were shot and badly injured in the same Washington county where four officers were killed last month, authorities said. The Pierce County deputies were wounded while responding to a domestic violence incident at home near the town of Eatonville, south of Seattle, said Hunter George, a county spokesman. They killed the gunman, identified as David E. Crable, in an exchange of fire, authorities said. Sgt. Nick Hausner, 43, a 20-year veteran of the Pierce County Sheriff's Department, was transported to Madigan Army Medical Center where he was in serious condition, the department said. He is married and has children who are 14 and 12 years old. Deputy Kent Mundell, 44, a nine-year veteran, was airlifted to the trauma center at Harborview Medical Center where he was in critical condition with life-threatening injuries, the sheriff's department said. He also is married and has two children, a 16-year-old and a 10-year-old. Pierce County prosecutor Mark Lindquist said Crable had a history of protection orders sought by family members. Earlier this year, Crable pleaded guilty to malicious mischief and brandishing a knife in an incident involving his brother, Lindquist said, and protection orders were imposed afterward, telling him to stay away from his brother and a female minor. Both counts were misdemeanors. Lindquist said Crable had no felony convictions. The protective orders were not in effect during the Monday night shooting, Lindquist said. The prosecutor said other protection orders that emerged were not the result of charges filed. ""They are a result of people saying this guy is a danger to me,"" Lindquist said. ""I think you can reasonably infer from his history, he had an alcohol problem."" Crable went to his brother's house Monday night and there was a domestic dispute, said Sheriff's detective Ed Troyer. One of the men invited the officers inside the house, while the other man went upstairs. He returned with a weapon and shot at the deputies, striking them several times, Troyer said. Local coverage from CNN affiliate KIRO . The deputies returned fire, killing the alleged shooter, he said. ""There were a lot of rounds fired,"" Troyer said. Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire issued a statement saying, ""My thoughts and prayers are with the two wounded Pierce County deputies, their families, friends, and the entire law enforcement community."" This incident comes in the aftermath of two other recent cop shootings in the Seattle area. Since October 31, eight police officers or deputies have been shot. Five have died in the attacks. On Halloween night, Seattle police Officer Timothy Brenton was fatally shot while sitting in his patrol car. Brenton, 39, was reviewing paperwork from a traffic stop when someone fired into his patrol car. An officer Brenton was training was wounded in the shooting. A suspect in that case was arrested and pleaded not guilty. On November 29, four officers from Lakewood, Washington, were killed in an ambush-style shooting at a coffee shop. Police shot and killed the suspect in that attack after a two-day manhunt. Troyer said it was ""surreal"" to be responding to another shooting that involved officers. His department has led the investigation into the shooting of the four Lakewood officers. ""I am deeply troubled by the recent series of attacks on our law enforcement officers,"" Gregoire said in the statement. ""I ask that all Washington citizens join me in sending a clear message that these assaults on law enforcement officers will not be tolerated. ""The people of Washington and across America know that those who wear a badge show us the true meaning of service. They sacrifice their safety for ours. We owe them and their families our gratitude, respect and support.""

1,"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- At least three men died from their wounds Wednesday after they were shot in a confrontation with Ugandan security forces at a destroyed historic site, the Ugandan government said. The men were part of a group of Buganda tribe members who rushed to the site of the Tombs of the Buganda Kings which was destroyed by fire Tuesday night. Exactly how many people were wounded remained unclear despite the government statement. While the government statement listed three dead and five wounded, the Ugandan Red Cross said it had ferried 23 injured people from the site to a Mulago hospital, 11 of them with bullet wounds. ""There several other cases, whose number I can not establish, who were either carried away by their relative or friends after sustaining bullet wounds. Others were stampeded on as they ran,"" said Uganda Red Cross official Susan Kabwe, who was at the tombs site. The tomb site is a UNESCO-listed cultural site of major significance to the country's largest tribe. It was not clear what started the fire at the Tombs of the Buganda Kings, which was built in 1882 and lies near the capital, Kampala. It contained the tombs of four ancient kings of the Buganda people along with cultural relics, including the spears of past kings. Tensions between the Buganda and the government have historically run high, in part because President Yoweri Museveni is not from the tribe. There have been claims Museveni favors his own people, a tribe in the west, and the Buganda have said they feel persecuted. Both the central government and the tribe began separate investigations of the fire Wednesday. ""We saw a huge fire popping out of the tombs as it rained,"" said Jowelia Lunkuse, 49, who operates a kiosk at the edge of the site. ""The flames kept increasing high in the air and we had to close and ran away, fearing it would spread to burn us."" Museveni visited the site Wednesday morning. King Ronald Mutebi arrived moments after Museveni left, along with Medard Ssegona, the Buganda kingdom's information minister. Are you in Uganda? Share your view on the situation . ""We are getting all sorts of testimonies from our people whom we will use in our independent investigations, but we do not rule out acts of foul play from our enemies,"" Ssegona said. A tense atmosphere gripped Kampala hours later, with angry people lining the streets and armed soldiers on patrol. The tombs were on a hilltop around the former Buganda palace, built in 1882 and converted into the royal burial ground in 1884, according to UNESCO. The main building was low and circular, topped by a high conical dome. UNESCO called the building ""a major example of an architectural achievement in organic materials, principally wood, thatch, reed, wattle and daub. The site's main significance lies, however, in its intangible values of belief, spirituality, continuity and identity."" The tombs are where the reigning king, or kabaka, frequently carried out important rituals related to the Ganda culture, the largest ethnic group in the land-locked East African country. The tombs were built in the ""finest traditions"" of local architecture and palace design, UNESCO said. The palace with its tombs ""reflects technical achievements developed over many centuries,"" the organization said. ""It is a major spiritual center for the Buganda and is the most active religious place in the kingdom."" ""The UNESCO World Heritage Centre expresses its dismay for this tragic event that devastated the site and its related symbolic values,"" the group said in a statement. ""UNESCO is ready to mobilize international experts to help the Ugandan authorities in assessing the damage and envisaging remedial actions. ""The Tombs of Buganda Kings at Kasubi were inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2001 and were recognized as a masterpiece of human creativity both in their conception and execution, bearing eloquent witness to the living cultural traditions of the Buganda."" Buganda kings have always built their palaces on strategic hills to control the major roads to the palace and find easy ways to escape in case of an invasion or rebellion. When they died, the traditional practice was to bury each king at a separate site to establish a royal shrine for his jaw bone, which was believed to contain his spirit. These shrines were staffed by descendants of the kings' leading chiefs, his widows, his ritual half-sister, and a medium through which the dead king was said to communicate with his successors. Many of the shrines are still maintained today. Journalist Katherine Haywood and Samson Ntale contributed to this report.","Tombs of the Buganda Kings in Uganda destroyed by fire Tuesday night .

2,"(CNN) -- Actress Angelina Jolie says she feels passionate about Haiti, whose ""extraordinary"" people are inspiring her with their resilience after the devastating earthquake one month ago. During a visit to Haiti this week, she said that despite the terrible tragedy, Haitians are dignified and calm. Jolie, a good will ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said of the Haitians, ""They're very inventive people, they're very strong people, and they're finding ways to help themselves."" ""I think we have a moral duty to do what we can for any country that's suffering,"" she told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview from Port-au-Prince. ""I think we have a very big obligation to the place. ... I'll continue to come back and I'll continue to express what I am learning."" Jolie expressed particular concern about the fate of Haiti's children -- the amputees, the homeless and the orphans -- and worried about the risk of child trafficking. Haiti earthquake: Numbers tell the story . ""Trafficking has been a huge problem for a very long time ... so I think everybody that means well needs to really take that very seriously, and not get frustrated, but really work with the country,"" she said. ""And for myself, as somebody who is an adoptive parent, I understand the urge to assist in that way, but now is not the time. An emergency is not the time for new adoptions anyway."" Pressed on whether she might consider adopting a Haitian child, Jolie told Amanpour, ""I'm always open to children around the world. We're that kind of family. Brad [Pitt] and I talk about that. ""But that's not what we're focusing on at this time, by any means. We're not here for that. We're here to see how we can help protect the children in the country and scale up the needs here."" Jolie said it is vital to reunite families that have been torn apart by the disaster and set up a system to register survivors. ""We don't know who is an orphan. I've met [Haitian] women in the Dominican Republic in hospitals who were saying they haven't spoken to their children,"" she said. ""They have no cell phones, they have no way to tell their children they're alive. They can't find them yet."" She also was worried about children who lost limbs in the earthquake. ""You see little kids that have lost their legs and you ask them if they are all right and they say they're OK, and somehow they are able to smile. ... I think [that] says a lot about them."" Jolie said it's vital for the world to provide sufficient housing for survivors -- housing that is strong enough to stand up to hurricanes. ""We saw a large amount of tents, new tents, but that's not necessarily going to be the answer because they've got this much bigger problem in how to find proper shelter to survive hurricanes,"" she said. Last fall, hundreds of people died in flooding and landslides as two large hurricanes and a tropical storm hit the nation. Jolie said the scale of the disaster is nothing like she's seen before.

3,"(CNN) -- The managing director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Fund is missing after his glider plane crashed into a lake in Morocco, the state news agency of the United Arab Emirates reported Friday. Authorities were searching for Sheikh Ahmed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is a brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the UAE, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Sheikh Ahmed is also chairman of the board of trustees of the Zayed Foundation for Charity and Humanitarian Works, said WAM, the news agency. The plane went down in the northwestern city of Skhirat, according to Morocco's official news agency, MAP. Forbes' 2009 rankings of ""The World's Most Powerful People"" rated the missing sheikh at No. 27. The pilot was rescued in good condition, WAM said. A spokesman for the fund did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The sovereign-wealth fund, which was established in 1976, is owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. In an interview in January with Germany's business daily newspaper Handelsblatt, Sheikh Ahmed said he preferred not to use the sovereign-wealth fund label to describe the investment fund. ""We prefer to be seen simply as a globally diversified investment institution, with the difference being that our owner is the government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi,"" he said. ""ADIA's sole mission, which has not changed in over 30 years, is to secure and maintain the current and future welfare of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi."" Asked about news reports that ADIA's global assets range between $300 billion and $800 billion, Sheikh Ahmed hewed to the secretive style that has marked the fund. ""As a matter of policy, ADIA does not disclose its assets under management,"" he said. But he noted that his brother, the president, who is also ADIA's chairman, ""has stated publicly that some of the highest estimates seen in the media have been exaggerated.""","Search under way for Abu Dhabi executive Sheikh Ahmed after Morocco plane crash .

4,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- The death toll from flooding and mudslides in Brazil continued to climb Thursday, with official reports of at least 181 fatalities. Thousands of people have been left homeless, said the government-run Agencia Brasil news service. The Rio de Janeiro mayor's office placed that figure at 5,000. At least 161 people have been injured, the Rio de Janeiro state government said Thursday on its Web site. A record 11.3 inches (287 millimeters) of rain fell in Rio within 24 hours Tuesday, Mayor Eduardo Paes said, according to the news service. The downpour continued Wednesday. iReport: Share your photos, video, stories with CNN . More than 30 homes were destroyed in a mudslide Wednesday in metropolitan Rio, Agencia Brasil said. About 200 people could be buried or trapped in the mud, emergency officials said. The cities of Niteroi and Sao Goncalo are among the hardest hit, with more than 80 dead and dozens missing, the news service said. CNN affiliate TV Record showed firefighters, military personnel and other rescuers using heavy machinery to dig for buried residents. Brazil's minister of cities, Marcio Fortes, said that housing and sanitation problems are not new for Rio. His department, which works directly with cities on urban development projects, said that before this week's flooding, the government already had set aside some $800 million to cities to help deal with flood waters and poor infrastructure. Now, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has made available another $11 billion for drainage infrastructure across Brazil, Fortes said. As for the project that sits before them, Fortes estimated that about 4,000 homes can be rebuilt, together with better roads, schools and health centers. These would provide a shift from the current structures in the slums of Rio, where housing is often improvised. ""You can't correct the past, but you can fix the future,"" Fortes said.

5,"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Romel Joseph calls it his second life. ""When I came here, I said I was 99.9 percent dead, and I am leaving here 85 percent alive,"" he said. The blind violinist who was trapped for 18 hours after Haiti's earthquake in January was released from a Miami, Florida, hospital over the weekend after what doctors say is an amazing recovery. The powerful January 12 quake leveled his five-story music school in Port-au-Prince, and he was pinned beneath the debris. His friends were able to remove him from the rubble of the New Victorian School, and he was airlifted out of Port-au-Prince by the American Embassy to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. Joseph suffered severe injuries, including a fractured hand and two crushed legs. To get through the painful ordeal, Joseph prayed and let his mind drift to thoughts of every concerto he had ever played. ""I didn't think I would be alive ... I thought my time was up,"" Joseph said.  ""But my time is not up yet, so God will provide and show me how to fulfill my dream."" Joseph plans to return to Haiti at the end of the month to start rebuilding the New Victorian School, where he is the director. He hopes to have a makeshift structure up within two weeks so children can begin attending the dual purpose music and academic school by mid-April. The temporary structure is estimated to cost $35,000. It will take another two to three years to build a permanent school, one that Joseph said will be earthquake-proof. During Joseph's last physical therapy session, the Juilliard-trained violinist played classical numbers and hymns as part of his treatment. To the delight of patients around him, Joseph stuck chord after chord on the violin stretching and strengthening his hand that was badly fractured. ""I couldn't put my fingers on the strings at first and gradually I was able to play little one or two notes and now I can play, not great but it's a blessing,"" Joseph said modestly. Doctors had initially feared that he might never play violin again. The violin wasn't the only instrument helping Joseph repair his shattered hand during the 18 hours of physical therapy he received each week. A keyboard donated by musician Steve Wonder has helped Joseph regain the strength in his fingers. Wonder, who is also blind, had heard Joseph's story on CNN and said he was moved to act. ""What better way to express God's love than to give something that is special to you to someone else who is in need,"" Wonder said.  ""So that's why I did what I did."" Joseph hopes to return playing professionally by October, when he would like to have a debut concert with Wonder. ""I would like to play with him and thank him in person for helping in my recovery.""","Blind violinist Romel Joseph released from hospital .

6,"(CNN) -- At first, Kip Scheidler said he felt the ground tremble. Then the roof began to shake. Tiles tumbled from the ceiling as people bolted from their chairs to escape. When Scheidler tried to follow them, he could barely keep his balance as the ground wobbled. ""The weird thing is that afterward you will swear that it lasted 20 minutes but it really lasted 60 seconds,"" Scheidler said of the earthquake tremors. ""But at the moment, it seems like it will never stop, and it keeps getting stronger."" That's how Scheidler remembers one of the most horrific moments in his life -- the 1986 earthquake in El Salvador that killed 1,500 people. All those memories came flooding back recently when Scheidler turned on CNN and saw images from this week's earthquake in Haiti, which may have killed at least 100,000 people, according to initial estimates. ""I was sickened by the news,"" said Scheidler, now the senior director for global disaster response for Habitat for Humanity International, an international relief agency. ""I was there [El Salvador] as family members identified the bodies of family members pulled from the rubble. It's something that you can never forget. I can't imagine hundreds of thousands of people going through that now."" For people like Scheidler, the news from Haiti isn't abstract. It's personal. They are people who have either survived natural disasters or respond to them. The Haitian earthquake has forced some of them to think again about the survival lessons they learned, and what Haitians face in the days ahead. How disaster brings out best, worst in human nature . Several say disasters can reveal the worst in human nature. Patrick Johns traveled to Indonesia in the immediate aftermath of the 2004 Tsunami. He's also traveled to Ethiopia to aid in famine relief and Rwanda after the country was decimated by genocide. Johns, who is now the director of emergency response for Catholic Relief Services, said it is critical to immediately establish security right in Haiti. ""Crime is a problem in Haiti even in the best of times,"" Johns said. ""With this kind of situation, it's going to go from bad to worse."" Security can make the difference between life and death, Johns said. It's not enough to deliver the right supplies to Haitians. Someone has to guard the good Samaritans. ""You could get stopped on the road, your driver could be thrown in the ditch and you lose everything,"" Johns said. People responding to the disasters often have to make excruciating choices, Johns said. In the past, aid workers would help some needy people but turn down others when they ran out of supplies. How an aid workers makes that decision can cause a riot, Johns said. It's better to talk to people beforehand to warn them that not everyone will get help immediately, but eventually all will be helped, he said. ""If you can only build 30 ramshackle shelters, who are the 30 who get them and what's going to be the reaction of people who don't get help,"" Johns said. ""It can be nightmarish."" See other places hit by historic natural disasters and their recovery . Another disaster lesson: Don't wait for the authorities to help, several disaster experts said. Tad Agoglia is the founder of the the First Response Team. Since May 2007, he and his crew have aided thousands of victims at disaster sites across the United States, free of charge, he said. Agoglia said disaster survivors become energized when they stop waiting for the cavalry and start doing what they can within the first ten hours of the disaster. When people act, they shake off their stupor, he said. ""Things start moving. Roads are opened up. Order comes to chaos and people start to speak to each other,"" Agoglia said. ""People began to have hope. They say, 'It's not going to last like this forever. We can begin again.' '' Impact Your World: How you can help . One of the most important needs for Haitians right now isn't just food, water and medicine but something else: heavy moving equipment, Agoglia said. Agoglia's company has three cranes as well as infrared cameras that can spot body heat under rubble and lighting towers that illuminate the darkness. It might not be as obvious as delivering water, but it's vital, he said. ""Bringing in food and water and those kind of things are great, but there's only so much you can do with human hands,"" Agoglia said. Disasters also require leadership -- not from so far-off entity but from ordinary Haitians in the hardest-hit areas, some said. During disasters, community leaders become critical, said Eddie Argenal, director of humanitarian assistance for CHF International, a relief agency based in Silver Spring, Maryland. Community leaders can quickly take an estimate of the damage done, their community's needs, and start clean-up efforts. They give their communities a head-start, Argenal said. ""Humanitarian assistance can take time to arrive, so the community plays a hugely important role in their own recovery,"" Argenal said. ""The more proactive a community is, the better they will do in the short and long term."" How communities rebuild after disaster . History gives Haitians a reason to hope. Virtually every major city that's been demolished since 1800 has been rebuilt -- no matter how poor the city was or where it was located, said Lawrence J. Vale, co-author of ""The Resilient City: How Modern Cities Recover from Disaster."" Vale said people have such a fierce attachment to where they live that they will go to extraordinary lengths to rebuild their homes. Vale said he remembers seeing pictures of residents in New Orleans mowing their lawns in front of their destroyed homes after Hurricane Katrina struck. He also saw a picture of Japanese schoolchildren in Hiroshima, Japan, holding their lessons outdoors in 1946, a year after an atomic bomb had vaporized their city. ""They're attempting got have some semblance of normalcy in this totally surreal, devastating landscape,"" Vale said. ""It's an extraordinary testament to the effort of people to go on."" Scheidler, the survivor of the El Salvador earthquake, has seen the same resiliency. After the initial quake, there is a surge of adrenalin, he said. People spread out and rush to their homes to check on relatives. People are nervous, trying to put the pieces together. Then they start to rally around one another. Scheidler said he visited a neighborhood in El Salvador that had been buried by a mudslide after the earthquake struck. Nobody waited for the authorities. ""People who had construction equipment starting showing up and afterward everybody was grabbing everything they could, whether it was a shovel or a gardening tool, to help dig through the dirt,"" Scheidler said. Scheidler said the buildings in one community had been flattened, including its church. But the community searched and found the church bell. What they did with the church bell is seared in his memory today just as much as the scenes of tragedy he witnessed, he said. ""They rallied around the church bell, and put it in a tree so they could call everybody together,"" he said. ""What I saw in people in El Salvador was not every man for himself; but everybody pitching in.""","Disaster witnesses reflect on painful lessons learned .
Destruction on vast scale brings out the best and worst in human nature .

7,"London, England (CNN) -- British Airways said its operations got off to a good start Saturday despite a second consecutive strike by thousands of its cabin crew members. The airline said it was able to operate flights as normal at two London airports, Gatwick and City, and that the number of crew members reporting for work at Heathrow -- Britain's busiest airport -- was enough to operate its planned schedule. ""We have got off to a good start,"" the airline said in a statement. The crews walked out at midnight Friday in a strike set to last for four days. They staged a three-day walkout last weekend. BA said enough staff had crossed the picket lines that it was able to fly more than 75 percent of customers scheduled to travel during the strike. Another 18 percent of passengers are booked to fly on other carriers or have changed their travel dates to avoid the strike. Are you worried about the strike? The Unite union, which represents 95 percent of BA's 15,000 cabin crew, said it was too early say how many crew members worked despite the strike. At Heathrow's Terminal 5, which is used primarily by British Airways, things appeared to be running smoothly Saturday and long-haul passengers who spoke to CNN seemed largely unaffected. ""It's been fine from Seattle, (Washington) and I hope it will be fine going back to Seattle,"" passenger Don Dewar said. Ravi Erukulabatn said his mother-in-law was still scheduled to fly to Hyderabad, India. ""She is flying on her own, so we were a bit anxious to begin with, bur fortunately it is happening as expected,"" he told CNN. The airline said it will be able to run a full operation from London's Gatwick and City airports. At Heathrow, BA will be able to run up to 55 percent of its short-haul flights and up to 70 percent of its long-haul flights, the airline said. To help operate as many flights as possible, BA is leasing planes, pilots and crews from six airlines, BA said. It is also using volunteers from other areas of the company to stand in for striking cabin crew. BA handed a statement to passengers on some long-haul flights, reassuring them the airline's own staff was working on board. ""British Airways pilots will be flying your aircraft and you will be cared for in the cabin by British Airways staff,"" the statement read. ""Some of these staff in the cabin may be additional pilots who have volunteered to look after you, and as such will be wearing their pilot uniforms."" Pauline Doyle, a spokeswoman for Unite, said having pilots standing in as flight attendants ""undermines"" the relationship between cabin crew and pilots. BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh had threatened last week to take away the travel perks, which might have been one reason some union staff agreed to work despite the strike last weekend. Striking staff stripped of perks . He said the travel perks are not in the crews' contracts and can be withdrawn at the airline's discretion. The union representing the striking workers called the move ""vindictive"" and said restoring those perks must be part of any deal to end the strike. ""The withdrawal of travel concessions from crew who have been on strike represents unacceptable anti-union bullying,"" Unite joint leaders Derek Simpson and Tony Woodley wrote in a letter to members. ""Any agreement to end this dispute must and will include a framework for the full restoration of those travel concessions."" Other carriers are offering to accommodate BA passengers affected by the strike. British carrier BMI, which flies to Europe and the Middle East, said Friday it had added 4,500 seats to its normal Heathrow flight schedule and Ryanair offered special fares to BA passengers. British Airways and Unite have been at odds for more than a year over changes the airline wants to make to cabin crew pay and work practices. BA says the changes will save the company more than 60 million pounds ($90 million) a year. Unite has said the plans, which call for longer work hours and less staffing, will damage customer service and the BA brand. Stock analysts have said BA has made clear it sees the action not only as a matter of money but who will run the airline -- management or the union. Unite said Friday the two strikes will cost British Airways about £100 million ($149 million), double what BA estimated earlier in the week.","British Airways says it was able to operate flights as normal at two London airports .

8,"Smolensk, Russia (CNN) -- When I found the first piece of fuselage, I was shocked. It was flimsy, the thin metal easily twisted back on itself. Gray on one side, some yellow on the other, it sat in a small puddle of mud a few feet from the road. I was half a mile from the runway, the tall silver birch trees nearby broken like so many matchsticks. Somehow I thought planes were supposed to be stronger than this, but what I was confronted with was an object lesson on the precarious nature of flying. The evidence of what had happened was clear. The plane struck the trees, at first just grazing their uppermost branches and then their slender boughs and trunks. It was enough to rip the plane apart. What feels almost invincible as it powers through takeoff and thrusts upward through the skies at hundreds of miles an hour had been reduced to shreds of metal, little more than a discarded tin can. These are the thoughts that flashed through my mind in those first moments of discovery. And that's when the horror of it sinks in. The last tragic moments for all aboard; it's impossible to imagine the awfulness of those final seconds. I am swept by another emotion, sadness for the families, and I feel captured by an undefined grief. I knew no one aboard, but to see how their lives ended is to know a tiny fraction of the pain their loved ones must bear. But I have come to work, to tell the story of what happened, to piece together the small bits of information we'll get, to make some sense of our corner of this huge tragedy. So that is what my team and I do. Tommy Evans, my producer, and Luis Grahame-Yool, our cameraman, get to work and set up the first live shot. It's cold in Smolensk -- there are still piles of snow here and there. None of us have had much sleep. Luis arrived 12 hours ahead of us, Tommy and I flew in from Macedonia. All of us took the 400-kilometer drive from Moscow to get here. Each of us intent on our job, each of us grappling with the enormity of the day. No day is ever normal at CNN, but this defies even that logic. A president, his wife, many of the country's top military, political and religious leaders killed in a country that's not their own. The implications could be huge. As the day wore on and more details emerged, it seemed clear Russia wanted to make it known it was not at fault. Evidence pointed toward the pilots rather than a mechanical error. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who is leading Russia's investigation, was on course to lay blame at Poland's door. He has a reputation as a tough autocrat, and it seemed to me that's what we are seeing here. But we got to see another face of Putin, too: The stony-faced solemn friend of Poland. There seemed little doubting his grief and seriousness as he stood at the foot of the Polish president's casket during the long sombre repatriation ceremony we witnessed that afternoon. Having stood among the wreckage and broken trees as he has, it is not hard to imagine that this iron man of Russian politics was moved by what he saw. For who among us, however familiar with tragedy, could fail to be touched by the scale and nature of Poland's loss.","CNN's Nic Robertson writes from scene of air crash in Russia .

9,"Naoma, West Virginia (CNN) -- West Virginia's governor on Tuesday named a former head of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration to lead a state investigation into last week's coal mine explosion that left 29 miners dead. Davitt McAteer has overseen investigations into two previous mine accidents, the Sago disaster that killed 12 miners in 2006 and the fire at the Aracoma Alma No. 2 mine that left two workers dead. The West Virginia native served as the Clinton administration's assistant labor secretary for mine safety in the 1990s and is vice president of Wheeling Jesuit University. ""Davitt has the experience and knowledge to lead what will be a complex and extensive investigation into this horrible accident,"" Gov. Joe Manchin said in announcing McAteer's appointment. ""We made tremendous progress in 2006 immediately following the Sago and Aracoma accidents, and I fully expect that we will learn even more from this and make dramatic changes to protect our miners."" The last bodies were recovered early Tuesday from the Upper Big Branch mine, the scene of the fatal explosion April 5. McAteer was critical of the mine's owner, Virginia-based Massey Energy, in the days after the blast. ""Some companies, and this appears to be one, take the approach that these violations are simply a cost of doing business -- it's cheaper for us to mine in an unsafe way or in a way that risks people's lives than it is for us to comply with the statutes, comply with the laws,"" McAteer said last week. There was no immediate response from Massey Energy to McAteer's appointment, but Massey CEO Don Blankenship said last week that its safety history is among the best in the industry. The Montcoal, West Virginia, mine received 458 citations from federal inspectors in 2009, and more than 50 of those were for problems that the operators knew about but had not corrected, according to federal mine safety records. Inspectors cited the operators more than 100 times in the first quarter of 2010, including six times for ""unwarrantable failure"" to correct violations. Massey subsidiary Aracoma Coal pleaded guilty to 10 criminal charges and paid a record $4.2 million in fines and civil penalties in connection with the January 2006 fire that McAteer investigated. Manchin said the state owes an explanation for last week's disaster to the families of the men who died in the Upper Big Branch mine, ""And we owe it to them and every coal miner working today to do everything humanly possible to prevent this from happening again."" Managers of two pension funds have called on Massey's board to oust Blankenship, who has been critical of mining regulations in the past. ""Massey's cavalier attitude toward risk and callous disregard for the safety of its employees has exacted a horrible cost on dozens of hard-working miners and their loved ones,"" New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a written statement Monday. He said Blankenship ""must step down and make room for more responsible leadership at Massey."" New York's state pension fund, which DiNapoli manages, has about $14 million worth of Massey stock -- a tiny fraction of the company's estimated $4.3 billion market capitalization. But his call was echoed by the CtW Investment Group, which manages pension funds for about 6 million union workers. CtW blamed Blankenship's ""confrontational approach to regulatory compliance"" and the failure of the company's board of directors to challenge him for the disaster. ""Under Chairman and CEO Blankenship's domineering leadership, Massey Energy placed short-term production and profit goals ahead of prudent risk management, with devastating consequences for the corporation, its shareholders and employees,"" the fund wrote in a letter to the board. ""In light of these consequences, the urgent need for new leadership is apparent."" The company has not commented on calls for Blankeship's ouster, but said safety ""has been and will continue to be our top priority every day."" ""We do not condone any violation of Mine Safety and Health Administration regulations, and we strive to be in compliance with all regulations at all times,"" it said in a written statement last week. Bodies of the remaining victims were removed overnight, said Jama Jarrett, spokeswoman for the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training. The bodies of seven victims had been recovered shortly after the explosion, and 13 bodies were removed Sunday. Until Sunday, U.S. flags on all federal buildings in the state will be kept at half-staff per a proclamation that President Obama signed on Monday. The mining disaster was the worst in the United States since 1972, when 91 miners died in a fire at the Sunshine Mine in Kellogg, Idaho.

10,"(CNN)  -- A Navy training jet crashed in a north Georgia forest on Monday, killing at least three people aboard and setting more than 10 acres of woodland ablaze, local and federal authorities said. A fourth person aboard the jet was unaccounted for Monday night, said Harry White, spokesman for the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida. The cause of the crash was under investigation. FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said the crash of the twin-engine T-39N trainer caused no injuries on the ground. It went down just north of Morganton, Georgia, about 80 miles north of Atlanta, Fannin County Sheriff's Maj. Keith Bosen said. ""We got reports that it was flying pretty low,"" Bosen said. The plane had flown north-northeast over the nearby town of Blue Ridge before it went down about 4:40 p.m., he said. The mountainous area is ringed by national forest land, and the crash set the surrounding woods on fire. ""We have about a 10- to 15-acre fire still working at this time,"" Bosen said. The T-39N took off from Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida, about 400 miles south of Morganton, Bergen said. The jet is a military version of Rockwell's twin-engine Saberliner executive aircraft.

11,"Washington (CNN) -- Another massive snowstorm barreled into the mid-Atlantic region Tuesday, as residents still reeling from a paralyzing weekend blizzard faced more of the same. Hundreds of flights were canceled, and airlines were waiting to see whether they would have to cancel more. No flights were expected to be operating Wednesday at Reagan National Airport or at Washington Dulles International, the Washington Airports Authority said. Federal workers and schoolchildren in the nation's capital were told to stay home for a second consecutive day. The National Weather Service predicted another 10 to 20 inches of snow for northern Virginia, eastern Maryland and Washington beginning Tuesday afternoon and continuing through Wednesday. In last weekend's blizzard, a record 32.4 inches of snow fell on Washington's Dulles International Airport over two days, breaking the January 7-8, 1996, record of 23.2 inches. Are you there? Share your winter weather photos, video . If as severe as predicted, the new storm will be the third major snowfall to hit the nation's capital and surrounding region in slightly more than seven weeks. In Washington on Tuesday, out-of-towners Susan Martin and Robert Travers told CNN affiliate WJLA they had just flown to the city for a conference, but learned when they arrived that the conference had been canceled. Flights that would take them home from Reagan National Airport had been canceled, too. ""We probably won't get a flight back out of here until Thursday. That's what they're telling us,"" Martin told WJLA. WJLA.com: People stranded at Washington airports, train stations . It was not expected to begin snowing in some areas until Tuesday night or Wednesday. Forecasters said Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, could be slammed with 3 to 7 inches Tuesday and an additional 8 to 12 inches on Wednesday; Washington, 4 to 8 inches on Tuesday night and another 3 to 7 inches Wednesday; 5 to 8 inches Tuesday and 3 to 5 on Wednesday in Boston, Massachusetts; and 2 to 4 inches Tuesday and 6 to 10 inches Wednesday in New York. Snow coverage from CNN affiliate WBAL . Delays of 30 minutes were reported for some flights at Chicago, Illinois', O'Hare International Airport, where more than 600 flights were canceled. Most of the flights at Midway Airport also were canceled, according to Gregg Cunningham, spokesman for the Chicago Department of Aviation. Southwest Airlines was expecting to resume its normal schedule Wednesday at 10:30 a.m., he said. Travelers should confirm the status of their flights by checking their airline's Web site before departing for the airport, he advised. Delta Air Lines canceled 375 flights, including regional flights, in various locations Tuesday, spokesman Anthony Black said. He said a decision would be made Tuesday evening on any Wednesday cancellations. American Airlines canceled 80 flights into and out of Washington and Philadelphia, spokesman Tim Wagner said. American and Delta said they had pre-emptively canceled 120 flights for Wednesday for both cities. US Airways canceled 135 mainline flights and 307 US Airways Express flights systemwide, spokesman Andrew Christie said. He said the airline has canceled 380 mainline flights and 1,042 US Airways Express flights. Snow causes more headaches for travelers . The storms were taking a financial toll on local governments. Alexandria, Virginia, spent more than $1 million for the massive snowstorm that hit the region in December, budget analyst Morgan Routt said, and the city was still cleaning up after last weekend's storm. ""So, you can imagine, that's costing even more,"" he said. ""We've had people working around the clock."" The city, whose fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30, generally budgets $790,000 annually for snow removal. That covers the costs of equipment, personnel, contractors, materials and supplies. For the 2009 year ending in July, Routt said, the city spent only $485,000. Part of this year's costs are reimbursable by the federal government because the governor declared a snow emergency, he added. All Washington National Guard full-time personnel were asked to report for duty Tuesday morning and expect to stay for two or three nights, helping with emergency response operations. Elsewhere, crews worked 24-hour shifts to clear roads and repair power lines, warning that it might take days to restore electricity to some customers from Pennsylvania to Virginia. In Mount Penn, Pennsylvania, about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, many people were using the space between last week's storm and the approaching one to fix snowblowers, CNN affiliate WFMZ reported. Dave Swope, who has worked at Leinbach's Hardware in Mount Penn for 25 years, said Tuesday he has never seen so many people wanting to fix their snowblowers at the same time. ""We got people yesterday asking us how to start them, how to turn them on,"" Swope told WFMZ. ""They just haven't used them in years, and then the knowledge goes away.""

12,"Carnes, Mississippi (CNN)  -- The deaths of two Mississippi teens are about to put a national focus on a little-recognized problem. Devon Byrd, 16, and Wade White, 18, were killed when a natural gas tank at a well production site exploded last fall in Carnes, in southern Mississippi. Local teenagers said the site is a popular hangout because it's quiet and secluded. But the dead teens' parents say the explosion could have been prevented if some warning signs had been posted -- ""something simple as fences, gates and signs, probably very inexpensive, and certainly a lot less expensive that what a child's life is worth,"" said White's father, Phillip. Police say they don't know exactly what ignited flammable vapors inside the tank. When it exploded, the teenagers were killed instantly. Their bodies were found about 40 yards from the tank's base; the tank landed another 20 yards from them. Investigators say they found a lighter, but don't know whether it was involved. ""I couldn't believe that my child was gone,"" White's mother, Wanda, told CNN. The White and Byrd families have an ally in their camp. The Chemical Safety Board, created by Congress, investigated the accident and found at least 40 other deaths involving oil and gas wells in the past 25 years. Most of them involved young people. The CSB says it found a patchwork of laws nationwide that don't uniformly address security around oil and gas wells. It's asking the industry to police itself by voluntarily installing fences and warning signs. ""If these tanks are sitting out there in the middle of nowhere, no protection around them, no warning, they are just an accident waiting to happen,"" CSB Chairman John Bresland told CNN. Delphi Oil, the company that owns the tank that blew up, told CNN it could not discuss the accident because of pending negligence lawsuits filed by the families. A spokesman called the boys' deaths tragic, but the company says it is complying with all rules. However, authorities tell CNN there are no state regulations requiring locked gates or no-smoking signs. ""He may be in compliance,"" Forrest County Sheriff Billy McGee told CNN. ""But there's nothing in the rules for him to be in compliance with."" Carnes is about 40 miles north of the Gulf Coast. In nearby Laurel, city zoning laws require oil and gas tanks to be fenced in with warning signs, according to Emergency Management District Executive Director Terry Steed. The CSB asked family and friends of Byrd and White to help them make an educational video about the dangers of oil and gas production sites. It's called ""No Place to Hang Out,"" and it's part of a national campaign starting this week to teach young people about the potential danger of tanks. But it also urges the industry to improve itself. ""There's nothing we can do to bring Devon and Wade back, "" said White's girlfriend, Maria Thompson, 16. ""But if it can save someone else's life, I'd like to see it happen."" ""Like McDonalds,"" added another friend, Shawn Ashlee Davis. ""They have to put 'Caution. This coffee's hot' (on their cups). I really think they need signs warning 'This is a dangerous place.' "" Mississippi state Sen. Billy Hudson told CNN he plans to introduce a state law requiring barbed-wire-topped fences, locked gates and ""Danger - Keep Out"" signs. ""There's no guarantees,"" Hudson said. ""You could cut the fence with a bolt cutter, or you can shoot off a lock. But it'll be a deterrent, and it's a step in the right direction."" White's father says his son would be proud that friends and family are speaking out: ""He'd be proud that we're trying to do something to keep other kids and other families from going through what we're going through.""","Two Mississippi teens killed when natural gas tank at well production site exploded .

13,"(CNN)  -- A car bomb exploded outside a British army base in Northern Ireland early Monday, injuring one person. The blast went off about 12:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. Sunday ET) outside the Palace Barracks in the Belfast neighborhood of Holywood where Britain's MI5 intelligence service has its regional headquarters. The incident occurred just 30 minutes after police powers were transferred from London to Belfast. According to a statement from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the bomb was placed in a stolen taxi which had been hijacked late Sunday in North Belfast. The taxi driver was held by three males for almost two hours before being told to drive his silver Skoda to the base. Police added that security staff at the facility were made aware of the abandoned vehicle just before midnight and commenced evacuation procedures. One elderly male, who was walking past the barracks at the time of the explosion, sustained minor injuries after the bomb detonated. There was no immediate report of a claim of responsibility for the blast, though the BBC reported that the Real IRA, a republican splinter group, admitted being behind the attack. ""Clearly the people responsible for this showed absolutely no regard for human life,"" said local police commander, Chief Superintendent Nigel Grimshaw. ""There is no question in my mind, this was designed for one thing and one thing only -- to kill or cause serious injury to people and that's exactly what it would have done were it not for the actions of my officers and military colleagues in the Barracks and the community themselves working together. ""Thankfully we were able to evacuate people from the immediate area of the explosion. ""The people responsible for this cowardly attack refuse to accept that Northern Ireland is moving on and that peace is working here. They are callous criminals who simply want to drag everyone back to the past to suit their misguided objectives."" Recent attacks in Northern Ireland have been blamed on dissident Irish republicans who reject the 1998 Good Friday accords, which sharply reduced violence in the British-ruled province. Northern Ireland was wracked for decades by violence between pro-British unionists and republicans who wanted Northern Ireland to join the rest of Ireland. About 3,000 people died in the ""Troubles,"" as the violence was known, before the tenuous peace agreement was hammered out. There has been sporadic violence since then. A booby-trapped car exploded on January 8, severely injuring Constable Peadar Heffron. A car bomb partly exploded outside the headquarters of the Policing Board of Northern Ireland on November 21, and another under-car booby trap exploded on October 22 in east Belfast, injuring a woman, the PSNI said.","Bomb goes off in Belfast neighborhood .

14,"London, England (CNN) -- The death of a British soldier on an explosives-clearing operation in Afghanistan has pushed the British death toll there past that of the 1982 Falklands War, the Ministry of Defence announced Tuesday. The soldier's death brings to 256 the number of British troops killed in Afghanistan since operations there began in 2001, the defense ministry said. The British death toll from the Falklands conflict was 255. The soldier, from the 36 Engineer Regiment, died Monday from an explosion in the Nad-e-Ali district of Afghanistan's southern Helmand Province. He was part of a task force to clear roadside bombs. ""He was leading a team conducting route-clearance operations at the time, making the way ahead safe for others to follow,"" said Lieutenant Colonel David Wakefield, a spokesman for Task Force Helmand. ""His indomitable courage and fortitude, the hallmark of his profession, will not be forgotten."" The Ministry of Defence did not release his name, but said his next of kin had been informed. Two soldiers from The Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, were killed by an explosion Monday, also in Helmand Province, the defense ministry said. The deaths of those soldiers, whose names were not released, meant the total death toll matched that of the Falklands. ""Sad milestones such as this naturally attract attention in the UK, but in theater our people continue resolutely and courageously with the task of assisting Afghans to build their own future,"" said Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, chief of the British Defense Staff. ""We should not forget that each and every death of a member of our armed forces is a tragedy of equal proportion,"" British Defense Secretary Bob Ainsworth said. ""Our thoughts at this time lie firmly with the families and friends of all the brave men and women fallen in Afghanistan, and we should all remember that every one of them has given their lives in defense of their -- and our -- country."" The Falkland Islands are a British territory located 670 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the coast of Argentina. Argentina has claimed sovereignty over the islands since they were occupied by the British in 1833. Argentine troops invaded the islands in April 1982, sparking a two-month war with intense land and sea battles. Argentina surrendered June 14, having lost nearly 650 troops.","Latest casualty brings to 256 number of UK troops killed in Afghanistan .

15,"(CNN) -- Michelle Timberlake didn't expect to venture into the weekend blizzard that blanketed much of the mid-Atlantic. But the interior designer who normally wears high heels to work found herself running through hip-high snow Saturday morning when about 40 cows escaped from the pasture on her and her husband's Boyce, Virginia, farm in search of food and shelter. ""This was not what I imagined for myself,"" she said Sunday, laughing at the memory. Luckily, the cows were corralled -- thanks to a bale of hay -- and the snow stopped, but not before more than 30 inches had been dumped over two days in parts of the region. Timberlake said she and her neighbors were gearing up for the next weather system, expected to hit the area as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service is forecasting more than 5 inches of snow and winds up to 25 mph in the Washington and Baltimore, Maryland, areas. ""Everybody's just trying to clean up and get a little bit ahead of the game before the next round comes,"" said Timberlake, whose farm is located about two hours west of Washington. More than 300,000 people from Pennsylvania to Virginia were without electricity Sunday, utility companies said. In many cases, heavy snow brought down power lines. ""I'm not sure how many people will have their power back on by Super Bowl time, but things are going really well today,"" said Joe Gilbert with a Dominion Power crew working Sunday afternoon to restore power to about 3,000 in one McLean, Virginia, neighborhood. ""It's good weather and we're making good progress so hopefully everybody's power will be back on."" Timberlake said homes around the corner from her farm are without power and have been told it won't be back on until Friday. ""Since the heavy, wet snow is still bringing trees down, we are still seeing new outages occur,"" Allegheny Power said in a statement Sunday. ""Damage assessment is ongoing, but overall estimated times for the restoration of service have not been determined."" The utility company provides electricity to customers in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and Virginia. Nearly 135,000 of its customers had no power, the majority of them, or 92,295, reside in Pennsylvania, the company said. Outages were also reported in Delaware and New Jersey. Residents, businesses and airports were trying to dig out Sunday. Good Samaritans in McLean, Virginia, stopped to help drivers stuck in snow drifts. ""So much for going to the Kennedy Center today,"" said one woman behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz as about five men shoveled and pushed her car out of deep snow. ""We're going home."" CNN iReporter Sean Conrad described his town of Rockville, Maryland, Saturday as empty and photos showed streets recognizable only by traffic lights. The city got 25.5 inches. Conrad told CNN that many roads still were covered by snow Sunday, even though snow plows were working 24 hours a day to clear them. Only a few businesses opened Sunday, and those that did operated with skeleton crews, Conrad said. Federal offices in Washington will be closed Monday, though emergency employees still are expected to work, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management said Sunday. Air traffic in Washington picked up slowly Sunday after a day of cancellations. A record 32.4 inches of snow fell on Dulles International Airport over two days, breaking a January 7-8, 1996, record of 23.2 inches. The quick-falling flakes forced Dulles and the other two main Washington-Baltimore area airports to cancel all flights Saturday. Dulles reopened Sunday to limited service, according to Rob Yingling, spokesman for Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. Airport personnel were still removing snow from the Baltimore-Washington International Airport on Sunday, and it remained uncertain when flights would resume, spokesman Jonathan Dean told CNN. Reagan National Airport was still closed early Sunday afternoon as crews continued to plow snow and chip away at 5 inches of ice that developed overnight, Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority spokeswoman Tara Hamilton said. The airport accommodates just under 700 flights a day, she said. Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania racked up 28.5 inches of snow, the National Weather Service. The airport was closed Saturday, but it reopened Sunday and was expected to operate at 60 percent capacity, spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said. Amtrak canceled several trains Sunday after trees and power lines fell onto portions of its tracks, the transit company said. Dozens of Greyhound routes in the Mid-Atlantic states also were canceled, the bus company said on its Web site. And state officials have advised drivers to stay off the roads. CNN's Sarah Aarthun, Justin Lear, Sarah Lee and Rachel Rodriguez contributed to this report.","NEW: Federal offices in Washington will be closed Monday .

16,"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- Polish legislators were planning Wednesday to hold a June election to choose a successor to President Lech Kaczynski, whose death in an air crash is generating unprecedented scenes of public grief. Mourners lined up through the night outside Warsaw's Presidential Palace to pay respects to Kaczynski, whose body is lying in state alongside that of his wife. However, amid national unity in the wake of the disaster, there were the first signs of discord with protests reported over a decision to bury the late president and his wife in a crypt previously reserved for monarchs and saints. The couple were among 96 Polish dignitaries, military top brass and officials who died when the plane carrying them to a service commemorating Polish prisoners of war massacred in Russia during World War II crashed in bad weather. Their bodies were repatriated earlier this week. Caskets carrying 30 more crash victims were returned to Poland on Wednesday aboard a military jet from Moscow. Draped in Polish flags the caskets were lined up side-by-side by an honor guard during a solemn ceremony at Warsaw's airport. iReport: Share your photos, video and stories with CNN . The disaster has caused shockwaves through Poland, with thousands of people waiting up to eight hours to pay their respects to the first couple. Due to overwhelming demand, the palace was opened to the public through the night. A line of up to 15,000 mourners, many dressed in black and carrying pictures of the deceased first couple, could be seen snaking through the center of Warsaw Wednesday. Images of Poland's collective grief . ""I think this is really unique to Poland,"" U.S. ambassador to Poland, Lee Feinstein told CNN, adding that the devastation to the country's leadership was unparalleled in the contemporary world. Feinstein described Poland as one of the United States' ""staunchest"" allies, largely thanks to military support for U.S.-led operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to be among international figures attending the first couple's funeral service in Warsaw, scheduled for Saturday. The Kremlin in Moscow said Russian President Dmitry Medvedev would also attend. The service will be followed by the couple's burial on Sunday in Krakow's Wawel Castle. The archbishop of Krakow said burying the late president in the historic crypt was the country's way of honoring him. ""I think in this way the Polish nation wants to include him among the greatest and most revered men in Polish history,"" Stanislaw Dziwisz said on Polish state television. There have been reports of protests in Krakow over the decision, while debate has raged online as to whether Kaczynski, seen as unpopular prior to his death, should be buried in a national heroes' cemetery in Warsaw rather than at Wawel. Biography: Lech Kaczynski . A Facebook group opposed to the castle burial had garnered 32,000 followers by late Wednesday. According to Poland's PAP news agency, a date for the election that will choose Kaczynski's successor will be announced on April 21 by acting President Bronislaw Komorowski. The agency said the date was likely to be June 13 or 20. Under Poland's constitution Komorowski must call the election within 14 days of the president's death with the vote taking place within 60 days.

17,"New York (CNN) -- Former President Bill Clinton left the hospital Friday morning after doctors performed a procedure to restore blood flow in one of his coronary arteries, longtime friend Terry McAuliffe told CNN. Clinton, 63, was hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian Hospital's Columbia campus after experiencing brief periods of discomfort in his chest over several days, according to Dr. Allan Schwartz, the hospital's chief of cardiology. Two stents were used to restore blood flow to a coronary artery Thursday after images revealed that a bypass graft -- part of a quadruple bypass surgery that Clinton underwent in 2004 -- was blocked, Schwartz said. An electrocardiogram and a blood test showed no evidence of a heart attack, Schwartz said. ""If I know Bill Clinton, he's going to get right back on the phone,"" McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN on Friday. ""Yesterday as they were wheeling him into the operating room, they literally had to take the phone out of his hand as they were wheeling him in to surgery. ""He was on a conference call dealing with Haiti. And I guarantee you as soon as he gets back today he'll be back on the phone."" Schwartz said the need for the procedure had nothing to do with Clinton's post-bypass diet or exercise, which Schwartz called excellent. Rather, Schwartz said, this is ""part of the natural history"" of the bypass treatment. ""He really toed the line in terms of diet and exercise. He really followed the program,"" Schwartz said, adding he told Clinton that he'd be allowed to return to work Monday. The stents have opened the artery that the blocked bypass graft was supposed to service, Schwartz said. Stents are tiny balloons that are threaded into a patient's heart vessels where they are inflated, pushing plaque against the vessel wall and increasing blood flow. The graft's blockage isn't unheard of, because that particular type of graft has a 10 percent to 20 percent failure rate after six years, Schwartz said. However, a bypass graft at a different artery -- the main artery in the front of Clinton's heart -- still looks ""pristine,"" Schwartz said. ""We know from multiple studies that if that bypass is open at this point ... it will remain open,"" he said. Stents and chest pain explained . Schwartz said Clinton was up and walking about two hours after Thursday's procedure. In a written statement, Douglas Band, counselor to the former president, said: ""President Clinton is in good spirits and will continue to focus on the work of his foundation and Haiti's relief and long-term recovery efforts."" Clinton's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, and wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were with him at the hospital Thursday night, Schwartz said. Hillary Clinton was scheduled to leave Friday on a planned trip to the Middle East, but her departure has been delayed until Saturday, a senior U.S. official said. Bill Clinton hasn't left the public eye since he departed the White House in 2001, maintaining an active schedule devoted to global philanthropic interests and speeches. Since the January 12 earthquake that hit Haiti, he has traveled there twice in his latest role as the U.N. special envoy. On February 3, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon placed Clinton in charge of overseeing aid and reconstruction efforts there. Clinton also attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January. David Gergen, CNN senior political analyst, said Clinton was ""exhausted"" and had a cold after returning from his second trip to Haiti earlier this month. Clinton had busy schedule before heart procedure . Clinton's 2004 surgery was performed at the same hospital where he was admitted Thursday. Doctors in 2005 operated again on Clinton to remove scar tissue and fluid that had built up after his bypass surgery. Dr. Spencer King, president of St. Joseph's Heart and Vascular Institute in Atlanta, Georgia, rejected as outdated suggestions that Clinton needs to slow down. ""This is kind of a '50s concept,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview Thursday. ""Now, we've got a lot of fantastic ways to prevent progression of heart disease -- medications, things that can be done. The outlook for people is totally different."" ""If he slows down, he slows down,"" said King, who who has not treated Clinton. But, he added, ""It would be very hard to show any data that would tell you he'll have more trouble if he hangs it up."" King said Thursday's stenting procedure may not be the end of Clinton's heart woes. ""The problem there is that that vein graft is developing disease and sometimes it goes on and develops more,"" he said. ""There's a substantial chance over the next three, four, five years that it could close up again."" CNN's John King, Ed Henry, Jessica Yellin, Elise Labott and Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.","NEW: Clinton leaves hospital Friday morning, former DNC chairman says .

18,"(CNN) -- Heavy snow pummeled much of the East Coast on Wednesday, battering states for the second time in a week and forcing many people to stay home from school and jobs. Several cities had record snowfalls. The storm canceled or delayed flights in several cities, kept federal workers home for a third straight day in Washington, and taxed local government budgets as cities and counties scrambled to pay for snow removal, overtime, salt, supplies and equipment. In Washington, the snow was falling at a rate of 2 inches per hour at one point in the afternoon, CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said. Forecasters predicted that Washington winds would gust to 50 mph overnight. A blizzard warning was to be in effect in the Washington area until 7 p.m., the National Weather Service said. Blowing snow caused such poor visibility at midday that snowplows temporarily parked by the side of the road, authorities said. Forecasters predicted that the storm would dump a total of 8 to 10 inches inside the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495), with higher amounts to the north. Watch the forecast on the storm's trek . ""Even if you're in a SUV, it's difficult to get around,"" Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier said. ""You can't see the Capitol dome through the snow,"" even standing a few yards away. Share your winter weather photos, videos . Government buildings were eerily quiet. The Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service buildings were shut. No one answered the door at the Justice Department, though the attorney general's office said work was still being done at key counterterrorism offices. The U.S. Postal Service said it was experiencing delays in processing mail. Subway service was expected to be limited Thursday to underground stations, and bus service was expected to be suspended on Thursday. Federal agencies were to be closed Thursday, too, and non-emergency employees were to be granted the day off. This winter already has become the snowiest on record for Washington and its suburbs, as well as Baltimore, Maryland, and Wilmington, Delaware, the National Weather Service said. It's also on pace to become the snowiest season on record in other cities, including Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Blizzard warnings also were in effect Wednesday for Asheville, North Carolina; Newark and Atlantic City, New Jersey; Baltimore, Maryland; Dover, Delaware; New York and nearby Long Island; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Under a blizzard warning, the following conditions are expected to be seen for three hours or longer: wind speeds of 35 mph or more and considerable falling and/or blowing of snow with visibility near zero (less than one-fourth mile), the weather service said. In Atlantic City, the landmark Boardwalk -- lined with shops, restaurants and casinos -- remained open despite the snow. New York was to be under a blizzard warning until 6 a.m. Thursday, but the snow was expected to stop falling late Wednesday night. Forecasters predicted wind gusts up to 50 mph and predicted the city will have received 12 to 20 inches of snow by the time the storm ends. In Pennsylvania, all of Interstates 76, 78, 83, 176, 476 and 676, as well as state road 581, were closed Wednesday because of blizzard conditions, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said on its Web site. Part of I-81 was closed, it said. Interstate 80 near Clearfield, Pennsylvania, was shut after two pileups -- one involving 17 cars and the other involving seven cars, said Rich Kirkpatrick from the state's Department of Transportation. One person died and another person was seriously injured, police said. Philadelphia was under a blizzard warning until midnight, and could have as much as 20 inches of snow by the time it stops, forecasters said. In Boston, Massachusetts, snowfall rates of 2 to 3 inches an hour were expected along the Interstate 95 corridor into the evening. A winter storm warning was in effect until 1 a.m. Thursday, with final snow totals of 5 to 10 inches, the weather service said. Thousands of flights were delayed or canceled to and from airports in Baltimore, Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, airlines reported. East Coast storm grounds thousands of flights . ""We're working, and we're plowing as best we can, and then once the winds diminish some, we'll be able to start hauling snow off the airfield as we've been doing for six days now,"" said Tara Hamilton, spokeswoman for Washington Dulles International and Reagan Washington National airports, both of which closed Wednesday. The airports did not plan to reopen until about 7 a.m. Thursday. New York area airports were operational Wednesday afternoon, but airlines canceled most flights in and out of LaGuardia, Newark Liberty International and John F. Kennedy International airports. Rajesh Moorjani, one of the stranded travelers at the Newark, New Jersey, airport, had flown from India on Tuesday night, intending to get a connecting flight to California. On Wednesday, he was getting used to the idea of being stuck on the East Coast for a day, CNN affiliate WABC reported. ""I'm just kind of trying to get in touch with old classmates, ex-colleagues ... trying to put a message on Facebook saying: 'If anybody is in New York, let's get in touch,' "" he told WABC. WABC: Storm socks New Jersey . Amtrak was still providing limited service for Boston, New York and Washington. But most passenger rail service south of Washington was canceled. ""The massive storm has resulted in downed trees and power lines on portions of CSX freight railroad tracks south of Washington resulting in continued service cancellations in Virginia, and the Carolinas,"" the rail line's Web site said. Bus travelers fared no better. ""Pretty much everything out of Virginia, New York, D.C., etc. at this time has been canceled,"" said Maureen Richmond, director of media relations for Greyhound, which transports 22 million passengers per year. ""We're operating where we can, based on weather and road conditions,"" she said. She urged would-be passengers to call the company's ticketing line. Due to improved weather conditions in the Chicago, Illinois, area, airlines were reporting no delays at O'Hare and Midway International Airports. Many businesses in Greenwich, Connecticut, about 30 miles northeast of New York City, closed early Wednesday, in part to allow workers to travel home before the worst of the storm hit. Diane Garett planned to keep her bookstore open, but she gave her employees the day off, WABC reported. ""I just felt it was just safer if they stayed home,"" she told WABC. ""Plus a lot of their children are home from school. So I didn't think it was right to ask them to come to work."" Hardware store owner Troy Usnik was taking somewhat of a breather Wednesday in snowy Philadelphia. The owner of 10th Street Hardware said he sold well over 100 shovels and 200 to 300 bags of salt Tuesday. ""Today seems kind of quiet, but there was a mad rush yesterday. Sales were brisk. Last night was a panic and everyone who didn't have it came out to buy shovels and salt."" Early Wednesday, the snow turned to sleet in Philadelphia, but roads were passable and buses were driving along emergency routes, Usnik said. The National Weather Service predicted 9 to 13 more inches of snow. New York deployed 1,600 salt spreaders to care for 65 miles of roads, CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said. The winter of 2009-2010 has become the snowiest on record for: . • Baltimore, which has received at least 72.3 inches of snow this winter . •  Washington, where Dulles airport has received 72 inches of snow this winter and Reagan National airport has received 54.9 inches . •  Wilmington, Delaware, which has received at least 59.5 inches of snow this winter, breaking its previous record of 55.9 inches.

19,"(CNN) -- Much of the United States was braced for severe winter weather on Monday, as a major storm hit California while an unrelated first round of wintry conditions snarled commutes in the Midwest. The storm hitting California Monday afternoon was expected to affect weather across the country through Wednesday. The wintry weather, caused by a weak disturbance over the Midwest, caused the deaths of three people in weather-related traffic accidents Sunday and Monday. The first two occurred Sunday in northern California, the area first hit by the weather. A 14-year-old boy died on Interstate 80 about 11 a.m. Sunday when the truck he was traveling in skidded off the road on a steep snow-covered grade, said California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Jeanie Hoatson. A second person was killed on State Route 89 about 45 minutes later when the vehicle they were driving went out of control and collided with a second vehicle, she said. In Indiana on Monday, a 21-year-old man died on Interstate 65, northwest of Indianapolis, state police said. The man was involved in one of two weather-related crashes on the road as snow fell, and was struck by a semitrailer truck when he stepped out of his car, Indiana State Police said. Numerous traffic accidents were reported in states experiencing winter weather conditions as the disturbance moved across and into the Midwest, affecting Ohio and Wisconsin. Forecasters warned that the approaching storm could cause widespread power outages through Wednesday and make travel nearly impossible in some areas. It may spread arctic air southward by midweek. Some parts of Iowa could receive up to 10 inches of snow, according to CNN affiliate KCCI. The state already received up to 5 inches of snow from the disturbance Sunday. Chicago, Illinois, received about an inch of snow through Monday morning, said CNN iReporter Alan Hawkins. The sun came out and began to melt the snow, but by late morning the sky was overcast again. More cold temperatures and snow are forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday, he said. ""Today's just kind of a taste of what we're going to get."" CNN iReporters in Kentucky and Indiana reported snow, but said it was melting as of late morning. Is it snowing where you live? Send photos, video . Some snow also fell in mountainous areas of Arizona early Monday as the major storm moved in. Winter storm warnings stretched as far south as Tucson. Blizzard warnings are in effect for parts of the central Rockies and the Mogollon Rim in Arizona, where up to 2 feet of snow and wind gusts of 50 mph could cause whiteouts, forecasters said. Wind chills of 30 to 40 degrees below zero are forecast for the Midwest and the northern Plains, and afternoon temperatures may be in the single digits through Wednesday. The storm is forecast to intensify Monday as it strikes California and heads northeast toward the Rockies, forecasters said Sunday. Winter storm warnings are in effect for the Sierra Range southward to the San Bernardino mountains in Southern California. The area was set to experience heavy snow on Monday, with up to 3 feet possible in the higher elevations. Southern California may get wind gusts of 60 mph on Monday, which could damage trees, power lines and communication towers. Heavy rains were also forecast, triggering possibilities of mudslides and debris flows especially in burn areas. The storm is expected to intensify Tuesday as it moves northeast into the Midwest and upper Great Lakes. Winter storm watches are in effect for the regions, with blizzard conditions possible in northern Iowa and southern Minnesota on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the storm will move into southern Canada as the coldest air of the season spills across the central United States, forecasters said. Many temperatures will be below zero Thursday morning and daytime highs will struggle to make it out of the single digits across the upper Great Lakes, according to forecasters.

20,"(CNN)  -- In a messy drug bust this week, investigators uncovered more than 700 pounds of marijuana stuffed in a septic tank truck full of human waste, Arizona police said Friday. And the search of the truck was as awful as it sounds. ""Yeah, that really does suck,"" Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Bart Graves told CNN. ""It's a long way to go to make a bust."" Hidden in the holding tank of the truck were 743 pounds of pot, worth about $409,000 on the street, police said in a news release. An officer pulled over the septic tank truck Wednesday after a check of the license showed it was invalid, police said. The truck was headed northbound on I-19 and stopped about 35 miles south of Tucson, Arizona. Police patrolling the area tend to be more vigilant, Graves said, because the interstate -- which leads directly to Mexico -- is a major thoroughfare for drug and human trafficking. After the stop, the officer discovered that the commercial vehicle markings on the truck were also invalid. A subsequent search revealed the bales of marijuana in red and orange packages amid the waste. ""It just shows how desperate these drug cartels are,"" Graves said. ""They'll go to any lengths to conceal their product. We've seen it concealed [among] watermelons, bell peppers. This is the first time we've seen it concealed in human waste."" Police arrested the driver, Leonard Salcido, 24, of Tucson, and charged him with possession of marijuana, possession of marijuana for sale and transportation of marijuana, police said. The bust was not the largest for Arizona police. In 2008, police found more than 2,000 pounds of marijuana in a fake UPS truck, Graves said. Wednesday's smelly pot was just one major bust this week. On Thursday, police confiscated $681,000 worth of methamphetamine concealed in the false floor of a vehicle. The driver was stopped for speeding on I-17 near Camp Verde, Arizona, police said. The officer asked to search the vehicle and found 15 pounds of meth, police said.","Police stopped truck on interstate, about 35 miles south of Tucson, Arizona .

21,"Arlington, Virginia (CNN) -- The mantra in Washington during the current winter storm is ""stay home,"" but some doctors and nurses really do need to get to hospitals to take care of the sick. So, many of them rely on a group of hardy volunteer drivers for transport. Adrian Stanton was running Virginia Hospital Center's command center Wednesday morning, coordinating the driver pickups and drop-offs. He described the volunteer drivers as ""unbelievable saviors for us."" One of those volunteers is Scott Long, who left his home at 6 a.m. to pick up two nurses before heading to the hospital, where he picked up another nurse to take her home. Long initially said he does it because he thinks it's the right thing to do. But he later admitted he also does it because it he enjoys it. ""My wife can stay with the kids. I get to play in the snow and nobody can yell at me for being out driving in the snow,"" he told CNN. ""I had a police officer the first day pull up at a stoplight and yell at me for being on the road. I told him I was driving for the hospital and he laughed and said, 'Well then, have fun.'"" Long drives a 1995 Jeep Wrangler for his pick-ups. He says he likes the Jeep better than his four-wheel drive. ""The reason is the short wheel base. I can actually turn around in a single lane in traffic, whereas if I had my bigger four-wheel drive, it doesn't turn around and it's not as nimble,"" he said. As Long was making that point, his Jeep started sliding sideways along the road. But he didn't miss a beat as he regained control. ""Like where we just slid out there, the Jeep can handle it better than the truck,"" he said. The volunteer drivers are offered a gas voucher from the hospital, but Stanton said most of them turn it down. Stanton has an active list of about 30 people who drive for the hospital during inclement weather. Wednesday morning he said the drivers had done somewhere near 50 pick-ups and drop-offs in the previous 24 hours. The hospital workers appreciate the volunteer drivers. ""I didn't have any other options,"" said James Schmidt. He heard about the rides from e-mails and texts that the hospital sent to its employees. One intensive-care nurse said she had driven herself to work the past few days. ""I don't know how I made it,"" she said, adding, ""God bless"" the drivers. One night-shift supervisor named Lynne said she received a ride from Long on Thursday morning. She lives only a few miles from the hospital, but didn't think she would be able to make it home in the snow. Lynne said, ""This is worse than ..."" Long finished her sentence: ""... anything so far.""","About 30 people drive for Virginia Hospital Center during inclement weather .

22,"(CNN) -- A storm has barreled into the Southeast and sections of the Northeast, coating power lines and roads with ice and leaving thousands without power. More heavy snow was predicted for Mid-Atlantic cities, some of which already have record amounts, the National Weather Service said Saturday. Asheville, North Carolina, recorded 11 inches of snow on Friday. The weather service said less than a half-inch of snow should fall during the day, turning to freezing drizzle at night. There was an ice storm warning for the Carolinas until midnight. ""Ice accumulations of one-quarter to one-half inch are expected,"" forecasters said. ""Elevated surfaces such as trees, power lines and highway bridges and overpasses will accumulate ice most easily."" North Carolina's Department of Transportation asked motorists to avoid all unnecessary travel. The town of Cary, North Carolina, canceled its Winter Wonderland festival because of the storm. A foot of snow was expected in parts of Virginia, where iReporter William Bernstein, Jr. said people are ""just not used to this."" A typical snowstorm in Virginia Beach, located about 20 minutes from Norfolk, usually yields about 4 to 5 inches of snow, Bernstein said. But by 8 a.m., snowfall had well surpassed the norm. ""Nobody is really out on the roads,"" he said. ""They've closed off ramps and on ramps in downtown Norfolk."" See pictures from Virginia Beach on iReport.com . Washington and Baltimore, Maryland, were expected to get 4 to 6 inches of snow. Motorists were being warned to stay off the roadways, D.C. officials said. Forecasters warned that gusty winds in several states may topple ice laden trees and power lines. A Home Depot store in Spartanburg, South Carolina, saw a run on generators, fire logs and ice-melting chemicals Friday, and Spartanburg County called in extra dispatchers to handle emergency calls, CNN affiliate WYFF reported. Watch the snow pile up in Tennessee . Several inches of sleet covered the ground in the town of Travelers Rest, South Carolina, WYFF's Sean Muserallo reported. Brian Wood of Marietta, South Carolina, told WYFF his car was ""fish-tailing all the way"" as he drove to work at a restaurant Saturday morning. ""It's definitely not driving weather."" Tennessee's Transportation Department said highways statewide had patches of snow and ice, and trucks were spreading salt on roads across much of the eastern part of the state. How's the weather where you are? Send photos, video . The storm moved north and east Friday from the Southern Plains of Oklahoma and Texas. Oklahoma City was coated with ice and shivering with a daytime high of 20 degrees, said CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. In Dallas, Texas, it was 26 degrees. Oklahoma's Corporation Commission said Saturday that more than 108,000 homes and businesses were without power. Gov. Brad Henry had declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, ahead of the storm. President Obama signed a disaster declaration for Oklahoma on Saturday, authorizing federal aid to the hard-hit state. In northern Georgia on Saturday, about 1,200 customers were without power, down from 5,000 earlier in the day, the Electric Membership Cooperatives said in a written statement. They said the outages were caused by trees falling on power lines, and that power should be restored by late afternoon. School systems and communities in northeastern Georgia also canceled numerous weekend activities, CNN affiliate WNEG reported. Some are determined not to let the weather keep them indoors. iReporter Katy Hawkins of Norman, Oklahoma, said she and her roommate went outside to play in the snow after spending most of the day inside. ""Oklahoma does not usually get enough snow to make a snowball, but yesterday we had at least 7 inches in the Norman area,"" she said. In her apartment complex's parking lot, most cars had at least a half-inch of ice encasing the whole car and then snow on top of that, she said. ""I spent 30 minutes trying to pry my door open and finally just gave up and went to take pictures instead!""","NEW: iReporters in areas unaccustomed to heavy snowfall enjoy the novelty .

23,"(CNN) -- Haiti's orphanages have become targets for people desperate for food, water and medical supplies in the aftermath of the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake. On Wednesday night, Maison de Lumiere, an orphanage caring for 50 orphans, came under attack from a group of 20 armed men, aid workers told the Joint Council on International Children's Services. A neighboring orphanage sheltering about 135 children has been robbed several times over the past few days, they said. Meanwhile, aid workers said a third orphanage caring for 17 orphans reported that townspeople are trespassing and tapping into the water supply that is reserved for the children. ""It was calm at first, but the situation is getting more desperate,"" said David Beck, pastor at Child Hope International, the nonprofit that oversees Maison de Lumiere. No shots were fired in the attack on the orphanage, and security guards were able to drive off the marauders, he said. But one orphanage worker was hit in the head with a rock, he said. ""If people think you have food, then they will come after it,"" Beck said. The orphanage is rationing what food and water it does have, he said. Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere, and experienced high rates of poverty and disease even before the quake. The quake has made the situation far more desperate. Looting is becoming a big concern for the orphanages as fear and frustration mount and help is slow to arrive, said Tom DiFilipo of the Joint Council on International Children's Services, a U.S.-based advocacy group for children in need of families. To protect the children, some orphanages are on lock-down, according to volunteers working with the relief agencies. ""When bringing in supplies to an orphanage, you can only bring in a day or two day's worth,"" said DiFilipo. ""If you bring more than that, the locals come in."" This week's raids are included on a growing list of difficulties facing orphanages that is being compiled by the Joint Council on International Children's Services. DiFilipo said he expects the challenges of food, medical aid and security to continue affecting the orphanages for weeks. For every Haitian orphan brought to safety in the United States and elsewhere, thousands more are left behind to face the primitive conditions resulting from last week's earthquake. There is no accurate count of how many orphanages have experienced looting and other attacks. Since the quake, the Joint Council on International Children's Services has received dozens of phone calls, text messages and e-mails from orphanages reporting problems ranging from food shortages to security threats. The agency is in touch with about 50 orphanages in Haiti and the reports are updated daily. The group is also working with members of Congress, the Red Cross and other aid agencies to relay the messages. Before the quake, Haiti had 380,000 orphans, according to UNICEF. It is still too early to determine how many children were orphaned by the quake. The people of Haiti have grown desperate for food, water and assistance since the quake decimated the capital last week, toppling buildings, cutting power, contaminating water supplies and ravaging roads. The conditions for children in Haiti are bleak, aid officials said. Orphans are sleeping outside or in makeshift tents. Facilities are running low on food, water and medical supplies. Some orphanages have already reported deaths. Ruuska Village, an orphanage in the Bon Repos section of Port-au-Prince, was looted several times during the first few days after the quake, said volunteer Cherie Shropshire. Security was inadequate after 80 percent of the building was damaged, she said. The locks were broken and people stole food, clothes and supplies, but the orphanage was able to keep its generator protected, Shropshire said. ""Another aftershock that woke us so roughly on Wednesday morning and a wall tumbling down on our heads, children starving, the orphanage being looted as the frustration continues to grow regarding the delay in distributing supplies, children dying from sickness. ...,"" wrote an American adoption service provider in Haiti in a blog run by the Joint Council on International Children's Services. Reporting crimes to police is nearly impossible for officials at the damaged orphanages. Many Haitian police officers were injured or killed in the earthquake. Help from private security officers also is hindered by unreliable communication and poor transportation. Security needs to be made a higher priority, said Daniel Kaniewski, deputy director of George Washington University's Homeland Security Policy Institute. On Tuesday, the United Nations Security Council approved a proposal to send an additional 2,000 soldiers and 1,500 police officers to Haiti. ""Providing security resources is as equally important as providing all of the other kinds of aid in the country,"" Kaniewski said. ""Without security, you won't be able to effectively distribute to the most needed areas in Haiti."" At Maison de Lumiere, where looters raided on Wednesday night, Beck sees both sides of the story. ""On one hand, the people around the orphanage have been incredibly gracious and mutually supportive since the earthquake,"" he said. ""On the other hand, last night's attack reminds us that there are a few aggressive people whose growing desperation can drive them to attempt to take others' food and water by force.""","20 men attacked Maison de Lumiere, an orphanage in Port-au-Prince, aid workers say .

24,"(CNN) -- Thirty to 40 ships -- including several passenger ships -- were stuck Thursday in ice off the coast of Sweden, said a spokesman for the Maritime Search and Rescue Center in Gothenburg, Sweden. The area of the Baltic Sea worst hit by the ice were the waters bounded by mainland Sweden, the Stockholm archipelago and the Finnish island of Aland, said Tommy Gardebring, press officer with the Swedish Maritime Administration. The center identified one of the passenger ships as the Amorella, with 753 passengers and 190 crew members. Several passenger vessels from Viking Line were stuck, he said. One of them had been freed. ""It has been a lot colder than normal in the southern parts of the Baltic sea, but in the north all is normal with normal levels of ice,"" Gardebring said. ""However, in the worst-affected areas, the ice breakers that normally operate haven't been able to cope with the ice, which is why we are sending additional ice breakers."" The extra help was expected to arrive around midnight (6 p.m. ET), he said. ""There was never any danger for the safety of the vessels, but we have increased our preparedness, just in case, since the ice puts a lot of pressure on the sides of the ships,"" Gardebring said. He predicted that most of the ships would be freed by Friday.

25,"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Kashi Shodeinde turned the ignition and his battered truck convulsed as black fumes poured from the exhaust. His precious cargo of bottled Guinness beer rattled as he set off into the gauntlet of Lagos' potholed roads and traffic. Nigeria consumes more Guinness beer than Ireland, the company says. Working for a foreign company to send his three children to school, Shodeinde is on the frontline of private investors' struggle to gain a foothold in Nigeria. ""In the whole of Nigeria, Guinness is No. 1!"" he exclaimed. Brewed in Nigeria since 1962, the country's thicker-tasting ""Foreign Extra"" is not just supporting Shodeinde and his family, but helped Guinness Nigeria defy the global recession with 6 percent annual growth this year, according to the company. Nigeria now drinks more Guinness than Ireland -- making it the second-biggest consumer in the world, after Britain, according to Guinness Nigeria. A success story like Guinness in Nigeria highlights the potential for trade and foreign investment in Africa that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about last week when she addressed an African trade convention in Kenya. ""Africa is capable, and is making economic progress. In fact, one doesn't have to look far to see that Africa is ripe with opportunities, some already realized, and others waiting to be seized together if we determine to do so,"" Clinton said. She is on a tour of Africa to promote development and good governance, and to underscore the Obama administration's commitment to Africa. Nigeria is one of several countries on her itinerary. But many challenges keep foreign businesses from coming to Nigeria. Regarded as a frontier market, Nigeria is ranked 118 out of 187 in the World Bank's ""Doing Business"" rankings. Failing infrastructure, irregular electricity and erratic government policies have caused foreign investors to shy from Nigeria's relatively untapped market of 150 million people. ""Nigeria remains an information dark spot and therefore does itself no advantage in terms of trying to attract foreign investment,"" said Doyin Salami, an economist at Lagos Business School. The Dunlop and Michelin tire companies have in recent years closed their factories in Nigeria, because of the rising cost of production. Yet, Nigeria Guinness is expanding its facilities to increase production. ""Business is really growing,"" said Afebuameh Cephas, the plant manager for Guinness' Benin factory, saying production was up almost 30 percent in a year. All the ingredients are produced locally -- except for Guinness extract, a secret ingredient added to Guinness brewed anywhere in the world. But there's no secret to Guinness' Nigeria success, said Chairman Tunde Savage. ""The most important thing here is you have to be very transparent in what you do. Your governing principle must be very clear here. You must ensure you do things correctly and rightly."" Fortunately for competitors, Guinness is not to everyone's taste. Bottles of all shapes and flavors rattled on a bar table in Lagos one recent night as a band struck a deep bass note in the humidity of the night. ""It's too harsh! It's too harsh!"" one regular exclaimed. ""It tastes good for an African man!"" argued another.","Guinness beer plant in Nigeria expanding facilities as business thrives .

26,"Washington (CNN) -- Flights transporting critically injured Haitians into the United States will resume within a few hours, the White House announced Sunday afternoon. The flights were temporarily suspended because of logistical issues including space to care for the injured, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Saturday. ""Having received assurances that additional capacity exists both here and among our international partners, we determined that we can resume these critical flights,"" he said in a statement Sunday. Full coverage . The statement, released Sunday afternoon, said flights would resume ""in the next 12 hours."" The evacuated patients are those whose medical needs could not be met by doctors working in Haiti. Nearly 23,000 people have been seen by U.S. personnel since the January 12 earthquake, Vietor said. Some volunteer American doctors in Haiti expect the flights to resume at 11 a.m. Monday, according to Nery Ynclan, a spokeswoman for Dr. Barth Green, of the University of Miami, who is leading a team of volunteers in Port-au-Prince. Airlifts stopped after there were ""concerns about the strain on domestic health capacity,"" Vietor said. But officials have increased the ability to care for patients through a network of nonprofits and U.S. hospitals, he said. But earlier reports also cited questions over who would pay for patients' care. The missing, the found, the victims . The flights stopped Wednesday when some states refused to allow entry to Haitians needing care, according to Navy Capt. Kevin Aandahl, a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Command. He would not say which states objected. In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius obtained by CNN, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist asked that the federal government activate the National Disaster Medical System to provide reimbursement to Florida and other states for taking in the patients, who have no insurance. Florida's health facilities were already strained by winter tourism and seasonal residence migration, Crist said in the letter. But Florida officials said Saturday that the state was committed to assisting Haitian quake victims and had not asked the airlifts be halted. Florida will play a role in caregiving once flights resume. The state has identified medical facilities that could take in victims, Vietor said in Sunday's statement.

27,"(CNN) -- The living quarters of a fire station in Maryland exploded and burned Thursday after its snow-laden roof collapsed in the wake of the pair of record-setting snowstorms that howled through the mid-Atlantic region in the past week, state police said. Crushed roofs were not uncommon in the region -- authorities in the District of Columbia reported 22 such incidents as a result of the heavy snowfall -- but the collapse at the Sykesville Freedom District Fire Department stood out because it punctured a natural gas line, igniting the blaze, officials said. Firefighters were out on a call when the roof fell about 7:40 a.m., Carroll County spokeswoman Vivian Laxton told CNN affiliate WBAL-TV. No injuries were reported. In the aftermath of what some are calling ""snowmageddon,"" thousands of people were without power and transportation departments were still trying to clean snowy, icy streets Thursday. In Washington, more than 250,000 federal workers were told to stay home from work for a fourth day, and public schools were closed. But in New York, children went back to school after a three-day ""holiday."" After a storm that dumped more than 30 inches of snow in some places last weekend, the latest part of the one-two punch dropped 22.5 inches on Baltimore, Maryland, 15.8 inches on Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and about 10 inches on Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, Central Park in New York and Atlantic City, New Jersey, the National Weather Service said. Records for total snowfall for the season have been set at Dulles International Airport west of Washington, with 72 inches; Philadelphia, with 70.3; Baltimore, with 70.1; Reagan Washington National Airport, with 55.6; and Atlantic City, with 48.7, according to the weather service. The snow brought down tree limbs that in turn pulled down power lines. Ricky Watkins of Petersburg, in central Virginia, sent in a CNN iReport of a transformer near his home that erupted in sparks and flames after a tree downed power lines there Wednesday morning. Although he said he was ""used to the snow"" after working in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Chicago, Illinois, he said he had never seen a display like the one the transformer put on. ""I was not about to get any closer,"" he said. ""It appeared that a transformer had fallen into a nearby tree and was about to catch it and the house on fire."" He said his power went out about 8 a.m. Wednesday but was back on by about 2:15 that afternoon. Dominion Virginia Power reported only 3,400 outages by Thursday afternoon, most of them in southeast Virginia, but it was unclear whether all of those were storm-related, said utility spokeswoman La-Ha Anderson. ""We hope to have anybody affected by the storm yesterday to be back on today,"" she said. Dominion serves 2.4 million customers from the Washington metropolitan area to northern North Carolina. Potomac Electric Power Co., which serves Washington and Maryland, had 1,900 customers without power, PEPCO spokesman Bob Hainey said Thursday morning. The utility hopes to get everybody's service restored by Friday, he said. ""We're cautiously optimistic,"" he said. ""Our goal is to get everyone back on as soon as possible."" Dulles International Airport and Reagan National Airport reopened Thursday after closing to flights Wednesday afternoon. Amtrak was still providing limited service for Washington, New York and Boston, Massachusetts, on Thursday, but most passenger rail service south of Washington was canceled. Amtrak said the weather had downed trees and power lines on portions of freight railroad tracks south of Washington, ""requiring continued service cancellations in Virginia, and the Carolinas."" Seth Bishop, 18, a freshman at George Washington University, where classes were canceled, said he was unfazed by the snow. ""I'm originally from New Hampshire, so I'm used to snow,"" he told CNN's iReport. He said he had a good time touring the outside of snow-covered monuments on the National Mall and viewing sites in the northwest business district. ""It's pretty eerie, actually, because no one was around."" Bishop said he also was busy with other pursuits. ""I've been going through a bunch of snowball fights [and] getting some extra work done for classes."" As the mid-Atlantic region was digging out Thursday, another snowstorm was hitting Texas. Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport had recorded more than 6 inches by mid-afternoon Thursday. It was the most snow recorded at the airport since 7.5 inches on February 17, 1978. The new storm was taking a more southerly route than the previous two. Accumulations of up to 5 inches were predicted for parts of southeast Mississippi and southwest and south central Alabama overnight Thursday into Friday. Although the amount of snowfall predicted lessens as the storm moves through Georgia and South Carolina on Friday, isolated spots could see up to 6 inches, forecasters said.

28,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Three U.S. Navy aviators are missing at sea after a command and control plane crashed over the Atlantic on Wednesday night, Navy officials said Thursday. The E-2C Hawkeye is a command and control aircraft. The E-2C  Hawkeye was conducting exercises off the Virginia-North Carolina coast. The plane crashed after it launched from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman about 11 p.m. Wednesday, Navy officials said. Navy officials said they do not know what caused the plane to crash, and search and rescue missions are under way from units on the Truman, the carrier USS Eisenhower and the Coast Guard. The twin-engine plane usually carries a crew of five, but had only three aboard during the flight. The plane was part of a training squadron, VAW 120, and is based at the Naval Station Norfolk in southern Virginia. E-mail to a friend .

29,"(CNN) -- The captain and chief officer of a Chinese-registered ship that ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef will appear in an Australian court Thursday, charged with damaging the reef. The Shen Neng 1 veered more than 27 kilometers (17 miles) off course and ended up on a shoal in the Reef on April 3, prompting concerns of an oil spill near the world's largest coral reef system. On Wednesday, the Australian Federal Police announced that they have arrested the 47-year-old Chinese master of the vessel and the 44-year-old chief officer. The captain was charged with liability for the vessel. He faces a maximum fine of A$55,000 (U.S. $50,852). The chief officer is accused of being on watch when the ship caused the damage. He faces up to three years in prison and a fine of A$220,000 (U.S. $203,411). Authorities did not disclose the name of either man. The ship was carrying about 65,000 tons of coal to China from the Australian port of Gladstone when it ran aground on the shoal -- a combination of shell and sand -- near the southernmost point of the Great Barrier Reef, just north of Great Keppel Island. About 950 tons of oil were on board. A small oil slick caused by the ship's grounding did not threaten the Great Barrier Reef after crews sprayed dispersants on it and surface netting helped to contain it. Officials said the ship's captain had a 10-mile-wide channel to navigate through in an area where pilots aren't needed -- a relatively wide open section of sea, 70 kilometers (43 miles) off shore and away from the larger mass of coral most people associate with the Great Barrier Reef. ""He got 15 nautical miles (17.3 miles) off course, which is just outrageous,"" Adam Nicholson, a spokesman for Maritime Safety Queensland, said at the time. Nicholson likened it to a car veering off a 2-mile wide road. ""We have thousands of boats moving in that same space every year and nothing has ever happened like this,"" he said. The Great Barrier Reef is made up of roughly 3,000 individual reefs and 900 islands spanning over 2,600 km (1,600 miles) off the coast of Queensland in the Coral Sea.","Chinese ship officers to appear in court after veering onto Great Barrier Reef .

30,"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Nearly 150,000 homes were without drinking water Monday after the worst floodwaters in 60 years swamped large areas of western England. Flooding has caused widespread disruption across the country with further regions braced for more floods. British military and rescue workers battled to save a major electricity substation on the outskirts of Gloucester, England, that serves about 500,000 homes. About 1,000 Royal Navy personnel were building an emergency barrier to keep the Walham substation from flooding. Their efforts have been successful so far, the Gloucestershire Constabulary Emergency Services said Monday evening. Some 50,000 homes were already without electricity before the substation was threatened. Two major rivers -- the Thames and the Severn -- are well above their normal levels and may burst their banks, according to authorities.  Watch as Britons brace for more flooding » . Britain's Environment Agency warned water levels could rise further to a ""critical level"" and issued nine severe flood warnings across the country. The worst affected areas are the counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Oxfordshire, which had more than 5 inches (12.5 cm) of rain in barely 24 hours. More rain is forecast, and the risk of flooding is increasing as floodwaters work their way into the river system. In the historic city of Gloucester, the River Severn is expected to burst its banks later Monday. The river is already nearly 15 feet (5 meters) above its normal level for this time of year and close to breaching its banks.  See residents walk through flooded streets and homes » . Electricity and water supplies in and around the city are already cut to many residents, after a water treatment plant and electricity sub-station were flooded. The city of Tewkesbury is also flooded -- video from the area showed dozens of cars and homes under several feet of water. Officials said it would be at least 48 hours before they could gain access to the Mythe Water Pumping Station in Tewkesbury to return water supply to 70,000 customers in Tewkesbury, Gloucester and Cheltenham. ""There is no doubt this unprecedented situation has been testing for each and every one of the emergency services and our partner agencies,"" said Gloucestershire Chief Constable Timothy Brain. ""I must pay tribute to the marathon effort being made to prevent the situation from worsening and to support those affected by the flooding, loss of power, loss of water and other consequences of this extreme situation,"" he said. Hundreds of people in the worst affected areas have been plucked to safety by helicopters of the Royal Air Force and boats. Further north in Evesham, the River Severn is more than twice its normal width. So far this month England has had nearly two-and-a-half-times its normal rainfall. Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited Gloucester -- and promised to mobilize resources from across the country. He also announced increased funding for flood and coastal defenses across the country. ""Like every advanced industrialized country, we are coming to terms with the issues surrounding climate change,"" he said. The prime minister described the flooding as unprecedented, and brushed aside criticism of his government for the quality of flood defenses and a slow response to the crisis. ""I think the emergency services have done a great job,"" he said. ""I am satisfied people are doing everything they can."" The wet weather for much of June and July across England and Wales has also affected crops. Farmers are predicting low yields and higher prices -- with several crops due to be harvested in the next month. Insurance companies are expecting claims worth hundreds of millions of dollars because of flood damage. More than 2,000 people spent Sunday night in emergency accommodation and the Royal Air Force and coastguard helicopters airlifted hundreds to safety in one of Britain's largest peacetime rescue operations. ""I'm afraid to say that I don't think we have seen the peak yet,"" John Harman, of the Environment Agency, told BBC radio. ""All this water that we have seen ... is now into the river system. Even though the rain has eased off a bit ... it's the water in the rivers now that constitutes a threat."" E-mail to a friend .","Flood waters in parts of England at 60-year highs .

31,"(CNN) -- Search efforts turned into a recovery operation Monday for a U.S. Navy instructor pilot presumed dead after his plane crashed into Lake Pontchartrain, just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana, during a routine training mission, a Navy spokesman said. The student pilot on the plane was rescued about two hours after the crash Saturday night and taken to a hospital for mild hypothermia and moderate injuries, according to the Navy. He has since been released. The missing instructor pilot has been identified as Lt. Clinton Wermers, 33, of Mitchell, South Dakota. The Navy did not identify the rescued student pilot. The two pilots were attached to Training Squadron 6 at Naval Air Station Whiting Field in Milton, Florida. Initial reports were that both the pilots were clinging to the aircraft before it sank, according to the U.S. Coast Guard, which is assisting in the search. Lt. Brett Dawson, a Navy air training spokesman, told CNN Monday that the wreckage of the plane has been located and a salvage unit will be working to recover it. The cause of the crash is under investigation, Dawson said. Air traffic controllers at Lakefront Airport in New Orleans notified the Coast Guard at 6:40 p.m. Saturday that a U.S. Navy T-34 training plane was no longer visible on radar, the Coast Guard said in a news release. The plane had been approaching the airport during a routine nighttime instrument training mission, the Navy said. The T-34 is a single-engine, single-prop plane used for primary training for student pilots. It does not have an ejection mechanism, Dawson said. Instead, pilots can open the canopy, slide it back and roll out of the aircraft. At the time of the crash, the temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit with calm winds, the Coast Guard said. The water temperature was 52 degrees. CNN's Sarah Aarthun and Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","Search efforts turned into a recovery operation Monday after T-34 crashed Saturday night .

32,"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. missile defense test failed Sunday when a long-range missile missed its target because of radar problems. The Defense Department said a target missile was launched from an Army test site at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands at 7:40 p.m. Six minutes later, a second missile was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, to find the first one and destroy it. Both missiles flew successfully, but missed each other because of a problem in the sea-based X-band radar, the department's Missile Defense Agency said. The X-band radar sits atop a modified floating oil platform and provides information about incoming missiles so military officials can launch a response. ""Both the target missile and ground-based interceptor performed nominally after launch. However, the sea-based X-band radar did not perform as expected,"" the agency said. Officials intend to investigate the cause of the interception failure.","Test missile fired from Pacific atoll .

34,"(CNN) -- After reviewing the case of a woman who died at New Orleans, Louisiana's Memorial Hospital in the days after Hurricane Katrina, coroner Frank Minyard said Thursday that he cannot classify her death as a homicide. Minyard said he hopes his findings on the death of Jannie Burgess, 79, will mark ""the end of the Memorial Hospital hurricane situation."" The review was initiated after an August 2009 New York Times article quoted a doctor as saying Memorial patients were given morphine and other drugs after Katrina struck in August 2005, with hospital staff knowing that it could hasten some of the patients' deaths. Burgess' manner of death is unclassified, the coroner said, and the cause of her death undetermined. ""I don't think -- and I could be wrong -- I don't think the morphine contributed as much to her demise as her physical condition,"" said Minyard, who's served as the coroner of Orleans Parish since 1974. ""This patient was extremely sick,"" Minyard said of Burgess. The woman had had surgery a week before and had been on ""morphine around the clock. She'd had kidney failure. She'd had liver failure."" She also had developed sepsis, or blood poisoning, he said. Burgess was being treated for advanced uterine cancer and kidney failure, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Dr. Ewing Cook told the New York Times that he asked a nurse to increase Burgess' morphine and give her ""enough until she goes."" ""If you don't think that by giving a person a lot of morphine, you're not prematurely sending them to their grave, then you're a very naive doctor,"" Cook told the Times. ""We kill 'em."" On Burgess, he said, ""I gave her medicine so I could get rid of her faster, get the nurses off the floor."" He added, ""There's no question I hastened her demise."" In response to a Times-Picayune report in September, Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro Jr. said he planned to look into the deaths but stopped short of calling it an investigation. Minyard said Thursday that he had delivered a detailed report to Cannizzaro on Wednesday. Because she had been receiving morphine, Burgess had naturally developed some tolerance to it, Minyard said. He also took her weight, 240 pounds, into account. Burgess had received seven 15-milligram shots of morphine and died 3½ hours after receiving the last one, he said. Deaths from morphine, or any narcotic, tend to happen immediately, he said. Minyard said he believes that Burgess' blood poisoning, along with anemia she had before her surgery, mostly contributed to her death. ""I'm saying 'mostly' because we really don't know,"" he said. ""And when you really don't know, you have to be 100 percent sure"" when calling a death a homicide. He said he doesn't believe that Burgess received enough morphine to kill her. Minyard said Thursday that when he told Burgess' relatives about his findings, ""they were very polite."" He said they will come in to speak with him soon. Katrina roared ashore near the Mississippi-Louisiana state line on August 29, 2005, rupturing three of New Orleans' protective levees and putting about three-quarters of the city under water. Charles Foti Jr., who was then the state attorney general, launched an investigation after officials from Lifecare, an acute-care facility operating on the seventh floor of Memorial, reported allegations that several seriously ill, mostly elderly patients had been euthanized by medical staff at Memorial as the floodwaters rose around the hospital and conditions inside deteriorated. In 2006, Foti ordered the arrest of Dr. Anna Pou and two nurses, Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, on preliminary charges of second-degree murder in the deaths of four of the patients. Former Orleans Parish District Attorney Eddie Jordan, who under Louisiana law was responsible for prosecuting crimes, gave Budo and Landry immunity in exchange for their testimony. In July 2007, a grand jury refused to indict Pou. Foti said his investigation revealed that the four patients were given a ""lethal cocktail"" of morphine and midazolam hydrochloride, both central nervous system depressants. The patients were 63, 68, 91 and 93, he said. Pou, Landry and Budo denied the charges, and their attorneys said they acted heroically, staying to treat patients rather than evacuate. In an interview with Newsweek magazine in 2007, Pou admitted giving the patients drugs. ""If in doing so it hastened their deaths, then that's what happened,"" she said. ""But this was not 'I'm going to go to the seventh floor and murder some people.' We're here to help patients."" The grand jury never heard testimony from five specialists who advised Foti that the patients were deliberately killed with overdoses of drugs after Katrina struck. All five were brought in by Foti's office to analyze the deaths and concluded that the patients were homicide victims. After the grand jury refused to indict Pou, Jordan called the case closed and said he would no longer pursue it. CNN and the Times-Picayune have filed suit seeking the release of Foti's investigative file into the deaths. CNN was the first to report the allegations of euthanasia, six weeks after the hurricane. The case went to the Louisiana Supreme Court, which in July sent it back to the trial court to rule on whether criminal charges in the case are reasonably anticipated. No new trial date has been set, Lori Mince, the New Orleans attorney representing the media organization, said Thursday. Hospital workers identified only as John and Jane Does have sued to block the file's release, claiming that the records are covered by grand jury secrecy rules, that they should have been considered confidential informants and that releasing the documents would violate their privacy.","79-year-old Jannie Burgess died in New Orleans hospital .

35,"(CNN) -- A 62-year-old Michigan man was severely burned when a homemade rocket strapped on his back exploded while he slid down a snowy hill on a sled, authorities said this week. The rocket stunt was the grand finale on Saturday during the man's annual sledding party at his Oakland County, Michigan, home, the sheriff's department said. ""He is known for doing 'crazy things' at his parties,"" an Oakland County sheriff's department statement said. ""On this date, after consuming an unknown quantity of alcohol, he constructed a device out of a motorcycle muffler and pipe."" Inside the makeshift rocket, the victim placed gunpowder, heads from matches and gasoline. He donned a helmet and took a sled to the top of a snowy embankment. ""He asked another person to light a wick and then began to sled down a hill. At some point during the ride downhill, the device exploded. The results of the explosion were second-degree burns to the victim's face,"" the sheriff's department statement said. No one else was injured during the incident. The man, whose identity is not yet known, was hospitalized with significant damage to one of his eyes and could face criminal charges, authorities said.","Makeshift rocket sled stunt goes awry for Michigan man, authorities say .

36,"(CNN) -- The same hands that are helping Haiti recover from a massive earthquake could cripple its long-term recovery. That's the concern voiced by some Haitian scholars, natives and relief workers. The world has rallied to Haiti's side since the January 12 earthquake killed at least 217,000 people and displaced at least a million in the impoverished island nation. Yet the same groups that have lined up to help Haitians the past two months -- foreign governments, relief groups and companies pledging to rebuild  -- could hobble Haiti's long-term survival, some say. Ronald Agenor, a Haitian-American, says he's grateful for the world's assistance. But he doesn't want the earthquake to wipe out one of his native country's most precious assets: its independence. ""We're not a country anymore,"" said Agenor, a former top-ranked professional tennis player. ""It doesn't seem like we have a government. We're a place where people go to give money."" How aid can hinder Haiti's government . Much of Haiti's national identity is shaped around its unique history. Haitians are the descendants of the only slaves who revolted against their masters in the 19th century. Haiti, though, has struggled since it broke away from its colonial rulers, the French. Even before the earthquake, unemployment hovered around 50 percent, and more than half of all Haitians live on a dollar a day. Ongoing political instability adds to Haiti's misery. Western nations and relief groups have stepped in over the years to help. But some of that help has backfired, says Alex Dupuy, a native of Haiti and a professor of sociology at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. ""Haiti has been transformed over the years into an aid-dependent country,"" Dupuy said. ""Much of the aid has further weakened the ability of the state to deliver."" In Haiti, the government doesn't provide basic services such as sanitation, electricity and drinking water, Dupuy says. Much of that is provided by non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, like relief groups, he says. ""It becomes a vicious cycle,"" Dupuy said. ""The state is never forced to face up to its responsibilities."" Educated Haitians could stay and help their country, but many prefer to move elsewhere for more comfortable living, Dupuy says. ""There are more Haitian doctors practicing medicine in Montreal than in Haiti,"" Dupuy said. Full earthquake coverage . Those educated Haitians who do stay are often siphoned off into working for the non-governmental organizations stationed there, says J. Phil Thompson, an urban studies professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has traveled to disaster zones around the world to help communities recover. Thompson says there are about 10,000 NGOs in Haiti. ""Haitians often don't want to work for the government, because the salaries can't compete with the donations various intermediaries can pay,"" Thompson said. Profiting from Haiti's misery . Helping hands have hurt Haiti in the past, some Haitians say. Powerful outsiders took advantage of Haiti's weakened government for profit. Dupuy says that in the early 1970s, Haiti was self-sufficient in its rice production. Today, it is the fourth largest importer of rice from American farmers who are subsidized by the U.S. government. The change came about because much of the foreign aid to Haiti had strings attached. Haiti had to remove its tariffs and open its economy to foreign imports, he says. ""All of which had devastating impacts on Haitian agriculture,"" Dupuy said. ""Haiti has nothing to show for it. Now it imports 25 percent of the food it consumes."" Haiti's impoverished condition also provides opportunity for companies that flock to the country. ""It's being used as a haven for cheap labor in the textiles and garment industries,"" Dupuy says. ""Those industries are going to Haiti because there is an abundance of the cheapest labor in the Western hemisphere."" Even those companies that promise to help rebuild Haiti must be viewed with suspicion, one scholar says. Haiti's recovery could be hampered by unscrupulous outsiders and opportunistic Haitians who may seize land for themselves by passing their efforts off as ""helping the recovery,"" Thompson said. After Hurricane Katrina wiped out the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans, Louisiana, a group of developers proposed turning the area into a golf course, Thompson says. After the 2004 Asian tsunami, developers proposed building luxury hotels on the fishing communities that had just been wiped out, he added. The same pattern could repeat itself in Port-au-Prince, the capital, to ""redevelop"" Haiti, Thompson says. ""Everywhere I've worked, where there's been a disaster, there's been land grabs by the elite,"" Thompson said. Haitians say how their country can recover . Haitians can come out of this disaster stronger if they take more control of their destiny, Thompson says. Thompson suggests that Haitians create a social investment fund, which would be used to funnel money that expatriates send to their homeland into investments in renewable energy, education and housing. It's been estimated that up to 36 percent of Haiti's gross national product comes from remittances, or money Haitians receive from other Haitians abroad. ""Because Haitians are investing in Haiti, they are going to make sure no one is ripped off,"" Thompson said of the investment fund. Agenor, the Haitian-American tennis player, recommends an even more subtle change for improving his country's prospects: teach more English to Haitian youth. Creole and French are the primary languages in Haiti. But the best employment opportunities for Haitians rest about an hour's flight away in the U.S., where English is the main language, Agenor says. ""We have a French culture, but we're so close to America,"" said Agenor, who now lives in Los Angeles, California. ""When Haitians go to America, they don't speak English. They can't go to college. When other English-speaking islanders go to America, 80 percent of the job is done."" Relief groups can help Haitians in the short term by not only providing food, shelter and water but  by hiring Haitian workers in reconstruction projects and soliciting their advice, one relief expert says. ""There's nothing worse than a bunch of foreigners coming in to fix everything,"" said David Humphries, a spokesman for CHF International, a humanitarian organization that is in Haiti. ""Self-esteem and buy-in are very important for any community. They need to say, 'This is our building, our hospital.' "" iReport: Haiti's missing and found . Local input can also avoid wasting precious resources, Humphries says. ""You can build a hospital, but if there's no functional road to it, it's a white elephant,"" Humphries said. ""People will despise it. Go in the community, get their input and employ them."" Despite the challenges ahead, some Haitians remain optimistic. News accounts of the earthquake's aftermath are filled with stories about the resilience of Haitian people. Maggie Boyer, a Haitian native who is communications director for World Vision, an international Christian humanitarian agency, says the street vendors and the colorful Tap-Tap taxicabs have returned to the streets of Port-au-Prince. ""Given our history as the first black republic,"" Boyer said, ""this has left us with the sense that we are good, we can win, and we can go forward.""","Massive aid flowing into Haiti could hobble country's recovery, some say .

38,"(CNN) -- A preliminary autopsy on the body of an energy executive pulled from the Mississippi River in New Orleans, Louisiana, this week revealed a head laceration and evidence of drowning, investigators said Thursday. The body was found Tuesday, four days after Douglas Schantz, president of Houston, Texas-based Sequent Energy Management, disappeared. A toxicology report, due back in roughly three weeks, will show ""how much Schantz had to drink before falling into the Mississippi"" last week, said John Gagliano, lead investigator at the New Orleans coroner's office. Authorities recovered Schantz's body around noon Tuesday, said police spokesman Gary Flot. Police said Schantz was found with all his personal belongings, including his wallet, credit cards, identification and jewelry. Schantz, 54, was last seen outside a Bourbon Street bar at 2:06 a.m. Friday, New Orleans Police Superintendent Warren Riley told reporters Tuesday morning. No one had heard from him since then. At the Tuesday morning news conference, Riley said detectives reviewed video from ""almost every"" business in the busy French Quarter. Several cameras captured a ""disoriented"" Schantz walking alone from a bar toward the Mississippi River, Riley said. Schantz had been drinking, Riley said, and was headed toward a boat at the wharf. ""The last video of Mr. Schantz is when he was near the boat Natchez, walking on a 2- to 3-foot-wide walkway near the river,"" Riley said. ""From 2:40 until 6:40 a.m. video was watched and ... once he [Schantz] walked out of that frame near the Natchez, he never returned on any frames of the video."" Riley said that according to the video, no one approached Schantz during the walk. Texas Equusearch, a search-and-rescue team, searched the waters with sonar equipment, and the Coast Guard and Harbor Police had also joined the search, according to Riley. Family and friends said they knew something was wrong Friday morning when Schantz didn't show up at the airport, missed a company meeting, and didn't return calls. Such behavior, they said, was uncharacteristic of him. ""There's never been a time he was out of reach,"" said Pete Tumminello, vice president of Sequent Energy, on Monday. ""I've worked with him for seven years. There's never been a time he's been out of reach."" Schantz missed a flight Friday morning with his daughter, a Tulane University senior, police said. He also did not show up for an office meeting in Houston. Schantz went to the French Quarter with friends on Thursday night, Sequent Energy spokesman Alan Chapple told CNN on Tuesday. They went there after an earlier event at Tulane University to present a $25,000 donation to the Tulane Energy Institute, Chapple said. Schantz and his colleagues had dinner with professors and students at the school, and later he and some others went to the bar. Schantz was staying at the Royal Sonesta Hotel, only about two blocks from the bar that he was seen leaving, Chapple said. Members of the party had left the establishment at varying times, he said. During their investigation, police had not discovered any evidence of a crime, Flot said Tuesday morning. The FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and private investigators were also working the case, Riley said. Schantz's son, Michael, described Monday the agony his family was feeling as they awaited news. ""My family is distraught, I'm distraught, [in] shock,"" he said. ""We just want him found alive and back with our family.""

39,"(CNN) -- Four days after Haiti's massive earthquake, efforts are under way to bury the dead as thousands of bodies crumpled in the streets of Port-au-Prince lay exposed to the sun or draped in sheets and cardboard. Throughout the city, people covered their noses from the stench and some resorted to face masks. CNN correspondents in Haiti reported efforts to remove the bodies, including the creation of a mass grave. It's still unclear how many people have been killed in Tuesday's earthquake; the prime minister suggested there could be several hundreds of thousands. CNN's Anderson Cooper, reporting Friday from a mass grave on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, described seeing hundreds of bodies mixed with garbage in open pits. Some bodies were bulldozed into the half-filled pits. ""These people will vanish,"" Cooper said in a phone report. ""No one will know what happened to them. That's one of the many horrors. ""There's no system in place here. Literally these people here are being collected off the streets, dumped into a dump truck, then brought out here and dumped in the pits,"" he said. The fear of disease is frequently the reason for rapidly burying bodies in mass graves. But contrary to popular belief, bodies do not cause epidemics after natural disasters, experts said. ""The reality is that most of the disease that live in us -- once our body is dead they can't survive very long,"" said Oliver Morgan, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fecal matter from the deceased could contaminate the water supply, posing a risk, but ""it's nowhere near the risk of all the survivors living in the streets with no sanitation,"" said Morgan, who contributed to the World Health Organization's guidelines on managing bodies after a natural disaster. There has never been an epidemic after a natural disaster that was traced to exposure to bodies, according to the WHO. The chief priority must lie with the living, experts said. ""Body collection is not the most urgent task after a natural disaster,"" according to the WHO's 2006 guidance on the Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters. ""The priority is to care for survivors. There is no significant public health risk associated with the presence of bodies. Nevertheless, bodies should be collected as soon as possible and taken away for identification."" Mass graves, it warned, are ""not justified on public health grounds. Rushing to dispose of bodies without proper identification traumatizes families and communities and may have serious legal consequences."" ""There's always talks about mass graves because that's always the easiest solution,"" said Frank Ciaccio, vice president of commercial services at Kenyon International Emergency Services, a disaster management company that responds to mass fatality accidents. ""We don't strongly recommend them. However, sometimes in situations in very developing nations, that's the only thing to do."" In cases of mass graves, teams should at least document or photograph the individual for future identification, he said. Kenyon has deployed an emergency response assessment team to Haiti. Ciaccio was part of the crew that responded to the tsunami in Southeast Asia in 2004 and New Orleans, Louisiana, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Having bodies on the street is very distressing to survivors. ""That's going to be very stressful,"" Ciaccio said. ""It's hot temperatures and that's not a pleasant sight. There's decomposed bodies. And the hotter the weather, the quicker the decomposition."" Decomposition starts as early as the day of death, bringing stench and pests. ""When you have bodies on the street that begin to decompose, you eventually get maggot infestation because of flies and you have a potential of rats,"" said Vernie Fountain, the disaster task force leader of the National Funeral Directors Association. At one of the capital city's cemeteries, people opened up old crypts and shoved corpses of quake victims into them before resealing them. Workers loaded bodies -- piled on the sides of roads -- into the basket of a front-loader tractor, which then deposited them into blood-stained dump trucks, according to CNN correspondents in Haiti. ""There's little dignity in death in Port-au-Prince these days,"" Cooper said in his report. The United States is deploying mortuary teams to identify and bury the dead in a public safety rescue mission, Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of Health and Human Services, said Thursday. After huge disasters, mortuary teams often face logistical nightmares, working with little resources, thousands of bodies, collapsed infrastructure, language barriers and different cultural and religious views. After working in the aftermath of landslides, cyclones, hurricanes and tsunamis with mass fatalities, Morgan realized the lack of a guidelines for handling the bodies was a recurring problem. ""What we often see are these pictures of mass graves which are dug three feet deep with hundreds of bodies thrown into this large hole,"" Morgan said. ""That's discouraged in preference to having a more organized situation with a long trench grave and putting bodies in an ordered way, or marked graves so people know where the victims are buried."" One possible solution is to move the bodies to a temporary, organized collection point and to gather as much information to help with future identification, said Fountain, who served as a national officer for Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team, a national response team designed to provide mortuary assistance in mass fatality incidents. After the tsunami killed 225,000 people in 2004, various Southeast Asian countries handled the dead differently based on location and available resources. While none of the countries affected by the tsunami had enough refrigerated storage to handle the corpses, many found alternatives by burying the dead in temporary, shallow graves with the intent to exhume them later. Other bodies were hastily buried within 24 hours in mass graves. ""The parallels are mass fatalities and catastrophic events,"" Ciaccio said. ""We have a significant loss of life; we have people that are unknown; we have a significant number of missing people. The one minor difference in Thailand was that it was isolated to shoreline about a mile in. Here you have total destruction of an infrastructure system.""","CNN's Anderson Cooper reported on a mass grave with hundreds of bodies .

40,"CLARENCE CENTER, New York (CNN)  -- The pilots of a commuter airliner that crashed late Thursday about 6 miles from a Buffalo, New York, airport discussed ""significant ice buildup"" on the plane's wings and windshields before the plane plunged to the ground, killing 50. Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. Continental Connection Flight 3407 was en route from Newark, New Jersey, to Buffalo Niagara International Airport when it went down about 10:20 p.m. ET Thursday. Preliminary information recovered from the flight's cockpit voice and data recorders indicated that the plane underwent ""severe"" pitching and rolling motions after the landing gear was lowered and wing flaps were set for the approach, Steve Chealander of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday afternoon. ""The crew discussed significant ice buildup, ice on the windshield and leading edge of the wings,"" Chealander said. ""The crew attempted to raise the gear and [reset] flaps shortly before the recordings ended,"" he said. iReport.com: Are you there? Let us know . The plane crashed into a home in Buffalo, killing all 49 people aboard and one person on the ground. Firefighters brought under control a blaze at the crash site on Friday, blaming a natural gas leak for the fire's persistence. Two occupants of the house survived -- a woman and her daughter -- and were released from a hospital after treatment for minor injuries, authorities said. Read about the escape . The first sign the air traffic controllers had of trouble was when Flight 3407 went off the radar. Before that, it had been business as usual. The first officer, who was the co-pilot, had no sign of stress in her voice as she talked with air traffic control. The plane was cleared for approach. About a minute later, the air traffic controller said that contact with the plane had been lost and asked whether crews in other aircraft could see anything. No one responded. The controller then said there might be a plane down. Although there was a mix of sleet and snow in the area, other planes landed safely at the airport about the time the flight went down.  Watch what weather was like when disaster happened » . The crew of a Delta flight reported rime icing, a condition in which ice quickly builds up on the leading edge of the wings.

""Almost every minute of their flight was in an ice event,"" he said. The NTSB's Chealander said the flight crew reported that visibility was about 3 miles and there was snow and mist as they descended. The voice and data recorders indicated that the plane's internal de-icing was on during the landing approach, he said.  Watch report from witness: ""All I saw was flames"" » . ""A significant ice buildup is an aerodynamic impediment,"" Chealander said. Tony Tatro was on his way home from the gym when the plane flew about 75 feet above him. The craft's nose was lower than usual, and and the left wing was tilted, he said. ""The engines didn't sound typical, didn't sound normal,"" he said.  Watch witness describe how plane went down » . The plane was loud as it came in, as if for a takeoff rather than for a landing, said David Luce, who lives 300 feet from the crash site. ""The engines sounded like they were revving at very high speed, an unnatural sound,"" Luce said. ""Then the engine cut out -- stopped. And within a couple of seconds, there was this tremendous explosion. ""It was an enormous explosion. It sounded like it hit, frankly, right in our backyard. ... The house shook; the windows shook; the ground shook,"" he said. ""It was a real blast.""  Watch Mary Jane Luce describe what she heard » .

Marvin Renslow, first officer Rebecca Shaw and flight attendants Matilda Quintero and Donna Prisco. An off-duty pilot, Capt. Joseph Zuffoletto, was also aboard. On Friday afternoon, a minister from Renslow's church in Lutz, Florida, made a statement on the family's behalf. ""They are very proud of Marvin's accomplishments as a pilot,"" said Alan Burner, associate pastor at the First Baptist Church of Lutz.

Shaw, a 25-year-old pilot from Maple Valley, Washington, had been with the airline about a year, according to her family. ""We're in shock,"" her mother, Lynn Morris, said. ""We don't understand.

41,"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- Chinese workers and army soldiers were racing to sweep snow-covered highways and unclog railway routes for millions of travelers trapped by cold weather. Souzhou, China, is blanketed by the most snow the city has had in 25 years, according to I-Reporter Susan Arthur. More than 67 million people have been affected by the weather and economic losses are expected to reach as much as $3 billion, Chinese officials say. Blizzards have snapped power lines and destroyed houses and farmland, prompting fears of food and energy shortages. Twenty-four people have died and some 827,000 people have been evacuated in 14 different provinces, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said Monday. In the past week, the snowstorms have hit the provinces in central, eastern and southern China -- places that are used to mild winters, not extreme wintry blasts. ""We've never seen such a cold weather lasting for such long a time,"" said Tang Shan, a man in his 70s in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province. ""The last time we had one here was over 50 years ago, and not this bad."" The snow and sleet have paralyzed roads, railways and airports, leaving tens of millions of travelers marooned, officials say. Many of them are bound for home ahead of the traditional Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, which falls on February 7.  Watch how the snowstorms have resulted in transit chaos » . For several days before and after that day, an estimated 178 million Chinese will travel by train, and 22 million more by plane, officials say. Millions more will take long-haul vans and buses. The Lunar New Year travel is China's busiest travel period of the year. But the cold snap is hampering travel plans. Railway and highway routes have been brought to a standstill, several regional airports have been closed and many provinces have imposed power ""brownouts"" to conserve energy. On Hunan's major highways, more than 60,000 bus riders were stranded because of icy roads. In the southern city of Guangzhou, as many as 500,000 train passengers were stranded the past few days when a power failure in neighboring Hunan province crippled the regular train services, local officials said. About 100,000 passengers  packed the square in front of the train station while others found shelter in schools and other public buildings while waiting for their trains.  Watch travelers packed shoulder to shoulder » . Even the local stock market seems affected by the nasty weather. The Shanghai composite index dropped by more than 7 percent on Monday, dragged in part by investors' concerns over the damage caused by the foul winter weather. Worst hit were transport and power stocks. Chinese premier Wen Jiabao has ordered urgent measures to unclog the transport jam and ensure a steady supply of food and energy. ""Let us mobilize urgently and work as one to wage this tough battle against the disaster,"" he said in an emergency meeting. ""Let's ensure that the people enjoy a joyful and auspicious Spring Festival."" But more miserable weather is expected. China's weather bureau Monday issued a rare ""red alert,"" warning of more severe snowstorms in the coming days. If so, the number of stranded travelers will surely swell. Tang Shan, the retired official in Hunan, is staying put instead of joining the holiday exodus. Even so, he finds the frigid weather a big nuisance. ""Hospitals now treat children who caught colds and old people who sprained bones after slipping and falling,"" he says. ""Even just walking in the icy street is perilous.""

42,"(CNN) -- Frozen winter conditions are helping slow the spread of a pipeline leak on Alaska's North Slope, an environmental official said. An estimated 46,000 gallons of a water-and-oil mixture was spilled before the source of the leak -- a pipe rupture -- was identified Monday, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC). The ruptured 18-inch line, owned by oil company BP and which usually carries a mixture of 75 percent water and 25 percent oil, has been repaired. The frozen conditions make the spill less mobile, Matthew Carr of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said late Wednesday. ""Any spill is regrettable,"" Steve Reinhart, a BP spokesman in Anchorage, told CNN. ""We will clean this up thoroughly and our investigation will find out what happened so that we can ensure this doesn't happen again."" Reinhart said the spill, which occurred entirely on land, has had no impact on production or wildlife in the area, and is contained to a small fraction of the much larger Prudhoe Bay oil field. ""It is not a pool of oil spreading out across the ground,"" Reinhart said, comparing its consistency to that of a snow cone. ""It's a partially solidified mass that's piled up in one area, and as we speak, truckloads of this material is being moved off this site and to a collection depot."" According to officials, the rupture was approximately 24 inches lengthwise, running along the bottom of the pipeline. In an incident report on its Web site Wednesday, ADEC described the rupture as being ""consistent with an overpressure scenario,"" caused by ice inside the pipe. The leak was discovered early November 29 by a BP worker conducting a routine inspection. The North Slope's biggest spill to date happened in 2006 when a corroded pipeline dumped 200,000 gallons of crude oil. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Ice buildup led to Alaskan pipeline rupture, officials say .

43,"(CNN) -- Freezing temperatures plagued much of the nation Thursday after a major storm moved into Canada, but another storm that will dump more snow in the Sierra Nevada was brewing, forecasters said. That storm, which is expected to start overnight, should last several days and eventually make its way eastward, like its predecessor, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. The Sierras, straddling California and Nevada, received more than 3 feet of snow in the last few days. Crews in El Dorado County, California, have been working around the clock this week to restore power to residents who have been left in the dark and cold since Sunday, according to CNN affiliate KXTV. That county, near Lake Tahoe, has received more than 30 inches of snow. Elsewhere, more than 18 inches of snow had accumulated in parts of the Midwest by Thursday, and high winds made the snow difficult to clear. Unusually low temperatures were in store for much of the nation into Friday, the National Weather Service said. ""Almost the entire Lower 48 is below normal as far as temperatures. In some cases, 20, 30 degrees,"" CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said. Freezing or below-freezing temperatures were recorded from Dallas, Texas, and Memphis, Tennessee, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Chicago, Illinois. The temperature in Detroit, Michigan, was 16; in Minneapolis it was minus 5; and in Chicago it was 1 degree. Overnight temperatures were to dip to 17 in Denver, Colorado, and Kansas City, Missouri; 24 in Seattle, Washington; 31 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; 32 in Las Vegas, Nevada; and 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. Lake-effect snow warnings and advisories were in effect for western Michigan and the state's Upper Peninsula, areas that border Lake Michigan, according to the National Weather Service. Lake-effect snow forms when a mass of cold air moves over a body of warmer water. iReport: Share your photos, video . Tens of thousands of people were left in the dark in southeast Michigan, with temperatures that plunged well below freezing, after high winds blew down power lines, according to CNN affiliate WXYZ TV. Schools and government offices were closed in many cities. In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Jeanne Knurr took advantage of having her two children -- Sierra, 12, and Austin, 15 -- home. ""We told them we were going to put them to work,"" she told CNN affiliate WLUK on Wednesday. ""We told them before they went to bed that they were going to have to help mom shovel because she's going to be all alone."" They didn't seem to mind. ""Well, I think shoveling snow's actually better because afterward you actually get to make forts and stuff,"" Sierra said. ""Sleeping in is a lot better."" iReport: Thousands join campus snowball fight . High winds made snow removal difficult. Wind gusts reached 50 mph in Omaha, Nebraska; 58 mph in Fort Wayne, Indiana; and 60 mph in Toledo, Ohio. In Omaha, as soon as plows cleared the snow, the wind blew more in their paths, noted former resident and CNN meteorologist Chad Myers as he watched a video clip. Several states reported storm-related deaths. In Northumberland, New York, authorities said a freight train struck a snowplow Wednesday, killing a passenger in the plow, reported CNN affiliate WTEN. In Yale, Iowa, an elderly man was discovered dead Wednesday outside his truck, said Bret Voorhees, spokesman for the state's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency. A 28-year-old woman was killed in Omaha on Tuesday night when a truck plowing snow in a parking lot backed into her, police spokesman Jacob Bettin said. She was pronounced dead at the scene. In northern Arizona, dozens of elk hunters were stranded this week by deep snow in the area's backwoods. The Coconino County Sheriff's Office said it has assisted or offered assistance to about 50 hunters Wednesday and Thursday, including some air evacuations. The Arizona Game and Fish Department also has been providing flyovers by helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft as rescue crews search for hunting parties and campsites, the sheriff's office said. Brady Smith, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, said hunters were warned of the possibility of getting snowed in earlier in the week. The city of Flagstaff, the county seat, received at least 30 inches of snow. The elk hunt ends Thursday.

44,"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- China's worst winter in more than half a century showed no signs of abating Wednesday as forecasters warned of three more days of snow and sleet. Stranded passengers wait to get into the railway station at Wuhan in central China's Hubei province . The weather has paralyzed transportation, frozen the power grid and delivered a $4.5 billion hit to the economy, according to figures released Wednesday by the Civil Affairs Ministry. The situation is compounding economic problems for China. Destroyed crops have resulted in increased food prices, while the inability to transport goods has further inflated prices and led to shortages at stores. China's railways and roads are the lifeblood for its manufacturing sector, one of the fastest growing in the world. ""Being a manufacturer, we are so worried,"" said marketing manager Calvina Chan, who works for a Hong Kong-based firm that relies on a factory in mainland China to produce luggage for brands such as Samsonite. ""Because of the snowstorm, the transportation isn't very good and so there might be a late delivery."" Automakers Toyota and Ford halted their China-based production this week. The transportation stoppage has had a domino effect, preventing the delivery of coal, which is vital to China's power plants. That is amplifying China's energy problems. ""Most of the coal is produced in the north and northeast, (while) the users are along the coast,"" said economist Nicholas Kwan. ""This time the snowstorm's problem is not so much freezing the production but freezing the transportation line which makes transportation of coal to those power plants more difficult."" Kwan said some of the power plants have already depleted their coal reserves. All this comes during the Lunar New Year holiday, the country's busiest shopping season. In Guangzhou, hundreds of factory workers who had saved money all year to visit their families during China's Lunar New Year filled the city's train station, waiting for trains that were not expected to arrive for days. Up to half a million people have camped out in the southern city for nearly a week, hoping to get home for the holiday. Factories in the province of Guangzhou shut down Wednesday ahead of the February 7 holiday with workers joining the masses around the train station -- hoping the government would deliver on its promise of quick action and immediate relief for those trying to make it home. ""I have been sleeping out here for six days. I have spent all my money. I don't know how I will get home,"" one man said. Another man told CNN's Hugh Riminton he had tried to get out of Guangzhou every way possible -- by airplane, bus and his own car -- but could not make it because of the weather conditions. ""Now he's in the queue with everyone else trying to get on a train,"" Riminton said. ""And the trains simply aren't going at the moment and it's unlikely they'll be going really in sufficient numbers for days to come"" Security is tight at the railway station as people occasionally stampeded the barricade in an attempt to get closer to the train platforms, to no avail. Armed riot police entered the station on Wednesday to regain control of the situation. So far, Chinese authorities have managed to persuade nearly 470,000 people to abandon their travel plans and accept a refund for their train tickets. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao apologized Tuesday to the hundreds of thousands of people stranded in train stations across his country -- a rare move by a Chinese politician. ""First we'll fix the electric grid. After that, the trains will run again. ... Then all of you can go home for the Chinese New Year,"" the premier said. President Hu Jintao called an emergency meeting of the policy-making politburo and vowed a quick government response. More than 177 million Chinese were expected to travel by train, and 22 million more by plane, for Chinese Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival. ""Going home every year is an obligation,"" one Chinese woman explained. ""It is family reunion, and no matter how difficult it is, we have to do it."" Brian Blackwell of Chicago was stranded for two days at Shanghai's Hongqiao International Airport. ""There were thousands of people there and they were pushing toward the counter. You had no idea what the status of your flight was."" Brutal winter weather has pounded China's central, eastern and southern sections. In its 10-day forecast, the China Meteorological Administration said Wednesday that southwestern, eastern and southern China can expect more snow and sleet with freezing temperatures, while northern China will stay clear but windy. The winter precipitation had caused at least 49 deaths due to collapsed roofs and treacherous travel conditions, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and local officials said. Nearly a million police have been dispatched to help keep roadways open as thousands of vehicles have become stranded in the snow and ice, according to Chinese Ministry of Public Safety spokesman Wu Heping.

45,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The death of a 14-year-old girl in England after she received a vaccination for Human Papilloma virus (HPV) has prompted a widespread freeze on the country's national vaccination program. Millions of girls have received vaccinations for HPV since 2008, the virus that causes 99 percent of cervical cancers. More than 1.4 million girls have received the vaccination in England since the National Health Service (NHS) started administering it in September 2008. Natalie Morton's sudden death Monday occurred within hours after she received a shot of the vaccine Cervarix at the NHS at her school in  Coventry. Three other girls at the Blue Coat Church of England school suffered mild symptoms of dizziness and nausea after receiving the vaccine, according to media reports. It remains unclear if the vaccine caused Morton's death. Only an autopsy will be able to determine the exactly cause of death. Glaxo Smith Kline, the manufacturer of Cervarix, issued a recall of the batch of vaccine used in Coventry as a ""precautionary measure.""  Watch reaction to Natalie Morton's death » . ""At this stage the cause of this tragic death is unknown,"" the company said in a statement posted on their Web site. ""Following immediate quarantine of the batch involved last night, we have taken the decision to voluntarily recall this batch as a further precautionary measure while the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Natalie's death is conducted."" On Tuesday several NHS clinics and schools indefinitely postponed immunizations. ""As a purely precautionary measure, we have asked the NHS to quarantine all stocks of HPV vaccine from the batch related to this case,"" a spokesperson for the NHS said. ""Where the local NHS has supplies of vaccine from other production batches, they should continue with the vaccination program."" Many clinics were forced to close as they checked the numbers on their batches of the vaccine. What is HPV? HPV stands for human Papilloma virus. Although there are more than 100 types of HPV, only a few of them are known to cause cervical cancer. Most strains of HPV are harmless or cause genital warts. HPV is a common sexually-transmitted disease. Almost half of all women who have sex will be infected at one point in their life, according to the British National Health Service. HPV infects the cells of the surface of the cervix. Infections can clear up on their own or stay for many years without any symptoms and develop into cervical cancer. Ninety-nine percent of cervical cancers are caused by HPV. What is the Cervarix HPV vaccine? The Cervarix HPV vaccine protects against the two strains of HPV (16 and 18) that cause cervical cancer in over 70 percent of women. The vaccine is typically injected in the upper arm, or thigh, in three doses within six months, and is recommended for teenage girls. How effective is the Cervarix vaccine? According to the manufacturer, Glaxo Smith Kline, Cervarix is over 99 percent effective. Is Cervarix the most common vaccine for HPV? No. Gardisil, manufactured by Merck is used by the majority of vaccine programs worldwide. Gardisil protects against four strains of HPV (16, 18, 6 and 11). Strains 6 and 11 cause less serious conditions, such as genital warts. Gardisil proved comparatively effective in trials carried out by Merck. Of 23 million American girls who have already been vaccinated, 32 deaths were reported, though the reports do not determine if the deaths were caused by the vaccine or just a coincidence. Why was Cervarix chosen for the UK? According to the NHS, Cervarix, ""was selected because the bid from this company scored higher than the competitor in the adjudication process against pre-agreed award criteria. The pre-agreed award criteria were shared with the manufacturers during the process so that they were fully informed of the criteria against which their bids would be evaluated."" When was the vaccine introduced? In September 2008, England began a national program to vaccinate girls aged 12-13, and a three-year catch up campaign offering the vaccine to 13-18 year old girls. Do condoms protect against HPV? Using condoms reduces the risk of HPV transmission, but infection is still possible because HPV can be spread by contact with parts of the body that the condom does not cover. What are the known dangers associated with taking the HPV vaccine? Cervarix has undergone rigorous safety testing as part of the licensing process required in the UK and other European countries, according to the NHS. The most commonly reported side effects are mild swelling or pain at the injection site, nausea, a mild temperature, dizziness, diarrhea and muscle aches. In rare cases allergic reactions in the form of skin rashes and in very rare cases anaphylactic shock has occurred.","Teenage girl dies after receiving Cervarix vaccination for HPV .

46,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The death toll has risen to 33 in Friday's twin blasts in Karachi, authorities said Saturday. One blast targeted a bus filled with Shiite religious observers, killing scores. Another explosion in front of a hospital where attack victims were being treated, a government official said. Along with the the deaths from both blasts, more than 160 people were injured, the government official said. Motorcycles were used in both assaults, police said, and they came during the Shiite observance of Arbaeen, which takes place 40 days after the anniversary of Iman Hussein's death, also known as Ashura. Along with the fatalities, 69 people were injured in the first blast, said Dr. Saghir Ahmed, Sindh provincial health minister. The second blast happened in front of the emergency room at Jinnah Hospital, where doctors treated people from the first attack and others on stretchers were waiting to be taken to the crowded facility. Along with the 13 killed, 92 were injured. The last deadly blast in Karachi was in late December during Ashura, when more than 40 people were killed. -- CNN's Nasir Habib contributed to this report .","The first explosion targeted Shiite religious observers on a bus .

47,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- An evacuation order was lifted Wednesday morning for more than 500 California homes on hillsides vulnerable to mudslides, authorities said. With the sun shining over much of Los Angeles, officials told people who live in the foothill areas of La Crescenta, La Canada Flintridge and Acton that they could return to their homes at 8 a.m. PT (11 a.m. ET). Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for those residents Tuesday morning as a precaution when heavy rains were predicted. The dangerous mudslides did not develop, but this area was especially hit hard after a downpour Saturday unleashed a river of mud that damaged dozens of homes. Several of the homes were declared uninhabitable. A massive wildfire in the Angeles National Forest last summer burned hillsides where these homes are located.","NEW: People in 500 homes in Los Angeles foothill areas can return .

48,"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- Her braids, dusty from the rubble around her, poked out from the small opening where she lay crying in pain, her right leg pinned under a heavy piece of metal. A group of men worked throughout the day to free this 11-year-old girl -- one of scores trapped beneath buildings that collapsed in Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude quake. Lacking proper supplies to cut through the metal crushing the child's leg, the men briefly considered amputating it. Finally, just after sunset Thursday, a miracle of sorts: an electric saw and a small generator. Within a couple of hours, the girl was freed and rushed to a first aid station. Her leg was so badly wounded, her family was taking her to a more sophisticated hospital some three hours outside of Port-au-Prince. Many rescuers have clawed their way to survivors pinned beneath buildings two days after the devastating earthquake. In the absence of heavy machinery to clear the debris, residents used their hands and brawn to lift large slabs of concrete. Some trapped victims punched out bricks themselves and tried to squeeze through cracks in the fallen structures. Atop the mound of debris that once was a five-story building of great prominence, U.S. rescue workers Thursday pulled out a man in a deep green uniform. Tarmo Joveer, an Estonian security officer for the United Nations, free from the enclosure, stood up and raised his fist. He had been trapped beneath the rubble of his workplace for two days following the quake that shook the city and toppled the U.N. headquarters around him. He said he had never lost hope. He was one of scores of U.N. workers feared trapped inside the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping and civilian assistance mission, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said Thursday. As many as 150 staff members were still missing after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake rocked Haiti Tuesday afternoon, devastating it's capital. The ""small miracle,"" as Ban described it, is one of many throughout the disaster area as rescuers and residents scramble to free entrapped survivors. The Fairfax County, Virginia, Urban Search and Rescue Team saved Joveer, who was fed water through a rubber pipe when they discovered he was trapped beneath four meters of rubble, according to Ban. After Joveer emerged, he walked away, brushing the dust out of his hair with his hand and hugging those around him. ""It was not good,"" is all he could say to describe his experience under the rubble. He also said he did not think there was anyone else alive. Joveer was later taken to an Argentinean hospital, Ban said. Joveer said during the earthquake he lost his footing, fell and suffered some pain. He did not talk further about any injuries he may have sustained. It took about five hours to rescue Joveer, Fairfax rescue member Sam Gray said, adding that the disaster was the worst he'd seen. ""Obviously, it was pretty nice to find somebody that we were able to help,"" Gray said. ""Unfortunately, we couldn't get to everybody but we're going to keep trying and keep working while we're here. This is the first of many people that we're going to help over the next couple of weeks."" Earlier Thursday, residents conducted their own mission and spent three hours digging out Philip Jean Renol from his home. He suffered a broken leg and two broken arms. At a school house, a group of men had been working since Wednesday to dig out a man from beneath what was left of the five-story building. They worked in assembly-line fashion with some tapping away with chisels and one operating a blow torch to melt away parts of the concrete debris crushing the victim. With his right shoulder pinned and his hand trapped, his screams could be heard as the men desperately labored to free him. Finally, he emerged from beneath the destroyed school alive when two men lifted his concrete-dusted body Thursday. From inside the school other voices were heard. Children and teachers are believed to be trapped inside. Throughout the day, ongoing rescue attempts were taking place all over Port-au-Prince, many with outcomes as yet unknown. A search-and-rescue crew of American, Chilean and French members found a woman trapped at the Hotel Montana in Petionville, just outside Port-au-Prince. Officer David Barlow of the Fairfax team told CNN the crew was trying to reach the woman from two different points. The victim, who was a guest at the hotel, was stuck in the bar area of the five-story hotel that had collapsed into a 30-foot-tall pile. France has expressed concern for the approximately 200 French tourists who were staying at the Hotel Montana. Three French girls trapped in rubble had only one French firefighter digging for them, reflective of a severe need for rescue workers and equipment. In another location in Port-au-Prince, two people were pulled from the ruins of the Caribbean Market by the Icelandic International Search and Rescue Team, Iceland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced. But another woman, Nadia, was still entombed inside the four-level market place. She has not had water for almost 48 hours and has told rescuers she feels tired. Rescuers said they had yet to devise a plan to extract her safely. Near the presidential palace, residents dug for hours Wednesday to rescue a 13-year-old girl named Bea. A wild cheer erupted as she was pulled out alive. But nearby lay the bodies of four of her family members. Haitians and rescuers are rushing in the hope that more survivors can be pulled out alive from beneath the multitude of wreckage sites, but some have accepted that some will perish waiting for help. ""Honestly, it's an incredible amount of devastation and an incredible amount of people that will probably lose their lives here,"" Gray said. ""The hardest part is to know how many people that aren't going to be saved.""

49,"(CNN) -- The stepdaughter of Jesse Browning, the star of a reality show about loggers, was attacked and killed by the family's dog in Astoria, Oregon, an investigator said. Her mother found 4-year-old Ashlynn Anderson in the yard of their home after the attack Sunday afternoon, Clatsop County Sheriff Chief Deputy Paul Williams said Tuesday. The child was pronounced dead on arrival after she was flown by helicopter to a Portland hospital, Williams said. The family's two Rottweilers were placed in quarantine, he said. The dog believed to have bitten the child was 2½ years old, he added. Ashlynn's stepfather, Jesse Browning, is a logger who appears on the reality show the History Channel describes as a series about ""the treacherous life of Pacific Northwest timber cutters.""","""Ax Men"" star Jesse Browning's stepdaughter was attacked, killed by dog .

50,"(CNN) -- The magnitude-8.8 earthquake that rocked the west coast of Chile last month was violent enough to move the city of Concepcion at least 10 feet to the west and the capital, Santiago, about 11 inches to the west-southwest, researchers said. The quake also shifted other parts of South America, as far apart as the Falkland Islands and Fortaleza, Brazil. The results were reached via global positioning satellite measurements taken before and after the February 27 quake by teams from The Ohio State University, the University of Hawaii, the University of Memphis and the California Institute of Technology, as well as agencies across South America. NASA scientists have also credited the quake with shifting the Earth's axis enough to create shorter days. The change is negligible, but still worth noting: Each day should be 1.26 microseconds shorter, according to preliminary calculations. A microsecond is one-millionth of a second. A large quake -- like the one that hit Chile's Maule region -- shifts massive amounts of rock and alters the distribution of mass on the planet. When that distribution changes, it changes the rate at which the planet rotates. And the rotation rate determines the length of a day. ""Any worldly event that involves the movement of mass affects the Earth's rotation,"" Benjamin Fong Chao, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said while explaining the phenomenon in 2005. Despite the tragedy of the earthquake, which killed hundreds of Chileans, scientists see opportunities to gain valuable information in the aftermath. ""The Maule earthquake will arguably become one of the, if not the most important, great earthquakes yet studied,"" said Ben Brooks of the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the University of Hawaii. ""We now have modern, precise instruments to evaluate this event.""","Earthquake also shifted other parts of South America .

51,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Thirty-six people were killed and dozens were injured in explosions at a market in Lahore, Pakistan, on Monday, an official said. Rizwan Naseer, chief of Lahore's rescue service, also said 109 people were wounded. The explosions did not appear to be a suicide attack but could instead have been bombs detonated by remote control, Punjab Police Chief Tariq Salim said. The nation's state-run news agency, Associated Press of Pakistan, said the blasts were the result of ""bomb explosions."" The explosions occurred at Moon Market in the Iqbal Town neighborhood, the news agency said. It cited Iqbal Town Division's Ali Nasir Rizvi as saying most of the victims were women. Khusro Pervaiz, a senior government official in Lahore, said in a television interview that 60 people had been taken to five Lahore hospitals. The blasts happened around 8:45 p.m. at the popular market, said Rai Nazar Hayat, a spokesman for Lahore police. Earlier, ten people were killed -- including two police officers -- when a suicide bomber detonated outside a district courthouse in Peshawar on Monday, officials said. At least 36 were injured, six of them seriously, said Dr. Hameed Afridi, CEO of the Lady Reading Hospital. The bomber got out of a rickshaw and detonated himself, according to witnesses. The attacker was wearing a suicide jacket with about 6 kilograms of explosives, said Shafqat Malik, head of the North West Frontier Province bomb disposal unit. Peshawar is the capital of the Northwest Frontier Province, where the Pakistani government waged a recent military offense against Taliban militants. Meanwhile, five people were hurt in a bomb attack in Quetta on Monday morning, said Jamil Kakar, a Quetta police official. The explosives were placed in a car and destroyed two other cars and three motorbikes. The courthouse attack comes three days after four militants armed with guns and grenades stormed a mosque in Rawalpindi frequented by military personnel. At least 36 were killed and 75 wounded. Among the dead were 17 children, according to military officials. Also killed were an army general and eight other military officials, six of senior rank. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan reiterated its claim in an e-mail to CNN the next day, after media outlets quoted officials who doubted the group's participation. ""We reconfirmed it, that the TTP has done it and will do more which are already planned,"" the group said in the e-mail. ""We once again mention that we are not against the innocent people and the state of Pakistan but against those officers and ministers who are American by hearts and minds and Pakistani just by faces.""

52,"(CNN) -- Authorities are investigating six possible cases of bacterial meningitis -- including two deaths -- in rural Oklahoma elementary school students. The Rogers County Health Department and Oklahoma State Department of Health said two children from Oologah-Talala public school district have died from the disease. One of them was an 8-year-old, said Superintendent Rick Thomas. Thomas said school was canceled Friday for the district. ""We just feel like we would rather err on the side of caution,"" he said, although he has urged parents to remain calm. The state health board said it was providing antibiotics to the schools to help prevent the spread of meningococcal disease -- caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis -- which can appear as pneumonia, septicemia or meningitis. Meningitis is a disease caused by the inflammation of the meninges, the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A medical team at Oologah Lower Elementary School screened more than 100 people including faculty, CNN affiliate KOTV reported. Authorities said the team is offering antibiotics to other students and faculty in the district, and there is enough medication for about 1,000 people, the affiliate reported. Last year, 16 cases of meningococcal disease were reported in Oklahoma and one person died, the board said. Symptoms of meningococcal disease may appear two to 10 days after infection, but typically within three to four days, the state board said. People ill with meningococcal septicemia may have fever, nausea, vomiting and a rash, it said. Those with meningitis will have fever, intense headache, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck. ""It is important to seek care from a physician as soon as possible if these symptoms appear,"" the board said. Oologah is about 30 miles northeast of Tulsa.","Students from Oologah-Talala public school district in rural Oklahoma .

53,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Another strong earthquake rocked Indonesia early Thursday as the Southeast Asian nation was reeling from an earlier jolt that killed more than 200 people. A resident stands next to building that collapsed onto a car in Padang, Indonesia, on Wednesday. The 6.8 magnitude quake Thursday hit southern Sumatra at 8:52 a.m. local time (0152 GMT), the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. Wednesday's earlier quake was 7.6 magnitude. At least 236 people are dead and more than 500 injured, the Indonesian Social Ministry's Crisis Center said Thursday. It said it had little information on the missing and feared the death toll would climb into the thousands. The second quake was on a smaller scale than the first, said meteorology official Fauzi, who uses only one name. There were no damage reports yet. Indonesian Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari expected ""the casualties and the damage of this earthquake to be bigger than the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake, given the intensity and the spread of the damage."" The magnitude-6.3 Yogyakarta quake in central Java in May 2006 killed more than 5,000 people, triggered fears of an eruption of a nearby volcano and caused significant damage to a 9th century Prambanan temple. Thousands may be trapped by collapsed buildings and houses, Rustam Pakaya, the head of the Health Ministry's crisis center, told CNN on Wednesday. State-run Antara news agency cited Pakaya as saying he had received reports that part of a hospital had collapsed and that people were buried under the debris. The temblor struck around 5 p.m., about 33 miles (53 kilometers) from Padang, the capital city of West Sumatra and home to more than 800,000 people. The quake caused widespread power and phone outages, making it difficult to assess damage. Aid agencies kicked into gear to help those in need. ""We had aid ready because this area of Indonesia is susceptible to this type of tragedy,"" said Jane Cocking, humanitarian director for Oxfam. ""Communications with the quake-zone are difficult and we are hoping for the best but having to plan for the worst."" ""The situation is quite devastating,"" said Amelia Merrick, the operations director for World Vision Indonesia. ""Bridges have gone down, phone lines are in total disrepair. It's difficult for us to assess the situation,"" she said. The organization had said it would send assessment teams to the area Thursday morning. ""We know there's no electricity tonight... many of the families will be spending the night outdoors, in pitch black. I'm very afraid of what might happen next,"" she said, referring to the possibility of aftershocks. Hundreds of houses have been damaged, Wayne Ulrich, the Red Cross disaster management coordinator in Indonesia, told CNN. ""We do not know the [exact] numbers."" ""We have concerns that a hospital has been partially damaged, a market has caught on fire, the airport was closed down for inspection because of the fear if they landed any planes,"" it might cause problems, Ulrich said.  Watch Ulrich discuss the rescue efforts » . Access to the affected areas was obstructed in parts, he added. It's ""blocked by all kinds of problems: frightened people out in the streets, cars, and people trying to get out of the city."" The earthquake was felt in nearby cities, such as Medan and Bengkulu, where people panicked and ran outside in search of higher ground, fearing a tsunami. But it was also felt as far away as Singapore and Malaysia. ""I did feel the tremor in office today somewhere between 5 - 6 p.m.,"" said Ratna Osman, who works in a single-story office building in Petaling Jaya, just outside Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur. ""I asked [a co-worker] if there's an earthquake somewhere -- either that or I was hallucinating."" ""At first, I thought the chair I was sitting on had a screw loose or something,"" Osman said. The region is accustomed to earthquakes, and locals have been taught to identify safe places in case of a tsunami, according to Sean Granville-Ross, the Mercy Corps country director for Indonesia. ""We hope that preparation is now paying off,"" he said. But if many homes have been destroyed, people may be spending the night with no shelter, he said. Earlier this month, an earthquake in West Java killed 57 people. Several buildings were damaged, Metro TV reported, and people were seen running out of their homes and toward the hills. One employee of a private company in Jalan Ahmad Yani, told Antara news agency that ""everybody panicked with some shouting 'earthquake.'"" TVOne pictures from the scene showed people milling around outside in the city. Phone lines were apparently down in many parts of Padang. Indonesia's Tempo Interactive, a media outlet based in Jakarta, had trouble reaching its correspondent in the West Sumatra city, according to journalist Purwani Diyah Prabandari. ""I hope it's just the cell phone connection,"" Prabandari told CNN. Indonesians trying to find out more about the quake flooded the Internet, including Twitter. Some expressed concern for relatives and friends in Padang. ""Dear God, please send down your angels to hug and protect my grandpa in Padang,"" said one Twitter post. The Web site for one of Indonesia's main newspapers, The Jakarta Globe, crashed for a while, partly as a result of the heavy traffic from people trying to find out about the quake, the paper said in a Twitter post. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a tsunami watch for Indonesia, India, Thailand and Malaysia, but canceled it soon after. The temblor did generate a tsunami just under one foot high, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. On Tuesday, a magnitude 8.0 quake-triggered tsunami killed at least 111 people in the Samoan islands and Tonga. Read latest news on the Samoa quake and tsunami . The tsunami waves swept across a wide swath of the Pacific Ocean, killing dozens and flattening or submerging villages. The dead included 22 in American Samoa, 82 in Samoa and seven in Tonga. Officials warned that the death toll could rise as rescue workers start to reach outlying villages and discover new casualties. The U.S. Geological Survey declined to say whether the two quakes were linked. ""The simple answer is we can't speculate on a connection,"" Carrieann Bedwell of the USGS told CNN. ""Both are in highly seismic areas."" The epicenters of the two temblors are about 4,700 miles (7,600 km) apart.

54,"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- Long lines formed under the watchful eye of American and multinational troops as a wide-scale food distribution effort reached capacity Thursday in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Nearly 160,000 Haitian women each collected a 25-kilogram (55 pounds) bag of rice under a distribution plan coordinated by the United Nations, several private humanitarian agencies and the Haitian government. The effort was launched Sunday but not all 16 fixed distribution points around the capital were operational until Thursday. So far, 600,000 people affected by the devastating January 12 earthquake have been able to collect food under this plan, said Marcus Prior, spokesman for the United Nations World Food Programme. ""We're encouraged by the way the system is working to get food out into the city to those in need, but still have a long way to go,"" Prior said. Only women were given food coupons beforehand and allowed to stand in line to collect for their families. ""Our long experience in food distribution tells us that by delivering food into the hands of women, it is more likely to be redistributed equitably among the household -- including the men,"" Prior said. U.S. and U.N. troops have been keeping strict control over the crowds. Prior said the distribution plan has been orderly so far. The death toll from the earthquake has reached 212,000, Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said Thursday. More than 300,000 people were injured and more than 1 million were made homeless, he told CNN's ""Larry King Live.""","United Nations, humanitarian agencies, Haitian government sponsor program .

55,"(CNN) -- Two men died Saturday morning when their pickup collided head-on with one of Trace Adkins' tour buses north of Shreveport, Louisiana. Adkins was not on the bus, but five members of his band and crew suffered minor injuries, the country music singer's Web site said. The bus was en route to Bossier City for a show at the CenturyTel Center. Adkins had already arrived at the venue when he heard the news, according to his Web site. ""This is a real tragedy,"" Adkins said in a statement. ""Two people have been killed and I don't even know their names. So out of respect for their families, I prefer not to comment too much at this time."" Adkins said he would perform a scaled-down acoustic set at Saturday's show, which also featured singer Martina McBride. He will sit out a show in Pensacola, Florida, on Sunday. Adkins began his music career more than a decade ago with a platinum-selling debut, and has released nine albums since then. In 2008, he appeared on NBC's ""The Celebrity Apprentice,"" and last year, ventured into the world of comic books with the launch of the four-part ""Luke McBain,"" based on his likeness and persona.

56,"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- The death toll from heavy floods and mudslides in Mexico increased Tuesday to 41, a government agency announced. Most of the deaths -- 30 -- have occurred in eastern Michoacan state, on the central Pacific coast. The state attorney general's office released a list of the deceased Tuesday. Another 12 people are missing after mudslides from two large hills, Michoacan Gov. Leonel Godoy said Tuesday. The remaining 11 deaths resulted from a mudslide Saturday near the small town of Temascaltepec in neighboring Mexico state. Interior Secretary Fernando Francisco Gomez Mont has declared a state of natural disaster for the Michoacan cities of Angangueo, Ocampo, Tiquicheo de Nicolas Romero, Tuxpan and Tuzantla. The declaration makes those cities eligible for money from the federal natural disaster fund. The death toll in Michoacan had been 27 until three additional bodies were discovered Tuesday. Godoy said officials are focusing on three tasks: searching for anyone who is alive, recovering bodies and removing boulders and downed trees. Officials are under pressure to act quickly, he said, because another cold front with more possible rain is expected within the next few days. More than 3,500 Michoacan residents are homeless, the state government said on its Web site. In addition to Michoacan and Mexico states, unusually heavy rain in the past week also flooded parts of Mexico City, the nation's capital. Up to 37,000 people nationwide have been affected, government officials said. On Sunday, Mexican President Felipe Calderon toured Valle de Chalco, another city in Mexico state on the eastern outskirts of the Mexico City metro area. National Water Commission Director Jose Luis Luege said Tuesday that contaminated water from a sewage network there that overflowed Friday will continue to flood the town for at least another 48 hours. The break in the sewage pipe had been fixed, but it burst again. Officials also built two dikes to contain the sewage but were unable to use them out of concern that they would burst under the intense pressure from the floodwaters, Luege said. ""It's a very complicated operation,"" he said. More than 3,000 homes in Valle de Chalco were flooded.

57,"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- An explosion Saturday at an eatery in the western Indian city of Pune killed at least nine people and injured 33 others, authorities said. ""It appears to be a bomb blast, and bombs obviously are related to terrorism,"" said U.K. Bansal, special secretary for security in India's Interior Ministry. Four of the dead were not from India, he told CNN. Home Secretary G.K. Pillai told reporters that the explosives were packed in a bag noticed by a waiter at the popular eatery called the German Bakery. The explosion occurred about 7:30 p.m. local time Saturday. Rajendra Sonawane, joint police commissioner for the city, said the blast struck the German Bakery in Pune's Koregaon Park, sister network CNN-IBN reported. Initially, authorities thought a cooking gas cylinder had exploded at the bakery, but all cylinders were accounted for, according to CNN-IBN. An anti-terrorism squad is assisting in the investigation, Chandra Iyengar, home secretary for Maharashtra state, told CNN. However, he wouldn't confirm the blast as a terrorist attack. The German Bakery is frequented by tourists. It's near the Osho Ashram, a commune founded by the late Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, who returned to India from the United States in the 1980s. CNN's Harmeet Singh contributed to this report.","NEW: Explosives packed in bag noticed by waiter, home secretary says .

58,"(CNN) -- The Icelandic volcano producing the ash cloud snarling much of European air traffic has not stopped erupting. Is there any chance that flight schedules could return to normal any time soon, and does the weather forecast provide any relief? Here are some common questions and answers about the ash cloud crisis. Q: For how long will the volcanic cloud remain in the atmosphere? A: The very fine ash previously injected into higher levels of the atmosphere -- above 20,000 feet -- will remain in the air for ""quite some time,"" because the particles can be removed only by thunderstorms, which are not expected in the next few days, the World Meteorological Organization said Tuesday. The current high pressure system, with weak winds and slowly descending air in the center, is not helping to disperse the ash cloud, the WMO said. Still, the ash particles are slowly descending to lower levels, and there is evidence that most of the ash is now between the ground and about 10,000 feet, the WMO said. Q: What does the weather forecast say? A: The current high-pressure system over Iceland is expected to dissipate toward the end of the week, when a stronger low-pressure system is predicted to develop, the WMO said. Not only will this system change the winds and push the ash toward the Arctic, but the rains associated with this system will help ""wash out"" the ash at lower levels, the WMO said. While that directly affects only the ash in Iceland, it could be good news for the rest of Europe, because some of the ash could be ""washed out"" of the air before it reaches the continent, said CNN weather anchor Mari Ramos. For Ireland and the United Kingdom, upper-level winds coming from the north are not predicted to change any time soon. Any rain that does develop closer to Europe would be unlikely to help wash much of the ash out of the atmosphere, Ramos said, because the ash cloud has generally remained above any weather system. The ash currently being spewed out by the volcano is reaching as high as 20,000 feet. Q: If the weather isn't going to change, when might the volcano stop erupting? A: The eruption will continue for a while, but the activity will become less and less explosive, said volcanologist Simon Day of University College London. The more important question is how long the volcano will continue to send ash high into the atmosphere. ""With the first phases, the ash was going up to 30,000 to 40,000 feet,"" Day said. ""The current levels that the ash is being ejected to is maybe only 10,000 or 20,000 feet. It's probably also coarser-grained ash as well -- it's not quite so finely divided on the whole -- so it's going to settle out faster. So although the eruption may continue for a long time, and we may over the next few months see bursts of explosive activity, it's probably not going to be as much of a problem as it has been during this last week."" Q: Does the appearance of the volcano's plume indicate anything about the ash? A: The whiteness of the plume suggests it contains mainly steam and little ash, the WMO said. When under-glacier eruptions occur, like this one in Iceland, the volcanoes tend to produce finer particles of ash, which stay in the air longer, Day said. That's because the melting ice shatters the magma, which contains the particles that eventually become ash. Q: What do the ash particles look like? A: The particles are extremely fine -- about as fine as pollen, Day said. They are made up of rocks, minerals, and volcanic glass, which together form volcanic ash, the WMO said. Such ash is hard, does not dissolve in water, and is extremely abrasive and mildly corrosive, the WMO said. Q: Iceland has many volcanoes, so why hasn't this situation happened before? A: The last time an Icelandic volcano produced so much ash over Europe was in 1947, when the Hekla volcano erupted -- but that was when there were fewer planes in the sky and the world wasn't as dependent on air travel as it is now, Day said. Disruption to air travel as a result of volcanoes happens frequently in the northern Pacific, along the Alaska-to-Japan route, where four to five days a year ash levels force flights to be diverted, Day said. But airlines can more easily divert their routes there than they can in Europe.","Meteorologists: very fine ash in upper atmosphere will remain for ""quite some time""

59,"(CNN) -- The Winter Olympics has been hit by tragedy after the death of a Georgian competitor following a crash during training for the high-speed luge event -- the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Georgian Embassy have confirmed. Nodar Kumaritashvili, 21, was on the final corner of the course during official training when he had a ""serious crash"" and was propelled off the track at the  Whistler Sliding Center in Vancouver, Canada, according to the IOC. ""Our first thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of the athlete. The whole Olympic Family is struck by this tragedy, which clearly casts a shadow over these Games"", IOC President Jacques Rogge said in a statement. ""We are deeply struck by this tragedy and join the IOC in extending our condolences to the family, friends and teammates of this athlete, who came to Vancouver to follow his Olympic dream"", added John Furlong of VANOC, the Games Organizing Committee. In the same statement, International Luge Federation President Josef Fendt said: ""This is a terrible accident. ""This is the gravest thing that can happen in sport, and our thoughts and those of the 'luge family', are naturally with those touched by this event."" The luge event is one of the most dangerous in sport, with competitors sliding down an icy track on a sledge, while steering with their legs, at speeds approaching 100 miles per hour. Kumaritashvili was not considered one of the favorites to win a medal and was ranked 44th in the world. However, earlier in practice, gold medal favorite Armin Zoggeler of Italy also lost control and crashed on curve 11, although he was able to walk away from the incident.

60,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Early-morning commuters in much of the Deep South, braced for the possibility of a second round of snow and ice, had an easier-than-expected ride Monday as warmer temperatures kept winter weather at bay. Most winter weather advisories and warnings were canceled early Monday except for portions of northern Alabama and Georgia at higher elevations. However, the advisories and warnings stretched into Ohio and Pennsylvania. Forecasters had warned of an additional 1 to 3 inches of snow accumulation in the South on Sunday night into Monday morning. The Deep South had up to 6 inches of snow in some areas Friday. But ""the accumulating snow that was in last night's forecast isn't going to happen,"" CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said Monday. ""It is now too warm."" As of 5:30 a.m. ET, the temperature in Atlanta was 41 degrees, well above the freezing mark, and rain was falling. Forecasters initially had expected the rain to turn into snow after 1 a.m. Monday. Snow flurries are forecast later Monday as an Arctic front moves through, Morris said, but no accumulation was expected outside mountainous areas. The weather will be ""not nearly as bad as what was forecast,"" CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said. Hundreds of flights were canceled out of Atlanta in anticipation of the newest round of winter weather. Delta Air Lines said Sunday that it was canceling 400 flights from early morning through noon Monday, the majority in the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. AirTran Airways canceled 48 flights scheduled to depart or arrive in Atlanta between 8 and 10 a.m. Monday, and a spokesman said more cancellations were possible. Beleaguered states in the mid-Atlantic region also may catch a break from the heavy snowfall initially predicted. A snow emergency set to take effect Monday morning in Washington will not happen. The National Weather Service was forecasting a slight chance of snow before noon, then a mix of rain and snow, with an above-freezing high of 36 degrees. The area already has shoveled itself out of a season record snowfall of 55.9 inches, according to preliminary National Weather Service estimates. iReport: Share your pictures and videos . Slick conditions in Kansas on Sunday caused at least two massive pileups, one of which involved as many as 30 vehicles. Video showed cars, vans and trucks sandwiched on a small bridge, with emergency workers climbing over vehicles to reach the injured. The extent of injuries was not immediately known. Portions of Interstates 70 and 35 were closed for hours, according to the Kansas Department of Transportation. Drivers involved in the I-70 pileup described poor visibility conditions to CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City, Missouri. ""It happened too fast,"" said motorist Sam Skramstad, who was driving home to Colorado. ""It was just there and I headed for the guardrail and it didn't move. And then I just kept getting nailed from behind."" He said his wife went to the hospital with chest pains after the crash. Friday's storm system crawled from Texas to the Atlantic Coast, starting before dawn Thursday and lasting until Saturday morning. During that period, 8.8 inches of snow fell on Harkers Island, North Carolina, according to weather service data. Other notable snowfall totals include: 14.9 inches in Duncanville, Texas; 6 inches in Belleville, Alabama; 6.1 inches in Shreveport, Louisiana; 8 inches in DeKalb, Mississippi; and 7.3 inches in Columbia, South Carolina. As of Friday, according to the National Weather Service, 68.1 percent of the United States was covered with snow, compared with 51.2 percent in January. Every state except Hawaii had some snow cover.","NEW: Most weather advisories canceled Monday except higher elevations in Alabama, Georgia .

61,"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- The man who flew an airplane into a building housing an Internal Revenue Service office may have replaced some of its seats with a drum of fuel to cause maximum damage, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said Friday. The official, who would not speak on the record because it is an ongoing case, said investigators have determined that the Piper Cherokee PA-28 had several seats removed and that a fuel drum was missing from the airport from which Andrew Joseph ""Joe"" Stack III took off Thursday morning. ""I think there is a good chance he might have put it on his plane,"" said the official, who cautioned that investigators were still working that lead and sifting through the crash site. The single-engine plane has a fuel tank capacity of 38 gallons and is equipped with four seats, according to the Web site risingup.com. The FBI said Friday it has taken the lead role in the investigation of Thursday's crash into the 7-story building in northwest Austin that held offices for nearly 200 IRS workers. ""You're talking about a federal agency that was basically assaulted,"" Ralph Diaz, special agent in charge of the FBI's San Antonio, Texas, field office, told reporters. Two people were killed and two others were hospitalized, federal officials said. Though the remains found in the IRS building have been identified, their identities will not be revealed until after a forensic examination, Diaz said Friday. ""One may be Mr. Stack and our fear is certainly the other would be either someone who was visiting or someone who was employed in the building,"" he said. Emergency services chief Ernie Rodriguez said one of the injured was treated and released; the other remained hospitalized. City of Austin Fire Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr credited the building's fire protection, fast work by the Fire Department and the fact that the employees had practiced exiting the building in case of an emergency for the low loss of life and injuries. ""It truly worked,"" she said. Austin attack stuns community . Rodriguez said units arrived on the scene within five minutes of the first 911 call prepared to manage hundreds of injured people. ""We found only two persons,"" he said. ""When you look at the fire, when you look at the evidence, it's hard to say that we were lucky, but we were,"" he said. ""The big thing to remember is that yesterday, in the midst of this event, God's grace was upon us."" Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo credited fast thinking by some people who were inside the building as the plane approached for the fact that few people were hurt. ""Some folks saw it coming and sounded the alarm yesterday, and some folks started running away from that side of the building,"" he said. Stack's wife, Sheryl Stack, expressed her ""sincere sympathy to the victims and their families"" Friday. ""Words cannot adequately express the sorrow or the sympathy I feel for everyone affected by this unimaginable tragedy,"" she said in a statement read by a family friend, Rayford Walker. Authorities say Stack also torched his $230,000 home in Austin on Thursday morning before embarking on his fatal flight. Police said Sheryl Stack spent Wednesday night in an Austin-area hotel but did not say why. Acevedo said police had received no calls of domestic violence from the house. The only calls to police were made a couple of years ago and concerned barking dogs, he said. A 3,000-word message on a Web site registered to Stack railed against the government, particularly the IRS. Read the apparent suicide note (PDF) ""I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different,"" the online message says. ""I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let's try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well."" Acevedo reiterated on Friday his assertion first made Thursday that the incident was not an act of terrorism. ""Part of our jobs in law enforcement is not to overreact and cause undue panic,"" he said. ""And with the information that we had, there was no need to alarm our colleagues around the country and community members by using the word 'terrorism.' That is why definitely I did not use it yesterday and I'm not using it today."" An IRS criminal investigator visited Stack's accountant after Thursday's events, leaving a business card on the CPA's front door. The online message believed to have been written by Stack mentions accountant Bill Ross, saying it had become ""brutally evident that he was representing himself and not me."" Watch what Stack's writing reveals about him . IRS investigator James L. Neff said that Ross is not under investigation; officials just wanted to make sure he was OK. ""We didn't know if he was alive or dead,"" Neff said. Ross, who did not return a call from CNN, was fine, the investigator said. Friends and former colleagues said Friday they had no inkling of the rage apparently building inside Stack. ""He hid that very well,"" said Billy Eli, in whose band Stack played bass until a few years ago. ""Obviously he was in some serious distress and had some real despair. I never saw that."" Neither did another former bandmate, Ric Furley. Watch how bandmates remember Stack . ""I never saw him in a bad mood or speaking negatively about anything or anyone,"" Furley told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""This has been such a shock because it was totally out of character with the Joe Stack I played with for three years,"" said Eli. ""We liked him,"" said Furley. ""We liked him."" Share information about the crash and the pilot . An IRS spokesman said federal law prohibits the agency from releasing information about any interactions the agency may have had with Stack. The IRS issued a statement Friday saying tax returns will not be delayed.

62,"(CNN) -- Nearly 2,000 miles from Haiti, there's a ripple effect from the earthquake that devastated the country on January 12. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have arrested 140 Haitian men and women who have crossed the border from Canada into Vermont since late January. Many had gone to Canada well before the earthquake to seek asylum, and thought they could take advantage of a relaxed U.S. policy on deporting Haitians. ""One of the things that's happening is that some of these individuals that have previously been either deported or ordered deported and are looking for refuge in Canada, have entered Canada illegally, are now looking to come back into the U.S. and possibly take advantage of the temporary protected status that our government has given,"" said David Aguilar, acting deputy commissioner at U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That temporary protected status allows Haitians who were in the United States at the time of the earthquake to stay longer, regardless of whether they were in the country legally or not. But the policy does not protect Haitians illegally entering the country now. ""We are going to apprehend them,"" said Aguilar. ""These are people that should not have come into this country and applied for a program that they do not benefit from."" That message was likely lost in translation,  said David Watts, a court-appointed attorney for three Haitians charged with illegal entry and jailed. ""I think there's no doubt that there was some confusion,"" Watts said. ""None of them have immigration lawyers, they're relying on the word on the street and the word in the community."" One of the men Watts represents is Arry Seguin, whose story is not uncommon. Seguin was living in the Haitian community in Montreal after going to Canada in 2008 to seek asylum. Until then, he had been living in Florida with his wife and two children, now ages 6 and 2. Seguin left the United States after losing appeals to stay. His wife, Louizette, a naturalized citizen, lives in a cramped apartment in Lantana, Florida, and doesn't understand why her husband can't join her. ""You see, everything is a mess without him. Nothing is working well without him,"" she says. She says she struggles to take care of her children, but she is also getting calls from relatives in Haiti who are desperate for help. It's the reason she believes her husband tried to return to Florida. He never made it far beyond the Canadian-Vermont border and was arrested in the early morning hours of March 21. Because Seguin doesn't have a criminal record, his lawyer was able to reach a settlement with prosecutors. For now, Seguin will be eligible to stay in the United States under supervised release, checking in with immigration authorities. It will be up to a judge to decide if that happens. Watts expects his client will released from jail soon. While Seguin will eventually face deportation, Watts says the goal is to return him to his family to weather their immediate personal crisis. ""So he will have achieved his goal, but for the fact that he's spent an awful lot of time in jail,"" Watts said. ""It would have been better, given what actually happened, if he had been able to come back and help sooner."" Taking the risk of getting caught was in the cards, says Chrissy Etienne, who works as an interpreter for the Haitian men and women who've been arrested. Etienne is a Haitian native living in Burlington, Vermont, having recently graduated from Middlebury College. Because she speaks Creole, she had signed up to be a translator and was stunned when attorneys called in February asking for help. Since then, her phone hasn't stopped ringing and she's met with dozens of Haitians who've been arrested, meeting them either in prison or in court. ""I think some thought there is a great chance I will get caught,"" says Etienne. ""I think some expected to get caught. I think it was get to the U.S. at all costs, get to my family at all costs."" ""I think that it is connected to the earthquake,"" says Etienne. ""When you lose your home, when you lose Haiti as a whole. What is left?"" Giving a voice to the arrested Haitians, she said, has been tough since she is restrained in what she can do. Etienne describes a common scenario with the men and women she deals with, saying, ""There is that, that wish for a system that is more personal. Couldn't I just explain this to a judge? To someone? That I am not a criminal. That I have no background or criminal background. I am just trying to get to my family. Isn't there someone who is going to believe that story? And who is going to hear me? ""And there is that moment where ... I know what the attorney is going to say and I have to relate it with that same sort of calm, collected feeling, but I am also watching someone fall apart.""","140 Haitians have crossed the U.S.-Canada border since the Haiti earthquake .

63,"(CNN) -- A 17-year-old boy was among the seven people killed in a noon shootout Friday on the streets of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, police said Saturday. The other victims were police officers, Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said Friday. Five were federal police officers and one was a female city police officer, all part of the joint police task force formed to combat drug violence in the border town. Another federal officer was gravely wounded, Reyes said, and a city officer was wounded but not with life-threatening injuries. A civilian was hit by shrapnel, but those injuries were also not serious, he said. Reyes said the incident began when two patrol cars, one from federal police and one from city police, stopped several people they had been investigating. Gunmen in at least two vehicles attacked the police convoy with weapons including AK-47s, he said. The federal police said the gunmen, who escaped in a gray Dodge Durango and a green Dodge Caravan, may have been drug dealers and that the attack may have been in response to several recent arrests in Juarez, including that of eight people apprehended Thursday for possession of weapons, drugs and a stolen van. The mayor said it wasn't immediately clear why the police had stopped the people or whether the incident was drug related. Investigators are treating the incident ""as a direct attack on police officers,"" he said. Federal police launched an aerial search for the gunmen's vehicles, but there have been no arrests. Reyes said at a meeting with federal police that he was ordering an increase of patrol cars so there will be three or four cars per location. About 800 police cars now patrol the city, Reyes said. The city police force consists of 3,000 officers, bolstered by 5,000 federal officers. Ciudad Juarez is the most violent city in the nation, with more than 2,600 drug-related deaths in 2009. No official numbers are available, but more than 400 killings have been reported by local media this year. The city, long the focal point of President Felipe Calderon's battle against drug cartels, came to renewed prominence after the January 31 killings of 15 people, most of them students with no links to organized crime. The massacre sparked outrage throughout Mexico and drew worldwide attention. In another incident that drew widespread attention, three people associated with the U.S. Consulate in Juarez were gunned down in two shootings last month. Two of the victims, including a pregnant woman, were U.S. citizens living in El Paso, Texas. CNN's Esprit Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Gunmen may be drug dealers retaliating several recent arrests, police say .

64,"(CNN)  -- Robin Dehaven usually replaces windows. On Thursday morning, after a small plane crashed into an Austin, Texas, office building, he was breaking them, having rushed into the burning structure to help people escape. Dehaven, an Army veteran who works for a glass company, was driving to a job when he witnessed the plane crash. With the building in flames and emergency personnel still minutes away, Dehaven drove his truck to the parking lot. People in the building were trapped, screaming for help. ""[Other people who'd gathered] said they needed my ladders on my truck, because there were people stuck on the second floor,"" Dehaven told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" He took a ladder off his truck and put it up to a window of a smoke-filled area where five people were trapped. ""The people were kind of in a panic, wanting to get out quickly, of course, so I climbed up into the building with them,"" Dehaven said. He then broke a nearby window under which the ladder could have better footing, and he helped the five escape, he said. See iReport photos and videos from the scene . Dehaven was one of several people who rushed to the site to help, local reports and the Texas governor's office said. ""In true Texas form, first responders and everyday citizens responded to today's plane crash with selfless acts of heroism, securing the area, evacuating the building and controlling the fire, and are to be commended,"" Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a written statement Thursday. Authorities said they believe pilot Joseph Andrew Stack III, 53, of Austin, intentionally crashed the small aircraft into the building, where nearly 200 Internal Revenue Service employees worked. Authorities said Stack apparently had a grudge against the IRS. The remains of two people were found in the building after the crash, and 13 other people were injured -- one seriously -- authorities said. The identities of the dead weren't released as of Thursday evening. Witnesses described a scene of panic, fire and smoke. Lyric Olivarez, who was working in a nearby building, told CNN affiliate KXAN that she felt her building shake when the plane crashed. ""It sounded like an explosion, but it felt like an earthquake,"" Olivarez said. ""Someone came into our office and said there was a bomb in the building next door. We had no idea it was a plane at the time."" When she and others ran outside, they saw the neighboring building in flames. ""People on the second and third floors were busting out windows, screaming, 'Help me! Help me! Get me out of here!' waving handkerchiefs or whatever they could find,"" Olivarez told KXAN. ""Not before long, the entire parking lot was filled with smoke, and people praying and crying,"" she said. ""I just saw smoke and flames,"" said CNN iReporter Mike Ernest. ""I could not believe what I was seeing. It was just smoke and flames everywhere."" Dehaven said that as he was driving before the crash, he could see the plane flying low, approaching the building. ""I saw it turn and start heading down like it was diving to come in for a landing, but there's no landing [strip],"" he said. ""So I knew it was going to crash."" He said his 6½ years in the Army, with two tours in Iraq, helped him Thursday. ""I've had some experience in triage and battlefield, with ... gunfire,"" he said. ""My first thought [was] maybe I can help, because I'm more used to dealing with traumatic situations like that.

65,"(CNN) -- A tornado almost a mile wide tore through Mississippi on Saturday, killing at least 10 people and causing significant injuries and damage as it raked cities from the central western border with Louisiana northeastward to Alabama. Two of the dead were children and one was a 3-month-old baby, according to Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) spokesman Jeff Rent. The death toll is expected to rise as rescue crews reach hard-hit areas where structures have been badly damaged, said another MEMA spokesman, Greg Flynn. Five of the dead were from Choctaw County, in the north central part of of the state, four were from Yazoo County, north of Jackson, and one was from Holmes County, also in the north central Mississippi, he said. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who was in Yazoo City where his home is located, called the twister ""gigantic"" and said that ""in places [it] seemed to be to be several miles wide."" Some residents were trapped in badly damaged homes, he said. ""They're working to get to the people and rescue as many as they can,"" said Dan Turner, a spokesman for the governor, reporting ""significant injuries"" in at least three counties. Residents from the region shared tales of tragedy and survival on Saturday evening. Dale Thrasher was inside Yazoo City's Hillcrest Baptist Church when it was flattened by the tornado. ""I went in the sanctuary and got under the pulpit table and the whole building fell around me,"" he said. His injuries: ""three little scratches."" Rob and Ashley Saxton were driving to a Yazoo City restaurant owned by Rob's father -- planning to take shelter in the restaurant's walk-in freezer ahead of the tornado -- when the twister blew out the car's windows at a red light. The car was tossed across the intersection, then picked up again and flung into the restaurant. ""When the windows exploded it wasn't like anything I've ever experienced,"" Rob Saxton said. ""It was amazing. It scared us plumb to death."" Watch Gov. Barbour's update on storm damage in Yazoo City . In all, 12 counties were reporting injuries, with some of the injured airlifted to a Level 1 trauma center at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, said Jeff Rent, a MEMA spokesman. The hospital has 27 patients with injuries sustained in the tornado, including eight adults in critical condition and six children in serious condition, according to spokesman Jim Albritton. Many tornado victims were seeking attention at King's Daughters hospital in Yazoo City, where only one doctor was on duty Saturday night, said Jess Silvino, a nurse there. The hospital is expecting ""another one or two waves of victims"" as crews are able to fully access the tornado's path, said Richard Summers, chairman of emergency medicine at the medical center. The hospital has crews in Yazoo City and Lexington that have been ""amazed and astounded"" by the amount of damage they're seeing, Summers said. The state's emergency management officials have set up a command post near U.S. 49 in Yazoo City and the state has activated a 25-person rapid response team from Hattiesburg that is capable of search and rescue operations. my601.com: Local reports of damage, fatalities . The governor said he is activating local members of the National Guard in Yazoo City to maintain order. President Obama has ""been briefed on the tragedy in Mississippi and the situation is being followed by the White House,"" Obama spokesman Bill Burton said. Barbour said that he has not yet requested emergency federal aid but that he plans to do so on Monday. ""FEMA is in contact and coordination with our state and local partners and stand ready to help if a request is made,"" said Brad Carroll, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agancy. Mississippi residents reported that the path of the twister was a half-mile to a mile wide, said Mark McAllister, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Jackson. CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said the tornado had traveled 150 miles across Mississippi, starting in the western part of the state and moving northeast before weakening as it moved into Alabama. In Yazoo City, Fire Chief Roy Wilson said that between 20 to 30 houses were destroyed, and said some people were trapped inside structures. Wilson said he didn't yet have confirmed numbers on injuries. ""It's in pretty bad shape so far,"" he said of the city. Speaking to reporters in Yazoo City, Barbour said that 17 injured have been taken to a hospital via ambulance and that two others were airlifted to Jackson. ""By God's grace [the tornado] did not go into the most central part of the city, the most populous. However, it went through the southern edge and eastern edge of town in a number of large neighborhoods,"" he said. ""A number of businesses have been destroyed and others severely damaged -- there are churches that have been obliterated."" The sheriff's department in nearby Hinds County is sending two dozen deputies and 100 inmates to assist with the response in Yazoo County and to clear debris, MEMA said.

In Holmes County, 50 homes sustained structural damage, the National Weather Service reported. Parts of three highways were closed due to downed trees and other damage: State Highway 3 in Yazoo County and State Highways 14 and 17 in Holmes County, according to the the Mississippi Department of Transportation. On I-55, traffic was down to a single lane in each direction in parts of Holmes County and in the area north of Pickens, the transportation department said. Linda Green, a dispatcher with the Issaquena County Sheriff's Department, said there was minimal damage in the area around Valley Park, and a few power lines were down. No injuries have been reported in Valley Park after the twister ripped through around 11:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET), she added. Valley Park is in Issaquena County, while Yazoo City is located in Yazoo County. Issaquena County is in the western part of the state, north of Vicksburg. Saturday's tornado was part of a broad band of storms that stretched from Missouri to the Florida Panhandle, Jeras said. The storm system struck Louisiana before it moved into Mississippi. A Tallulah, Louisiana, police dispatcher said a chemical plant in the city had been damaged, but could not give further details. Turner, the Mississippi governor's spokesman, said emergency response teams had been slowed by people out surveying the effects of the storm. ""One of the biggest obstacles is, of course, people are curious and want to get out and see the damage,"" he said. ""We've urged people to stay away from those areas, not only because it slows down the emergency response, but there are also still live electrical wires, there are open gas lines that will have to be shut down.""","NEW: At least 10 have been killed, including a 3-month-old, state emergency official says .

66,"(CNN) -- All three people on board a twin-engine plane died Wednesday when their aircraft crashed into a residential East Palo Alto, California, neighborhood, a spokesman with the Federal Aviation Administration said. The victims were employees of Tesla Motors, a luxury electric car company. ""Three Tesla employees were on board a plane that crashed in East Palo Alto early this morning. We are withholding their identities as we work with the relevant authorities to notify the families,"" said CEO Elon Musk in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with them. Tesla is a small, tightly knit company, and this is a tragic day for us."" The Cessna 310 took off from Palo Alto Airport at 7:53 a.m., FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said. During takeoff, the plane struck 60-foot high power lines, forcing the plane down onto a driveway, said Josh Cawthra, a National Transportation Safety Board aviation accident investigator. Four homes were affected, and two had fire damage, Menlo Park Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman said at a press conference. A day care in a house sustained heavy damage when the plane went down, East Palo Alto Police Capt. Carl Estelle said. No children were there at the time. The craft's fuselage landed in a house's yard, sparking a fire that destroyed several vehicles, Estelle said. One of the engines fell elsewhere in the neighborhood, apparently hitting the rear overhang of a yard, he said. ""Miraculously, incredibly, no one was injured on the ground,"" Schapelhouman said. The crash site was about one mile northeast of the airport, he said. The travelers were headed to Hawthorne Municipal Airport in Hawthorne, California, more than 350 miles south, according to Gregor. Gregor noted foggy conditions, but said it was not known if the weather played a role in the accident. Gregor said the cause of the crash was unknown. Patricia Armistad said she lives maybe four or five houses from the impact site. ""I heard a loud bang and when I went to my bedroom window I felt a big hit, like an earthquake,"" she said. She ran outside into the thick fog and immediately saw neighbors rushing to help, she said. Residents pulled people from the damaged houses and used their garden hoses to extinguish fires, she said. iReport: More photos from the scene . The crash triggered a massive power outage in the area. In addition to transmission lines, the aircraft also struck a transmission tower, Pacific Gas and Electric spokesman Joe Molica said. The tower and lines run electricity into neighboring Palo Alto, he said. Some 28,000 customers lost electricity, but power had been restored to all by 6:15 p.m., according to the City of Palo Alto Web site. CNN's Khadijah Rentas contributed to this report.","Plane crashes into East Palo Alto, California, neighborhood, fire chief says .

67,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- As soon as he heard the news about Haiti's earthquake, Myk Manon began planning to get himself and two fellow power specialists from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association into the heart of the disaster zone. On January 16, four days after the 7.0-magnitude quake had flattened much of Port-au-Prince and killed more than 200,000 people, the three engineers flew into the Dominican Republic, then drove into Haiti's capital, parked their truck in front of the U.S. Embassy -- where they figured they'd be safe -- and went to sleep. They would need it -- the city was dark, except for a few lights from private generators, and they knew their expertise would be in demand beginning the next morning. Here's what they found: All four power plants serving the city were off line; power lines lay on the ground all over the place; the earthquake had tossed 56-ton transformers from their bases. ""They literally jumped up 10 inches and tipped over,"" said Manon, 61, a California native and former Peace Corps volunteer. After finding $65-per-night rooms in a two-story, wooden hotel that had survived the earthquake, the men set about trying to find out how much of Electricity of Haiti's (EdH) system of substations and generators had also survived. But they found that the power system had already been in extremis. Before January 12, only 60 percent of Port-au-Prince's 3 million residents had electricity; nationwide, the figure was 40 percent, Manon said. Many of them were simply stealing it, tapping lines feeding streetlights. Before the quake, the capital had 60,000 paying customers, but there were 150,000 connections to the grid, and the power company was losing $1 million to $2 million per month, he said. ""In Haiti, that's a lot of money,"" he said. He credited donations from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez for having kept Haiti's lights on. Now, to get them on again, Manon faced the task of replacing thousands of poles, many of which had been crushed by toppling buildings. Manon and his colleagues, Bud Stanley and Christian Ponce, worked to get live lines to critical sites, like hospitals, water pumping stations and grocery stores. The men had at their disposal four trucks and 30 EdH workers, some of whom had lost their own families. As they went to work, the engineers carted what they could from the power company's warehouse, which had been condemned and was to be torn down. But there weren't enough poles, lines and other equipment needed to reilluminate a city the size of Port-au-Prince, he said. Nor were there any maps that would tell the engineers where the wires went once they left the plant. So they gave their teams GPS units and created the nation's first maps of its electrical grids, Manon said. The Haitian workers were inventive with the tools they had -- primarily pickup trucks carrying ladders -- but they had a view of safety that concerned their American counterparts. ""Safety is not a primary concern in the Haitian electric sector,"" Manon said. ""It would scare you to death."" Few wore basics, like hard hats, safety goggles or gloves, he said. Manon recalled a 1970s-vintage Ford truck that had been donated by one of their U.S.-based cooperatives to the Dominican Republic to help restore electricity after Hurricane Georges knocked out power nationwide in 1998. He made a couple of calls and found it sitting in a garage on the Dominican side of the island, paid a mechanic to get it running again, and had it driven to Haiti. That -- combined with two other trucks from the Dominican Republic and four other Haitian line trucks that ""sort of work"" and were already in the country -- was it for the specialized equipment needed to make rapid line repairs. The rest of the work is being done by people using pickup trucks and ladders, he said. They got the first of the capital's four plants back on line within 10 days of the earthquake, he said. The first place to get electricity restored was University Hospital, outside of which stacked bodies oozed fluids onto the paving stones. His biggest challenge was keeping his footing. ""Lord, don't let me fall on the bodies,"" he recalled telling himself, his voice cracking. Now, slightly more than a month after the earthquake, service has been restored to 25 percent of Haiti's customers, he said. Two of the city's four power plants are back on line, and a third is nearly ready, he said. Manon appealed Wednesday to a nationwide convention of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association in Atlanta for help getting teams of workers and trucks to Haiti. ""If we can get four or five teams, that would help a lot,"" he said. ""The international community is going to have to come forward now."" Manon's experience with the topic goes back to 1972, when he was a Peace Corps volunteer in Managua, Nicaragua, and an earthquake destroyed the center of the city, killing thousands.

68,"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- An explosion at close range, and not a direct hit, caused the 1,200-ton patrol ship Cheonan to sink last month, a team of South Korean military and civilian investigators has tentatively concluded. The investigators' determination was reported Sunday by the Yonhap news agency. ""Instead of being directly hit by a torpedo or other underwater weapon, the Cheonan was affected by a strong explosion that occurred below its bottom at a close range,"" the news agency quoted a government official as saying. The explanation matches one that investigators offered shortly after the ship's stern was salvaged 10 days ago. A final result is not expected for a month, Defense Minister Kim Tae-young told reporters. He said that the most likely cause of the sinking was a ""bubble jet"" created by the external explosion under the ship. A bubble jet effect occurs when an explosion goes off under a ship. The change in pressure causes a huge column of water that strikes the ship with great impact. On Saturday, recovery crews found the body of a missing sailor in the wreckage of the ship. The ship sunk in the Yellow Sea near the western sea border with North Korea on March 26. Forty of Cheonan's 104 crew members have now been confirmed dead, and six more are also believed dead, though they are still listed as missing. Fifty eight others were rescued before the vessel sank. South Korea has not ruled out a theory that North Korea was involved. But Seoul has avoided directly blaming North Korea, which sloughed off allegations it is responsible. The families of the dead sailors began a five-day mourning period on Sunday. On Thursday, the South Korean navy will hold a funeral ceremony at a naval command in Pyeongtaek, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of Seoul. The navy has also decided to posthumously promote the dead seamen by one rank and award them a military honor for their patriotism.","Report: Close-range explosion caused S. Korean ship to sink .

70,"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The death toll from Tuesday's fatal bomb blast in this country's northeast has increased to 75, Afghan officials said Friday. Afghan women weep over the coffins of victims from Tuesday's bomb blast. Zohur Afghan, a spokesman for Afghan Education Ministry, said that after a thorough investigation, officials determined that 59 schoolchildren and five teachers were killed and 93 children and three teachers were wounded. In addition, the blast killed six legislators and five of their bodyguards. It was the deadliest-ever suicide attack since the fall of the Taliban regime in late 2001. The victims were killed as they were visiting a sugar factory in northeastern Afghanistan's Baghlan province. The blast went off as schoolchildren lined the route where as many as 18 national lawmakers and dozens of local dignitaries walked on their way to visit a sugar plant as part of an economic assistance plan for the northeastern province. The ministry spokesman said the age of the students ranged from 8 to 17 years old. Afghan officials also said that the education minister has issued a ban on students assembling for such events in all schools around the country. Afghan President Hamid Karzai called the attack a ""heinous act of terrorism."" Among the lawmakers listed as dead was Mustafa Kazemi, the former commerce minister and spokesman for the opposition, who is also a top warlord in the region. Other lawmakers killed included Abdul Mateen, Alhaj Sahibur Rahman, Hajji Muhammad Aref Zarif and Sebghatullah Zaki, the statement said. E-mail to a friend .

71,"(CNN) -- The diabetes drug Avandia is linked with tens of thousands of heart attacks, and drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline knew of the risks for years but worked to keep them from the public, according to a Senate committee report released Saturday. The 334-page report by the Senate Finance Committee also criticized the Food and Drug Administration, saying that the federal agency that regulates food, tobacco and medications overlooked or overrode safety concerns found by its staff. ""Americans have a right to know there are serious health risks associated with Avandia and GlaxoSmithKline had a responsibility to tell them,"" said U.S. Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat and committee chairman. ""Patients trust drug companies with their health and their lives and GlaxoSmithKline abused that trust."" The bipartisan report also was signed by Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top-ranking Republican on the committee. GlaxoSmithKline rejected any assertions Saturday that the drug is not safe. ""We disagree with the conclusions in the report,"" company spokeswoman Nancy Pekarek told CNN. ""The FDA had reviewed the data and concluded that the drug should be on the market."" Seven clinical trials on the drug prove that it is not linked to heart attacks, Pekarek said. ""None of that data shows a statistically significant correlation between Avandia and myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction [heart attack],"" she said. Ischemia is a condition in which blood flow and oxygen are blocked from going to certain parts of the body. The Senate committee investigation stems from concerns that Avandia and other high-profile drugs put ""public safety at risk because the FDA has been too cozy with drug makers and has been regularly outmaneuvered by companies that have a financial interest in downplaying or under-exploring potential safety risks,"" the report states. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said she is waiting for the recommendations of an advisory committee that will hear reports on the drug this summer. ""Meanwhile,"" Hamburg said in a statement, ""I am reviewing the inquiry made by Senators Baucus and Grassley and I am reaching out to ensure that I have a complete understanding and awareness of all of the data and issues involved."" The Senate report was developed over the past two years by committee investigators who reviewed more than 250,000 pages of documents provided by GlaxoSmithKline, the FDA and several research institutes. Committee investigators also conducted numerous interviews and phone calls with GlaxoSmithKline, the FDA and anonymous whistleblowers. According to the Senate report: . • FDA scientists estimated in July 2007 that Avandia was associated with approximately 83,000 heart attacks since the drug came to market. ""Had GSK considered Avandia's potential increased cardiovascular risk more seriously when the issue was first raised in 1999 ... some of these heart attacks may have been avoided,"" the report states. • GlaxoSmithKline undertook attempts to undermine information critical of Avandia. ""GSK executives attempted to intimidate independent physicians, focused on strategies to minimize or misrepresent findings that Avandia may increase cardiovascular risk and sought ways to downplay findings that a competing drug might reduce cardiovascular risk,"" the report says. As an example, committee investigators say they found that GlaxoSmithKline experts verified an outside study showing the cardiac problem, but the company publicly attacked the findings as incorrect. • Two FDA safety officials sounded a clear alarm in October 2008 writing, ""There is strong evidence that rosiglitazone [Avandia] confers an increased risk of [heart attacks] and heart failure compared to pioglitazone [rival drug on market]."" They concluded and trials comparing the two would be ""unethical and exploitive."" Yet, the trial is still under way, the senators say. GlaxoSmithKline counters that the Senate report relies on outdated information. ""In essence, the report is a compilation of information and events that took place years ago,"" spokeswoman Pekarek said. ""There's no new data there."" The FDA has evaluated at the drug, Pekarek said, and updated product labeling in 2007 to say information on Avandia's relationship to myocardial ischemia is inconclusive. ""The FDA exists to ensure patient safety,"" she said. ""That is their purpose."" Avandia has been under scrutiny for years. The New England Journal of Medicine called the drug's safety into question in 2007. The Journal of the American Medical Association also questioned whether Avandia was safe in 2007. ""Among patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes, rosiglitazone use for at least 12 months is associated with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure, without a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality,"" the AMA journal wrote, adding that the ""findings have potential regulatory and clinical implications."" ""Regulatory agencies ought to re-evaluate whether rosiglitazone should be allowed to remain on the market,"" the report said. ""Health plans and physicians should not wait for regulatory actions. They should avoid using rosiglitazone in patients with diabetes who are at risk of cardiovascular events, especially since safer treatment alternatives are available."" Read the report . In 2007, an FDA panel recommended by a vote of 22-1 that Avandia should remain on the market despite an analysis showing links to increased risk of heart attack. The vote was not binding, but a suggestion to FDA regulators. The panel also voted 20-3 at the same meeting in support of data that showed Avandia increased the risk of cardiac ischemia in patients with the most common type of diabetes. The Senate report does not address the issue of whether Avandia should be removed from the market. CNN's Lisa Desjardins, Saundra Young, Miriam Falco and Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Avandia linked to heart disease, Senate committee report says .

72,"University Park, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The fatal explosions at the Upper Big Branch coal mine in West Virginia and the Deepwater Horizon oil rig off the Louisiana coast drive home important truths about our country's energy supplies. The first is that energy extracted from these sources is so valuable for our society that companies can afford to pay their workers premiums to risk their lives in dangerous circumstances. Massey Coal was extracting coal at Upper Big Branch at a cost of $35 per ton, and selling it for $60 per ton. BP and Transocean were extracting oil from Deepwater Horizon at a cost of $50 per barrel and selling it for $80 per barrel . The second is that there are no simple solutions to U.S. energy challenges. Wherever we get our energy, the price we pay for it is high. We should consider this seemingly obvious fact when we talk about moving toward an economy that uses less carbon in order to combat climate change. Make no mistake: This move will be costly and is not likely to happen any time soon. Scholars at Resources for the Futures, a Washington, D.C., environmental think tank, estimate that enactment of the Waxman-Markey bill (the American Clean Energy and Security Act) currently pending before the Senate will cost the average ratepayer anywhere from $136 to $413 per year. The reality is our economy is set up to burn coal for electricity and gasoline for cars, and moving away from this will be difficult, time consuming, and will compel consumers to decide whether they think it is worth it. Almost half of the electricity produced in the United States comes from coal, which is cheap, plentiful and secure. Yet besides the dangers to coal miners, coal comes with its own costs. Burning it for electricity creates sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. Scientists and engineers are working on making coal cleaner. One promising approach is carbon sequestration, in which carbon is separated out after burning coal. But once the carbon is separated, it is not clear what will be done with it. The best ideas involve storing it underground in former natural gas reservoirs. Making such storage facilities viable, however, will involve laying pipelines to transport highly compressed carbon dioxide hundreds of miles, likely against strong local opposition. Thus, for the foreseeable future, we are going to be using a lot of dirty coal. Oil has its own deficiencies in terms of pollution and safety of extraction. Burning oil creates a variety of noxious chemicals, as well as carbon dioxide. And, as the oil spill from Deepwater Horizon demonstrates, we will never be able to eliminate environmental threats from drilling. But right now, it is the only thing we have to propel most of our cars. Someday, electric cars may be able to take us farther than the local shopping mall. But even then, we'll have to get the needed power from an already overburdened electricity grid. Many have held up wind and solar power as the saving solutions for our energy future. But these energy sources, which provide about 2 percent of the nation's electricity, have their own drawbacks and hurdles. For example, promising offshore wind projects have been canceled because of local environmental concerns. Indeed, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar is scheduled to make a decision on a wind power project off the coast of Cape Cod in Massachusetts this week that has faced opposition from fisherman, local Indian tribes and tourism concerns. After years of discussion, there have still been no offshore wind turbines built in the U.S. And by itself, solar power is clean. But the needed rare-earth elements (such as dysprosium and terbium) are extracted through processes that are less than green. For example, extracting the elements from the raw materials mined requires a great deal of difficult-to-dispose-of and highly dangerous acids. (Rare-earth elements are also used in hybrid car motors.) Further, these elements come from China, giving the Chinese government power over our energy policies. But beyond that, there may be limits -- at least for the foreseeable future -- to how much our electricity grid can depend on wind and solar power. This all revolves around a particular word: ""intermittency."" A modern society requires that nonstorable electricity be available at all times to meet electricity demand, without a significant threat of blackouts. Unfortunately, wind and solar power are intermittent -- they depend on weather conditions, which can vary. Given this, there is a serious question as to how much the electricity grid can rely on these energy sources. Whether consumers will be willing to pay for green energy remains an open question. One example comes from Pennsylvania's restructured electricity markets. In these markets, residential customers have the option of paying for ""green"" power, mostly from wind sources, and somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of residential customers do so. This green power, however, raises electricity bills about 15 to 20 percent. Moving toward a greener economy will further raise these costs, as it will become harder and harder to find green power sources. If we want to address our country's energy concerns, we have to be willing to face one important fact: that creating such solutions will not be cheap. Different forms of energy are available, but using them will result in raising our electricity and gasoline bills significantly. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Kleit.","Andrew Kleit says recent coal and oil extraction disasters point up truth of our energy needs .

73,"(CNN) -- A major nor'easter is expected to bring blizzard conditions to interior New England and heavy rain and near-hurricane-force wind gusts to Northeastern coastal areas Wednesday through Friday. Little, if any, snow will fall in Boston, Massachusetts, while Washington, New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, could see as much as 5 inches of snow with locally higher amounts, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Record snowfall totals of 30 inches or more will be possible across upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, Morris said. Very strong winds will combine with the heavy snow to produce dangerous white-out conditions and widespread power outages. Share your winter weather videos and pics . Hurricane-force wind gusts combined with heavy rain are likely to cause significant flight delays and cancellations at all major airports along the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday and Friday, Morris said. Another storm was bringing heavy, wet snow Wednesday morning from Connecticut to Massachusetts. The National Weather Service predicted the weight of the snow would bring down tree limbs and power lines, causing scattered power outages. Scattered outages already were being reported in parts of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, where snowfall totals in the Berkshire Mountains could reach 24 inches by Wednesday night, the weather service said. Meanwhile, central Texas was digging out from up to 4 inches of snow after setting records with more than a foot less than two weeks ago. Sunshine was predicted for Wednesday, but CNN iReport contributor Robert Huntington of Austin, Texas, said the snow was falling hard in his neighborhood Tuesday. ""[They're] really big flakes, I mean, unusually large flakes,"" he said. ""It's Texas. Everything's bigger in Texas.""

74,"(CNN) -- A body found Monday beside a North Carolina road is that of 5-year-old Shaniya Davis, who was reported missing a week ago, police said Tuesday. The official cause of death was undetermined as of Tuesday afternoon, Fayetteville police said in written statement. An announced afternoon media briefing was rescheduled for Wednesday morning. Earlier Tuesday, police said additional charges are expected in connection with the case and any charges will be made public as soon as they are filed. Shaniya's mother, Antoinette Nicole Davis, has been charged with human trafficking and other offenses. Davis was ""prostituting her child,"" police spokeswoman Teresa Chance said after Davis' arrest over the weekend. Another suspect, Mario Andrette McNeill, has been charged with kidnapping in the case. Shaniya's father, Bradley Lockhart, made a tearful appeal before reporters Tuesday afternoon, asking that ""everybody makes it a point not to ignore, to look past a situation where a person, a child, or anybody might be in danger ... so that we don't have another tragedy like Shaniya."" He said authorities have given him limited information, but he was to meet with them later. ""It's not the result I wanted, it's not the result any father or family would want for their children,"" he said. ""But God has a greater calling for all of us."" Shaniya's mother reported her missing from their Fayetteville home in a mobile home park on November 10. According to police, surveillance video taken that day from a hotel in Sanford shows Shaniya in the company of McNeill. ""The investigation at this point indicates that Shaniya Davis was alive at the time she left the Sanford hotel,"" police said in the statement Tuesday. The road where the body was found is near Sanford, which is about 30 miles northwest of Fayetteville. Shaniya's half-sister, Cheyenne Lockhart, said on HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" Monday that she found it difficult to believe Davis had treated her daughter so poorly. ""She seemed like the sweetest woman. She didn't come from much, but ... she had the sweetest voice, she had the sweetest personality, and especially toward me. I would never think that she would do anything like that,"" said Lockhart, who shared a father with Shaniya. Their father said Shaniya went to her mother's home on October 9.

75,"(CNN) -- A tsunami advisory announced shortly after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Japan's Ryukyu Islands early Saturday has been canceled, Japan's Meteorological Agency reported. There was no tsunami damage ""though there may be slight sea level changes from now on,"" it said, referring to the areas affected by the advisory -- the Okinawa Islands, the Amami Islands and the Tokara Islands. The quake was centered 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) deep and struck at 5:31 a.m. (3:31 p.m. ET Friday) about 85 kilometers (53 miles) from Okinawa. The quake was felt on Okinawa, with shaking that lasted about 15 seconds, said Lt. Col. Daniel King of the U.S. Pacific Command. He told CNN that commanders in Japan and Hawaii were trying to get damage and casualty reports from U.S. military stations on Okinawa, but had heard nothing in the immediate aftermath. About 20,000 U.S. troops -- mostly Marines, along with Navy and Air Force personnel -- are stationed on eight bases on Okinawa, he said. Are you there? Send photos, video . iReporter Kristina Donaldson, who lives in central Okinawa, said the quake ""seemed to last longer than other ones we have experienced here."" ""We felt the quake pretty good this morning,"" she said, but life there was largely unaffected. ""I just walked down to the coastline and the kids are walking to school as they always do. No sirens, or any destruction from where we are."" Okinawa resident Eric Shepherd said his grandmother-in-law described it as the strongest quake she had felt in her 90 years on the island. ""It felt like some really bad airplane turbulence,"" Shepherd said, adding that one of his two children slept through what seemed like a minute-long ""rumble.""

76,"(CNN) -- A major winter storm walloped the Northeast on Friday, a day after heavy snow closed schools and roads and caused dangerous conditions. The storm knocked out power to nearly 240,000 homes and businesses in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, slowed traffic and could prompt authorities to cancel up to 1,000 flights at airports serving New York and New Jersey. The storm also frustrated people such as Lulis Leal, a medical office manager who was working from her home in Cedar Grove, New Jersey. She was planning to help her son move into an apartment when she peered out the window Friday morning to see her car covered in snow. ""I can't even move it out of my driveway,"" she said. ""The snow is up over my knee."" She ventured out amid the snow Thursday, saw several wrecks and added a half-hour to her trip by avoiding a snow-covered hill. ""It's very pretty to look at, but it's like, come on, enough already,"" she said. ""I'm very much looking forward to spring."" The rough weather prompted officials to suspend bus service in northern New Jersey. About 225,000 homes and businesses were without power Friday in New York, said Jim Denn of the New York State Public Service Commission. The storm left 10,638 homes and businesses without power in New Jersey and knocked out electrical services to about 3,000 homes and businesses in Pennsylvania, officials in those states said. A snow-covered tree limb fell Thursday in New York's Central Park and killed a 46-year-old man. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation warned residents to stay out of city parks after the death. Forecasters said parts of New York state could get up to a foot of snow, and public schools were closed Friday in New York City. ""The heavy, wet snow will be sufficient to bring down trees and power lines and could also cause roof collapses,"" the National Weather Service said. The storm is the third to hit the region this month. Early Friday, American Airlines had canceled 42 flights out of New York, a spokeswoman said. Delta Air Lines canceled 300 flights from airports in New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. U.S. Airways had canceled 80 flights from airports in and around New York, a spokesman said. Steve Coleman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said authorities expect roughly 1,000 flights to be canceled from the three major airports serving New York and parts of New Jersey. More cancellations were expected for other airlines Friday, according to airport officials. The storm prompted the cancellation of more than 1,000 flights at New York-area airports Thursday, said Port Authority spokesman John Kelly. Buried in snow? Send pictures, video . Parts of New York had received from 22 to 30 inches of snow by Thursday evening, the weather service said. Massachusetts was averaging 22 inches across the state. Parts of Pennsylvania had as much as 12 inches. Areas in Vermont received as much as 38 inches of snow. For some, any more snow was just too much.

79,"(CNN) -- When the January 12 earthquake hit Haiti, I watched hour upon hour of coverage on CNN. Like everyone else in the world, I saw images that were among the most horrifying caused by a natural disaster in our time. I had never been to Haiti at the time. Like many, I have friends and even family members of Haitian descent. But what occurred to me and most others were the questions: ""How could this happen and be so destructive?"" ""Why the lack of infrastructure?"" ""Why the lack of preparation for disaster?"" No country could be totally prepared for that kind of disaster, but Haiti and its people seemed to be particularly disadvantaged against Mother Nature's might. Click to find out more about CNN documentary ""Rescued"" I immediately got on my computer and began doing research, reading about Haiti's history. Admittedly, my American history dates were a bit foggy, so I tried to give myself a brief refresher. In school, we learned very early on about the abolition of slavery and Abraham Lincoln. But I was never taught that there was a small black nation in the Caribbean that had defeated Napoleon's army in 1803. That was the same year the French decided to sell their only other colony in the Western Hemisphere: Louisiana. Had the slaves, led by Toussaint L'Ouverture, not overthrown the French Army in Haiti, would the French have sold Louisiana to the United States? The Louisiana Purchase instantly doubled our country's size. Now, I have spent my time in Louisiana. I graduated from Louisiana State University. But I never linked these two events. I am sure historians do, but does the average American know that the Haitian revolution possibly played a large role in the history of the United States of America? So, I ask myself, had Toussaint L'Ouverture not lived, would America be the America it is today? If his army and the slaves had not defeated the French, would the French have wanted to sell their only other colony, so close to Haiti? So, the earthquake made me begin to read about history and look at events a little more closely. I do not understand why a country so close to some of the richest economies in the world could be in this position. I am not a political person by nature. But it does make you wonder how politically and historically, Haiti's own government and those of nearby countries have shown no accountability. That same day, I began to get calls from many organizations, people I do business with, friends asking for financial assistance and donations. I kept responding: ""Get back to me on what to do for the children."" ""Call me on what we can do with the schools."" ""Can someone find me someone dealing with the orphan situation?"" ""Are these kids going to be out on the streets being sold into God knows what?"" I continued to be overwhelmed with requests, and to be honest, was very concerned about people taking advantage, or looking for their ""moment in the spotlight to look like a savior,"" or that conversations seemed premature or were losing focus on the big picture. You could not be human and look at the images and hear the stories and not feel helpless and complete empathy for those who were suffering. Amid the chaos of what was unfolding on television, I tried my best to put myself in the place of the people and children who were living this reality. What does it feel like to lose a family member, or many family members and friends all at one time? Parents? Children? What does it feel like to be trapped inside a building that has fallen around you, in many cases for days, waiting for someone to find you and dig you out. What does it feel like to be hungry and without water for days at a time, not knowing if you will ever taste anything again? Now, months later: What does it feel like to be abandoned? What does it feel like to have a leg amputated, no parents, and live in a tent outside an orphanage that you cannot go inside? I can only imagine. I cannot walk in the shoes of those who lived it. I also realized that I know nothing about emergency response, foreign aid or medical care. What I do know is that I can be effective in keeping the light on a problem -- a problem that will not be solved for a long, long time. This is a country full of young children who will be permanently affected by this catastrophe. It is our responsibility to help Haiti solve this problem, as long as it takes to do it. We must not only rebuild the country, its roads, its buildings and its government. We also have to rebuild its children. It is an emergency to get these children back in schools. It was already an emergency before January 12, when a large percentage of children were not in school. It is an emergency to protect their human rights, it is an emergency to give them health services and prevent diseases that have long-term impact. We must treat these children like children. They need music and arts and sports. They need trained teachers who can educate and protect them during the school day. They need to have safe places to play. They need access to computer labs, technology and modern education tools. I decided this is what I would focus on. How could I lead in contributing for immediate needs -- but also for those that linger? A bed to sleep in and a roof over their heads. Schools. Computers. Teachers. Books. Soccer fields. Basketball courts. Parks. That is it. Our team traveled to Port-Au-Prince and Jacmel over the past few weeks, and we are returning again this month. We have joined in partnership with the United States Foundation for the Children of Haiti. The team met with the most amazing woman, Gladys Thomas, who has been serving the children in her homeland of Haiti since 1981. Thomas has led the foundation in developing a full spectrum of services for the growing number of children brought into her care. We will support her organization and work to support La Foundation Pour les Enfants d'Haiti, a nonprofit and nongovernmental Haitian organization. Our foundation O'Positive, along with Greenhouse International, will support the ongoing need to rebuild the infrastructure and buildings for School of Good Shower, Hope Hospital and Children's Hope Village, which both serve Haitian orphans in her care. O'Positive and I will also be working on a partnership with Save the Children and Harvard University Innovation Lab in Haiti to help provide infrastructure and quality education, teacher training and supplies the children need to succeed. So many people have already given so much. But this effort is just  beginning. It has been four months since that horrible day. One-third of a year. Thousands of children are sitting in tents each day, with nowhere to go and nothing to do. It is easy to forget about what is no longer on the front page or staring you down on your TV or computer. We get back to our normal lives. But remember, these children cannot resume their normal lives. We must not forget that in order to rebuild Haiti, we must rebuild its youth. We must not leave them behind. Their lives cannot end at the hands of an earthquake. Let's find the light in the storm, and build a future for the children.

80,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- The edges of the massive Gulf Coast oil slick grazed the barrier islands off Louisiana's Chandeleur and Breton sounds Tuesday as the company responsible for cleaning up the spill faced tough questions from members of Congress. With a damaged undersea well still spewing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana's coastal parishes made new plans to keep the oil from moving into Lake Borgne and Lake Pontchartrain, which flank New Orleans. Winds that complicated efforts to fight the spill died down Tuesday, making cleanup work easier, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said. ""It's a gift of a little bit of time,"" she told reporters. ""But I'm not resting."" The spill threatens wildlife, beaches and livelihoods along the Gulf Coast. Already federal officials have banned fishing in the affected area until at least May 12, curtailing a commercial seafood industry that brings in about $2.4 billion to the region every year. The leading edge of the slick was reported to be lapping at the edge of Louisiana's Chandeleur Islands early Tuesday, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said. ""Let's make no mistake about what's at stake here. This is our very way of life,"" Jindal told reporters. ""This is our fishing communities, these are some of our coastal communities. We're talking about keeping this oil out of our fragile wetlands."" But as of mid-afternoon, no oil had been found washed up on the islands, said Doug Suttles, chief operating officer for BP, which owns the damaged well. ""To give you a sense of our ability to respond, we launched 22 vessels,"" Suttles told reporters at a news conference in Mobile, Alabama. Twelve of those vessels were shrimp boats whose skippers have volunteered to assist in the cleanup, he said. ""They've been in the area ever since trying to locate that oil and make sure it actually doesn't reach shore,"" Suttles said. The edge of the slick was reported to be about 20 miles off the Mississippi Coast, and Landry said it was about 30 miles off the shores of Alabama. Suttles said BP workers expected to close off one of the three leaking points Tuesday, but added, ""I don't believe that will change the total amount of oil that will be leaked."" Stephen Herbert, chef and owner of Abita Springs Cafe on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, said the potential impact was ""tremendous."" But Herbert, who holds a degree in fish biology and lived in the marshes for 10 years before entering the restaurant business, expressed surprise that the story has become a national one. ""I'm really astounded that the rest of the people in the United States really give a flip about this,"" he said. Louisiana's coastal marshlands have been shrinking at the rate of two football fields a day for a quarter-century, he said, ""and nobody gave a flip about that."" Herbert's 16-table restaurant, located 25 miles from New Orleans, specializes in Cajun food, and at least half of his orders are for meals that contain fish. In anticipation of rising prices, he ordered an extra gallon of shucked oysters and another case of shrimp, but that was all his refrigerators could store, the 56-year-old restaurateur said. The estimated 210,000-gallon-per-day flow of oil from the damaged well continued unabated Tuesday, 12 days after the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon sank off Louisiana. The break in the winds kept the slick from advancing much toward the coast, but Jindal said the weather is expected to turn unfavorably Thursday. The first oil was not expected to reach the shores of the U.S. mainland for another three days, Suttles said. As owner of the well, BP is responsible for the cleanup and its costs. It blames Transocean, which it hired to drill the well, for the failure of a critical piece of equipment that was designed to shut off the well in case of emergency. Across the Gulf Coast, emergency workers and volunteers helped string floating booms across inlets and beaches in an attempt to fend off any advancing oil. Chocolate-colored streaks of oily water could be seen off Dauphin Island, on the Alabama coast. And crew boats that normally supply oil wells were laying booms around Ship Island, off the shores of Mississippi and about 10 miles north of the spill's leading edge. But Capt. Louis Skrmetta, who runs excursions out to the Mississippi Sound barrier islands, said efforts to protect the islands and waterways were inadequate. He said Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour -- who called the spill ""a manageable problem"" Monday -- was doing less to combat the oncoming slick than his counterparts in Alabama and Louisiana. KNOE: Community rallies around rig families . ""The governor's leaving it up to BP. They're just not doing enough,"" Skrmetta said. BP hopes to place a four-story-high metal container over part of the leaking drill pipe, a step it says could corral about 80 percent of the leaking oil. The oil would then be pumped to a drill ship on the surface. Suttles said the 70-ton box could be ferried out to the site of the leak by midnight Wednesday, but it will take another two days to place the device on the seabed. Then it must be connected to the drill ship. ""Hopefully, we'll be operational within about about six days,"" he said. Hundreds of thousands of feet of booms have been strung around the estuaries of southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and far western Florida in recent days. But an aerial tour conducted by the Coast Guard on Tuesday showed some have already given way, and high winds in recent days have driven oil past others. The Deepwater Horizon caught fire April 20 and burned for two days before sinking, with 11 workers presumed dead. Executives from BP and Transocean Ltd., looked ""like deer in the headlights"" when they briefed members of the House Energy and Environment committee about the accident and response on Tuesday, said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas. KATC: Gulf shrimp season to temporarily close . Barton is a strong supporter of offshore drilling, and told reporters he didn't want the accident to reverse support for more exploration off the U.S. coasts. But he said he had hoped for ""more concrete"" answers from the oilmen. ""I have concerns in this particular case about the attention to safety, the attention to maintenance, the attention to using best available control technology and best monitoring practices,"" Barton said. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, said the situation could get dramatically worse. ""One of the questions which I asked was what would happen if a worst-case scenario did unfold?"" he told reporters after the hearing. ""I was told that the amount of oil per day could actually rise from 5,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil a day, although in a worst-case scenario, the most likely number was in the 40,000 barrel range, which only reinforces the necessity of us acting as quickly as possible, for BP and all responsible, for shutting off this catastrophic leak of oil."" But Dave Nagel, the executive vice president of BP America, said the company is ""doing everything we can to respond to this incident."" ""That's our complete focus right now -- to stop the leak at the scene, to disperse the oil the best we can and protect the beaches and mitigate the impact,"" he said. ""That's what we're doing."" That may not be enough to satisfy lawmakers, said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida. ""Privately, I've gone up to some senators who have been for drilling and I have sarcastically said to them, in a whisper, 'Drill, baby, drill,' and they roll their eyes as if in mock horror at the possibilities of what could happen as a result of this disaster.""

81,"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly two weeks after an explosion aboard an oil rig caused a leak from an undersea oil well off Louisiana, the impact is just beginning to unfold. Though the widening pool of oil remained offshore Monday, it was already a presence for some coastal areas. John Kelly, administrator of Gulfport, Mississippi, said he had been able to smell it since Friday. ""I got $3 million worth of boats sitting here,"" said Capt. Louis Skrmetta, who ferries tourists from Gulfport to the state's pristine barrier islands. ""What am I going to do with them?"" BP's ruptured undersea well continues to spew about 210,000 gallons -- or 5,000 barrels -- of crude per day into the Gulf of Mexico. Efforts to contain or curtail the spill have been unsuccessful. The sheen extends up to 60 miles across and threatens the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, as well as the Florida Panhandle, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That's an area nearly as large as the state of Delaware. The slick was nine miles off the Louisiana coast Monday, said Adm. Thad Allen, commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard and incident commander. BP chief executive Tony Hayward vowed that the oil giant would ""absolutely be paying for the cleanup operation"" of the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico. ""Where legitimate claims are made, we will be good for them,"" he told NPR's ""Morning Edition."" The U.S. government was leaving little to chance. Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that Justice Department employees were in the Gulf region ""to ensure that BP is held liable."" Allen said BP ""is the responsible party"" and ""will bear all the costs"" of the cleanup. Still, the promises failed to quell the fears. ""I hope we can weather the storm,"" said Keith Delcambre, owner of seafood market Bozo's in Pascagoula, Mississippi. WLOX: Pass Christian Harbor in Mississippi prepares for oil . He said the nature of the current disaster could exact more of a toll on seafood than  Hurricane Katrina, which savaged the Gulf Coast in August 2005. ""We weathered Katrina, but shrimp after Katrina was good,"" he said. ""Seafood after Katrina was good. With all the oil out there, I don't know what to expect. This is brand new."" In Gulfport, officials worried that a drop in tourism from the slick would chill the city's post-Katrina rebound, which includes half a billion dollars in new construction, $30 million of which has been spent on the harbor. ""This could not have happened at a worse time in our history,"" Kelly, the city's administrator, said. Katrina left equipment operator Daniel Schepens out of work for a month, but the oil slick could prove worse, he said. ""The warehouses are empty. No trucks, no imports, no exports."" ""If it threatens the commercial sea lanes, that's a concern, because if ships don't come in and ships aren't able to go out, that stops commerce,"" said Donald Allee, CEO of the Mississippi State Port Authority. WWL: Fishermen try to help contain oil slick . For now, the harbor is being used as a loading point for hundreds of miles of booms that are intended to defend against the slick's arrival. But the booms may not protect the coast any more than the levees protected New Orleans during Katrina: Rough seas have already broken apart some of the booms. WDSU: Rush to save Lake Pontchartrain . Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist on Monday extended a state of emergency to 13 coastal counties in his state and said he might extend it to two more on Tuesday. He had issued an emergency declaration last week for six counties on the western end of the Florida Panhandle; Monday's declaration added the rest of the Panhandle, and counties on the Gulf Coast of the main Florida peninsula as far south as Sarasota. ""In the event that the oil does come to our shores, I want us to be ahead of it as much as humanly possible,"" he told reporters. Preparations continue on strategies to stop the leak, though each plan has drawbacks. One plan is to lower a dome over the wellhead next week to capture the spewing oil, said Florida Secretary of Environmental Protection Michael Sole. ""That would stop the flow -- if successful,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, it's never been tried at 5,000 feet below the surface of the water."" Officials warn of possible catastrophe . BP also is having a contractor drill a relief well that would allow workers to plug the first well. ""Unfortunately, that's a two- to three-month operation,"" Sole said. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and other Obama White House officials met Monday afternoon with Hayward and BP America President Lamar McKay to discuss the response efforts. On Sunday, federal officials banned fishing for at least 10 days in the northern Gulf of Mexico from the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana to waters off Florida's Pensacola Bay. The Gulf Coast's commercial fishing industry brings in about $2.4 billion to the region. WDSU: Oil spill closes fishing waters . The spill cast a pall over the annual boat blessing ceremony in St. Bernard, Louisiana, where fishermen have observed the tradition for decades to usher in the shrimp season. On Monday, Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, joined Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser on a conference call with President Obama and Coast Guard officials. Officials are fighting the spill on three fronts, Napolitano said Monday. ""One is to cap the well"" that is leaking the oil, she said. Authorities are also fighting the slick at sea before it reaches land, and preparing to clean it up immediately if it does make landfall, she said. In Venice, Louisiana, Obama told reporters Sunday that his administration has launched a ""relentless response"" to the spill, but the problem might not be solved for many days. WDSU: Fishermen to help oil cleanup . The oil spill started April 20, after an explosion on BP contractor Transocean Ltd.'s Deepwater Horizon drilling platform left 11 men presumed dead. The spill will have ""a multidecade impact,"" a ""long-term poisoning"" of the area, said Richard Charter of the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. Booms were strung across the mouths of delta estuaries in Louisiana and inlets along the Mississippi coast. In Alabama, National Guard troops helped lay them out off Dauphin Island, at the southern end of Mobile Bay. The cause of the blast remains unknown. BP says a device known as a ""blowout preventer"" failed and has not responded to repeated attempts to activate it using remotely operated submarines. How the oil spill crisis could affect BP . Frustration with BP has been growing across the Gulf states, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has said the company's response has been inadequate. Some 200 vessels, including skimmers, tugboats and nine remotely operated underwater vehicles are on or near the site, BP's Chief Operating Officer Douglas Suttles told reporters. BP spokeswoman Marti Powers said the company was trying to use the submarines to activate the blowout preventer at the ocean floor and spreading dispersants on and under the water to break up the slick. The company has put out about 300,000 feet -- roughly 60 miles -- of floating booms to keep the oil away from ecologically sensitive shorelines, she said. But she said efforts to skim oil off the surface were put off because of bad weather. ""Some of the vessels can't get out,"" she said. ""But they are still making the effort.""

82,"(CNN) -- Some of the worst flooding the mid-South has seen in decades is thought to be responsible for at least 11 deaths in Tennessee, the Nashville and state emergency management offices said Sunday. Five of the deaths were in Davidson County, which encompasses Nashville, according to the Nashville mayor's Office of Emergency Management. The rains have closed interstate highways, displaced thousands from their homes, prompted evacuations of hotels and nursing homes and turned city streets and parking lots into raging rivers. Parts of the state have been drenched with up to 20 inches of rain, with more expected. iReport: Experiencing the Tennessee floods? Send photos, video . On Sunday night, multiple vehicles were trapped by water on Interstate 40 with water rising around them and with authorities working since the afternoon to get to the cars, according to the Office of Emergency Management. Authorities have recovered bodies from a flooded house in Nashville and from an upside down vehicle floating on a flooded road, among other places, the mayor's office said in a release Sunday night. Two young men who'd gone tubing on a flooded creek on Sunday evening were missing, the mayor's office said. Also on Sunday night, authorities were working to evacuate more than 500 residents from the MetroCenter in north Nashville. ""All of our major creeks and the Cumberland River are near flood level, if not at flood level,"" Nashville Mayor Karl Dean said at a press conference Sunday, referring to the waterway that bisects Nashville. ""The ground is entirely saturated, and the rain continues to fall. There's nowhere for the water to go."" The western two thirds of Tennessee has seen between 6 and 20 inches of rain since Saturday, with flooding spreading to Kentucky on Sunday. In Nashville alone, more than 600 people were rescued from the water this weekend, Dean said. Dean said Sunday that more rain has fallen in Nashville in the last 24 hours than has ever been recorded in the city.

""We are still at this point in rescue stage and will be until the water begins to subside,"" he said. Dean urged residents to stay home Sunday and, if they could, to skip work on Monday, when Nashville schools will be closed and public transportation will be suspended. Two of the three temporary shelters -- which can each house 200 people -- opened by the Nashville mayor's office had reached capacity by Sunday evening. The Red Cross reported approximately 400 people in 22 shelters throughout Tennessee. The floods shut down parts of interstates 24, 40 and 65 around Nashville on Saturday and Sunday. The floods left 36,000 houses around Nashville without power on Sunday, while all Davidson County residents were asked to use water for essential purposes only after flooding closed one of the city's water treatment plants. Flooding also led to the evacuation of three area nursing homes, affecting more than 250 patients, Dean said. Opryland Hotel expected to lose power Sunday night and staffers planned to ask their guests to evacuate, according to Janel Lacey, a spokeswoman for the Nashville mayor's office. While some streams around Nashville were starting to recede on Sunday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was planning to release dammed upstream water Sunday night, which could cause more flooding around Nashville, city emergency management chief Stephen Halford said. The water needed to be released to keep the Army Corps equipment safe, Halford said. The National Weather Service issued a civil emergency message Sunday to central and western Tennessee, telling people to stay off roads because too many are closed and people are getting stranded. The weather service also issued a flood emergency Sunday for much of central Kentucky -- where tens of thousands were trying to get home after this weekend's Kentucky Derby -- and in south central Indiana. In Louisville, Kentucky, the National Turnpike and Gene Snyder Freeway were closed on Sunday. In addition to flooding fatalities, one Tennessean died over the weekend in a tornado in Hardeman County, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said Sunday. The mayor's Office of Emergency Management in Nashville announced Sunday night that it had confirmed five fatalities in Davidson County -- which encompasses Nashville -- thought to be flood-related.","NEW:  Bodies recovered from a flooded house and an upside down vehicle on a flooded road .

83,"(CNN)  -- A month after announcing plans to expand offshore drilling, President Obama visited ground zero of the Gulf Coast oil disaster and warned that residents could be facing a ""potentially unprecedented environmental disaster."" ""The oil that is still leaking from the well could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our Gulf states and it could extend for a long time. It could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home,"" Obama said Sunday in Venice, Louisiana. The president reiterated that oil company BP is responsible for the leak and will foot the cost of the cleanup.  He pledged to ""spare no effort to respond to this crisis for as long as it continues."" Obama's remarks were a stark contrast from his late March proposal to open swaths of U.S. coastal waters in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico to oil and natural gas drilling. Obama said then that the decision did not come lightly, but it was one that he approached with confidence. ""The bottom line is this: Given our energy needs, in order to sustain economic growth and produce jobs, and keep our businesses competitive, we are going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable, homegrown energy,"" he said as he unveiled his plans. Obama said the federal government would begin the process of leasing some areas off the coasts of Virginia, Alaska and possibly Florida to oil companies for drilling. New offshore drilling in most U.S. waters has been banned since the early 1980s, when mounting public pressure pushed lawmakers into action. A disastrous oil spill off the California coast in 1969 sparked protests that grew into a broader environmental movement, which eventually forced a drilling moratorium. But as the environmental impact of the Gulf Coast spill comes ashore, the appetite for Obama's offshore drilling plan and the enthusiasm from administration officials appear to have subsided. CNNMoney: Oil spill may threaten offshore drilling plans . ""All he has said is that he's not going to continue the moratorium on drilling,"" White House senior adviser David Axelrod told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Friday. ""No domestic drilling in new areas is going to go forward until there is an adequate review of what's happened here and of what is being proposed elsewhere."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday that moving ahead on offshore drilling is ""going to require a balancing act."" ""That is a national security concern because we have to do better to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. But it has to be done safely. It can't be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars cleaning up these spills,"" she said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" And Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Sunday that the Gulf Coast disaster ""sends out the clarion call that we need to diversify our energy resources."" ""Our intention is to move forward thoughtfully, looking at how we can protect the resources of the United States and making thoughtful decisions,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" noting that deep-water drilling has been done thousands of times without incident. Time.com: Obama promises help, but containing spill is still talk . Obama said Friday he still believes that domestic oil production is an important part of the strategy for energy security, but he added, ""I've always said it must be done responsibly, for the safety of our workers and our environment."" The president ordered Salazar to conduct a review of the oil spill and report back in 30 days on what precautions, if any, should be required to prevent future accidents. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida has asked Obama to shelve his proposal, at least until the cause of the current spill is fully investigated. In a letter to the president, Nelson also said he would file legislation ""that would, for the time being, prohibit the Interior Department from acting on your administration's plans to expand offshore drilling, including seismic testing and other exploratory operations."" Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who in the past has been a proponent of offshore drilling, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that such drilling has ""got to be tabled, for sure."" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs indicated last week that Obama's offshore plans aren't set in stone. ""I think our focus right now is, one, the area, the spill, and two, also to ultimately determine the cause of it and see the impact that that ultimately may or may not have,"" he said, noting that Obama's announcement was the beginning, and not the end, of a longer process. CNNMoney's Steve Hargreaves contributed to this report.","Obama says Gulf Coast oil spill is a ""potentially unprecedented environmental disaster""

84,"(CNN)  -- I spent a restless night, worrying that another man-made disaster might devastate my beloved hometown, New Orleans, just as its post-Katrina motto ""Recover, Rebuild, Rebirth"" was becoming real. The oil spill couldn't come at a worse time. Everybody was so up, waiting for the inauguration of our newly elected Mayor Mitch Landrieu. The BP oil spill threatens New Orleans and the entire Gulf Coast in a way that's more insidious than Hurricane Katrina. After all, the failure of the levees and the response from the previous administration, widely criticized for incompetence and indifference, followed an act of nature: the destruction, immediate; the impact, obvious; and the pain and suffering, visible to all. The BP disaster has only one cause: human greed, and the almost inevitable result, negligence. The immediate tragedy was that 11 people died. But the destruction that will result from BP's ""crude river"" will be long-term and the impact far from obvious. The ""crude river"" will spawn streams of suffering: economic, environmental and emotional. So as the ""Big Muddy"" fights the ""Big Cruddy,"" how do we assess the players? And what actions should be taken against rigged disasters, both once and future? First, we must hold BP accountable and responsible. Was it an accident? Only if we define ""accident"" as negligence. The failure of the ""shear ram,"" the set of steel blades intended to slash through a pipe at the top of a well and close off the flow of crude, should not have surprised BP or the corporations that work for it. Eight years ago, the Minerals Management Service found that 50 percent of the shear rams tested failed. So calling the failure of the ""last resort device"" an accident is like calling the damage caused by a drunken driver an accident. Failure to take the proper precautions is not an accident; it's negligence. BP has rightly accepted responsibility. We may grant the company a skeptical benefit of the doubt regarding its willingness to pay for the cleanup and the damages. We should, however, monitor its PR-to-payout ratio. But we should not lose sight of the role of companies like Halliburton, under investigation because it was responsible for the cement seal that apparently leaked; Cameron International, which supplied the rig's blowout prevention system; or Transocean, which manufactured the rig. As the federal government begins its investigation, it should ask not only who was negligent, but why. To what extent did profit preclude prudence? Since BP can't contain the spill -- rather, the river, which is what it really is -- government at all levels must do what it's supposed to do, and do it right. For example, officials should carry out Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser's plan to deploy local fishermen with booms on movable platforms in the Gulf, ready to ""draw a line in the sand,"" depending on how the oil moves. Gov. Bobby Jindal has approved. Already the response from the Obama administration exceeds that of the federal response to Katrina, and the oil hasn't yet begun to cause the catastrophic damage we all fear. The morning after the explosion, Deputy Secretary of the Interior David J. Hayes was sent to the Gulf. The morning after the explosion, Deputy Secretary of the Interior David J. Hayes was sent to the Gulf. President Obama began monitoring the situation, staying in contact with the governors of the five Gulf states, making sure every available resource be at their disposal and ordering a coordinated Cabinet-level response. Here are a few authorizations the president has made, before his personal visit. • The U.S. Coast Guard; the Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce and Interior; and the Environmental Protection Agency immediately began directing and overseeing BP's response. • The Navy is using advanced technology and working with the Coast Guard to contain and disperse the oil. • The Departments of Homeland Security and Interior will be investigating the cause and inspecting all platforms and rigs in the Gulf. • The secretary of defense is authorizing the Louisiana National Guard to help communities in the cleanup and to protect critical habitats from contamination. But Obama has to let people know what's being done, what will be done, and that he takes this personally. He needs to express, perhaps as only he can, that the federal government gets it. He gets the plight of the fishermen, the restaurants, the waiters, the taxi drivers -- the economic ripple effect and the environmental tide of disaster. This is a visual and visceral crisis. If he handles it right, it will be known as a sign of Obama's competence. Obama can't split the sea, but he must help to plug the Gulf.

85,"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- President Obama said Sunday his administration has mounted a ""relentless response"" to the oil spill unleashed by the sinking of an offshore drill rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Obama met with local, state and federal officials involved in the cleanup in southeastern Louisiana, the closest stretch of coastline threatened by the massive spill. Afterward, he said that despite ""the most advanced technology available,"" the spill may not be stopped for many days. ""I'm not going to rest, and none of the gentlemen and women who are here are going to rest or be satisfied, until the leak is stopped at the source, the oil on the Gulf is contained and cleaned up and the people of this region are able to go back to their lives and their livelihoods,"" he said. ""We will spare no resource to clean up whatever damage is caused."" Obama met with the commandant of the Coast Guard, Adm. Thad Allen; EPA administrator Lisa Jackson; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal; and the presidents of several parish governments after arriving, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. The president's briefing included an update on the procedures being attempted to cap the well and the economic and environmental impact of the spill, Gibbs said. After landing in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Sunday, Obama joined Jindal on a two-hour drive to Venice, a staging ground for efforts to fight the growing slick. Appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Allen warned that the leaking oil from a rig explosion could continue for weeks with dire consequences. ""It potentially is catastrophic,"" Salazar said. ""I think we have to prepare for the worst."" That would mean oil damaging sensitive coastal wetlands and industries, including a vital fishing sector that was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Obama initially planned to fly over the affected area by helicopter, but weather conditions prevented the flight. Before his trip, Cabinet officials warned he would find a dire situation. Officials warn of possible catastrophe . Salazar blamed the explosion that caused the spill on a failure in rig technology intended to prevent so-called blowouts. ""There is no doubt at all here that what has happened is the blowout prevention mechanism at the bottom of the well ... is defective,"" Salazar said. ""While there have been blowouts in the past, we have never seen anything that has been quite of this magnitude."" The well is owned by oil company BP. Lamar McKay, president of BP America, told ABC's ""This Week"" that the company doesn't know why the blowout preventer failed. All three officials interviewed by CNN repeatedly emphasized that BP is legally responsible for spill and clean-up efforts. They avoided direct criticism of the company, but said BP must do more to try to cap the gushing well. Allen called the spill ""one of the most complex things we've ever dealt with,"" and said it was impossible so far to predict how much oil will eventually leak. ""If we lost a total well head, it could be 100,000 barrels or more a day,"" he said. BP said two Louisiana communities, Venice and Port Fourchon, will likely be the first places hit by the oil slick. Nearly 1 million feet of booms have been deployed in an effort to protect precious estuaries and wildlife, even as thousands of barrels of crude oil continued gushing into the water. Drilling new wells to stop the flow would take a month or two, and it was unclear if the leak could be contained or slowed before then. WDSU: Rush to save Lake Pontchartrain . McKay said the company is building a containment system to prevent the leaking oil from spreading, but it may take another six to eight days to deploy it. Meanwhile, the company is working to battle the slick offshore and to clean up any oil that reaches the coast. ""We're still working hard, still working hard on the blowout preventer and see if we can actuate this piece of evidently failed equipment,"" he said. But he compared that to ""doing open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark with robot-controlled submarines."" Sen. Mary Landrieu and Rep. Charlie Melancon, both of Louisiana, said they want the government to put more pressure on BP to find a solution. ""Our government needs to get somewhere between 'drill, baby, drill' and 'spill, baby, spill,' "" Melancon said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Landrieu told the same program that the government should force BP to immediately start drilling remedial wells at the site ""and hope that one can fix this."" The slick has already taken a toll on life along the Gulf Coast, bringing fishing and tourism to a halt in many places and threatening to cripple those industries for weeks to come. ""I'm pretty much on pause right now. ... It's just a big waiting game,"" said David Boola, a fisherman who operates boat trips for tourists out of Venice. WDSU: Oil spill causes empty shrimp nets . Allen noted BP was deploying its top technology such as the remote operation vehicles, which the government doesn't have. At the same time, Napolitano and Salazar said the Obama administration had reacted quickly to what they called an escalating situation. Napolitano noted the incident was first an explosion and fire, with a search-and-rescue effort for missing rig workers. It then worsened when the rig sank two days later, followed by the increasing oil leak, she said. While BP was the first responder, the Coast Guard reacted right away to the situation and deployed 70 vessels and 1 million feet of boom for possible service, Napolitano said. Salazar noted that the Obama administration has ordered inspections of ""blowout preventers"" on other Gulf rigs. The government's job was to ""keep the boot on the neck"" of BP to ensure it meets its obligations in stopping the spill, dealing with the oil slick and paying for all costs and damages. Also on the CNN program Sunday, Florida's Republican Senate candidate Marco Rubio called the oil slick a ""crisis"" but withheld judgment on the administration's response. According to Rubio, it appeared that much of the early information provided to the federal government by BP had been ""either inaccurate or shortcoming."" In recent days, Rubio said, ""We've seen the administration move aggressively, and I hope aggressively enough."" BP partnered with government officials to hold town hall meetings throughout the region Saturday to respond to concerns about the spill's consequences. But Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal suggested the response to the oil slick has so far been inadequate. ""We continue to be concerned with BP's ability to respond to this incident,"" he said. Environmentalist Richard Charter of the Defenders of Wildlife organization said the oil leak could cause damage that would last decades. ""This event is a self-feeding fire,"" Charter said. ""It is so big and expanding so fast that it's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective. ""You're looking at a long-term poisoning of the area,"" he said. ""Ultimately, this will have a multidecade impact."" The oil spill started April 20, after an explosion on the BP contractor Transocean Ltd.'s Deepwater Horizon drilling platform. Eleven oil-rig workers remain missing and are presumed dead. The rig sank April 22 about 50 miles off the southeast coast of Louisiana, and the untapped wellhead is gushing oil into the Gulf of Mexico. About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said Saturday.","NEW: President Obama briefed on procedures used to cap well, impact of the spill .

86,"(CNN) -- A Maryland funeral home has lost its license after investigators found about 40 bodies stacked on top of each other, leaking fluid, in a garage, a state official said. The state Board of Morticians and Funeral Directors revoked the license of Chambers Funeral Home & Crematorium in Riverdale, Maryland after an April 26 visit to the site. Hari Close, president of the the state funeral board, told CNN Tuesday that some of the bodies were cadavers who had been donated to a local university for research. Other bodies came from other funeral homes, Close said. The bodies were supposed to be cremated, but investigators were alarmed at how they were stored in the garage while they awaited cremation. ""Even somebody who donates their body to science, they still should be treated with dignity,"" said Close. ""Not to mention the health and safety issues with the body fluids flowing out."" William Chambers, co-owner of the funeral home, told CNN-affiliate WJLA said that he hopes to work with the state to resolve the alleged violations. When investigators inspected the funeral home they were warned by an employee, who told them, ""Don't get upset about all the bodies in there,"" according to documents released by the state funeral board. Inside the room was a ""large pile, approximately 12 by 12 feet, of body bags containing human remains strewn on the floor of the garage in front of a removal van. There was visible leakage from the body bags as well as a pungent odor,"" the documents said. ""The investigator also observed writing on some of the body bags,"" they said. ""However, fluid leakage from the body bags caused the writing to smear and become illegible. As a result, it was not immediately possible to determine the identity of the remains."" There will be a hearing at the end of the month to determine whether the funeral home will get its license back, Close said. CNN's Patty Lane contributed to this report.","Investigators found about 40 bodies stacked atop each other awaiting cremation .

87,"Gulfport, Mississippi (CNN) -- Ben Stone knows quite a bit about disasters. Five years ago, a 28-foot storm surge from Hurricane Katrina flattened his house and almost wiped out his hometown of Gulfport, Mississippi. Now, if a rapidly growing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico comes ashore -- as some expect -- Stone will be able to see it from the front porch of his newly-built house. ""You can get mad about this,"" he said. ""I'm very disturbed about it."" Like residents along the coast of Alabama and Florida Panhandle, it is a waiting game for Gulfport. Already a heavy smell of oil hung over the Mississippi beaches. ""This could not have happened at a worse time in our history,"" said John Kelly, the town's chief administrative officer. The city has undertaken half a billion dollars in new construction since Katrina. Of that, $30 million is being spent on developing the harbor -- the third largest container port on the Gulf Coast. ""Well, it if it threatens the commercial sea lanes, that's a concern because if ships don't come in and ships aren't able to go out, that stops commerce,"" said Donald Allee, the CEO of Mississippi State Port Authority. Equipment operator Daniel Schepens knows all too well what that will mean. After Katrina, he was out of work for a month. He is worried the fallout from the spill could be worse. ""No ships, the warehouses are empty, no trucks, no imports, no exports,"" he said. Federal officials closed a portion of the northern Gulf of Mexico to fishing Sunday, curtailing a billion-dollar business as high winds and choppy seas hampered efforts to corral a rapidly growing oil spill. The spill cast a pall over the annual Blessing of the Fleet in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, one of many towns that make their living from the Gulf. Republican Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana attended a boat blessing in St. Bernard, Louisiana, where fishermen have observed the tradition for decades to usher in the shrimp season. ""Louisianians are resilient and understand that in times like these, it is our traditions that tie us closer together and provide the strength we need to face the challenges ahead,"" he said. ""This tragic oil spill has reminded everyone about the valuable connection between our residents and our wildlife, fisheries and coastline."" In Venice, Louisiana, a rain-spattered President Obama told reporters his administration has launched a ""relentless response"" to the spill, but said the problem might not be solved for ""many days."" A ruptured undersea well off Louisiana is spewing about 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of crude a day into the Gulf of Mexico, and efforts to shut off the flow have been unsuccessful since the late April explosion that sank the drill rig Deepwater Horizon. The leading edge of the slick has grown closer to the coast of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Adm. Thad Allen, the commandant of the Coast Guard, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the slick was still nine miles off the Louisiana coast, but seas of 6 to 10 feet have made deploying booms to fend the spill off the coast ""somewhat problematic."" Oil giant BP, which owns the well at the heart of the problem, said it had prepared massive boxes to be lowered over the leak points, but deploying them would take about a week. The minimum 10-day fishing restriction imposed Sunday by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration covers an area between the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana to the waters off Florida's Pensacola Bay. ""Balancing economic and health concerns, this order closes just those areas that are affected by oil,"" NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said in a statement announcing the decision. ""There should be no health risk in seafood currently in the marketplace."" The Gulf Coast's commercial fishing industry brings in about $2.4 billion to the region. Thomas Rodi, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Mobile, officiated at Sunday's event in Bayou La Batre and said the spill could have ""widespread effects"" on the area -- ""not only the livelihood of people, but an entire way of life."" Among those taking part in the blessing was Maurice Ryan, who said, ""You have to put your trust in someone."" ""I really feel like, with the church and the bishop, I've got my life in good hands,"" Ryan said. ""BP certainly isn't helping me."" The oil spill started April 20, after an explosion on BP contractor Transocean Ltd.'s Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that left 11 men presumed dead. About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said. ""This event is a self-feeding fire,"" said Richard Charter of the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. ""It is so big and expanding so fast that it's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective."" The spill will have ""a multidecade impact"" -- a ""long-term poisoning"" of the area, he said. Booms were strung across the mouths of delta estuaries in Louisiana and inlets along the Mississippi coast. In Alabama, National Guard troops helped lay them out off Dauphin Island, at the southern end of Mobile Bay. In Pascagoula, Mississippi, a steady stream of customers stocked up on bags of freshly boiled crawfish, oysters and shrimp. The weekend trade was good, but owner Keith Delcambre said he was worried about the future if the oil slick hits the coast. ""All I know is seafood,"" he said while sorting crawfish in a small workroom behind the kitchen. ""I don't know what we'll do if this hits. It feels like a hurricane is coming, but what can you do to stop oil?"" The cause of the blast on the Deepwater Horizon remains unknown. BP says a device known as a ""blowout preventer"" failed and has not responded to repeated attempts to activate it using remotely operated submarines. Frustration with BP was growing across the Gulf states, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has said the company's response has been inadequate. But BP America's president, Lamar McKay, told ABC's ""This Week"" that its focus ""is dealing with the source of the oil, dealing with it on the surface, and dealing with it on the beach or the marsh if it occurs."" McKay said the company has built a containment system to prevent the leaking oil from spreading. But it may take another six to eight days to deploy that system, which is made up primarily of massive boxes designed to capture the crude. BP spokeswoman Marti Powers said the company is trying to use remote-controlled submarines to shut off the well at the ocean floor, about 5,000 feet below the surface, and spreading dispersants on and under the water to break up the slick. The company has put out about 300,000 feet -- roughly 60 miles -- of floating booms to keep the oil away from ecologically sensitive shorelines, she said. But she said efforts to skim oil off the surface were put off because of bad weather. ""We're hampered because the weather is so bad. Some of the vessels can't get out,"" she said. ""So that slows us down a little bit. But they are still making the effort. We did get some photos back this morning that showed quite a bit of success."" CNN's David Mattingly, Brian Todd, Sarah Hoye, Mark Biello and Richard Lui contributed to this report.","Heavy smell of oil already hangs over Mississippi beaches .

88,"(CNN) -- The man credited with making Chicago's Metra commuter train line one of the best in the country is an apparent suicide, killed Friday by the train he himself rode five days a week for more than two decades. Shortly before 8 a.m., Phil Pagano drove to a parking lot about two miles from his home in unincorporated Crystal Lake in suburban Chicago, walked onto a track where someone had committed suicide three years ago and stepped in front of an oncoming Metra train, McHenry County Sheriff Keith Nygren told reporters. The train's lone engineer ""saw a man standing on the tracks turning and looking at the train,"" Nygren said. ""There was eye contact, he felt, between himself and the victim."" Pagano, Metra's executive director, made no attempt to step off the tracks, and the train, which was traveling between 45 mph and 55 mph, could not stop in time, Nygren said. None of the 27 people on the train was hurt. They included 24 passengers, two Metra employees, and the engineer, a Union Pacific employee. The passengers completed their trips in taxis; no other trains were delayed as a result of this incident, Nygren said. ""We have secured evidence at the scene and at the victim's residence that would indicate that this was an intentional act on his part,"" he said. A deputy on routine patrol came across the body within a minute of the incident, Nygren said. He described the scene as ""very gruesome."" Pagano's death came a week after Metra announced it was investigating whether the 60-year-old married father of two daughters got an unauthorized vacation payout last year of $56,000, said Metra spokeswoman Judy Pardonnet. It also came two hours before the Metra board was to have met to hear from an independent investigator about the allegation against Pagano, who was on paid administrative leave from his $269,000-per-year job. The meeting was delayed, Pardonnet said. She said the apparent suicide was out of character for a man who cared deeply for his job and his co-workers -- so much that he made sure train personnel received counseling after witnessing similar incidents. She credited her former boss with having transformed the Chicago rail system from one that in the 1980s was ""dilapidated and rundown"" to one that is now ""the top among commuter railroads."" ""This is a man who had an absolutely impeccable record and, honestly, was viewed as probably the premiere leader of commuter rail in the country."" Metra, for which Pagano had worked since its formation in 1984, moves 300,000 passengers per day along 11 lines over 550 miles of track serving six suburban communities in an area the size of Connecticut, she said. Before that, he held several positions at the Regional Transportation Authority in Illinois. On-time performance, according to Pardonnet, is routinely at or above 97 percent, the best of any major city in the country and a record that area residents have grown to count on. ""We literally get e-mails from people who say, 'My train was four minutes late twice this week, and I find that unacceptable,' "" Pardonnet said. ""He's had a fabulous and unprecedented career and that makes it even more tragic."" ""Phil served this agency with distinction for many years,"" Metra said in a written statement. ""Today, we shall remember the good work he achieved with our board of directors and the men and women of Metra. He was dedicated to our passengers and he always considered the men and women of Metra his family and there is a tremendous sense of loss within the agency."" Deputy Executive Director Bill Tupper was named appointed acting executive director of Metra, which after New York is the nation's second-largest commuter rail system, said Meg Reile, another Metra spokeswoman. The investigation was initiated after Metra officials received a tip from Greg Hinz, a reporter for Crain's Chicago Business, about the claim, Pardonnet said. ""Phil Pagano surely didn't go to work for Metra to grab money he wasn't entitled to,"" Hinz wrote Friday on his blog. ""Nor do reporters get into the news business to provoke suicides."" He added, ""I and others I've talked to who were involved in the matter are, frankly, rattled. Writing about this is part of my job, and the job needs to be done. But that doesn't mean you don't feel bad. I do. I am sorry it had to end this way.""","Phil Pagano made Chicago's Metra commuter train line one of best in country, many say .

89,"(CNN) -- A major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to cause substantial environmental damage along the Louisiana and Florida coastline. Here CNN's Jim Boulden explains the circumstances behind the leak and the consequences for oil giant BP as efforts to limit the disaster get underway. What caused the oil spill? It seems workers on the Transocean Deepwater Horizon drilling rig (not owned by BP) were attempting to cap this new exploratory well when it suffered a ""blow"" causing the fire and sinking of the rig and the rupture of the line which brings extracted oil to the shore. Investigators will want to see what caused the explosion. iReport: How is the oil spill affecting you? What are BP's offshore operations?  BP took over two big American oil companies in the 1990's, ARCO and AMOCO which gives BP access to many U.S. oil fields and refineries. There has been a slew of new oil and gas finds in the Gulf of Mexico in deep water. BP, like many of its competitors, is drilling exploration wells there to gauge the oil and gas potential. The well, known as Mississippi Canyon (MC) Block 252, is in the 'Macondo prospect'. The well in question is 65 percent owned by BP and has other oil companies as minority partners. It's the norm these days for competitors to invest in these speculative wells. Will BP have to foot the bill for the clean up?  BP CEO Tony Hayward has said BP will take full responsibility for the spill and that they will honor ""legitimate"" claims for compensation. In a press release Monday the company said: ""BP is committed to pay legitimate and objectively verifiable claims for other loss and damage caused by the spill - this may include claims for assessment, mitigation and clean up of spilled oil, real and property damage caused by the oil, personal injury caused by the spill, commercial losses including loss of earnings/profit and other losses as contemplated by applicable laws and regulations."" As of May 10, BP said the clean up has cost it $350 million which includes money for the failed dome, also a $100 million block grant to four states and $100 million to drill that relief well. Its not clear if BP has received any money from its partners Anadarko and Mitsui, which together control 35 percent of this particular project. BP is also expected to try and recover some costs from Swiss-based Transocean which own the rig that caught fire and sank. How much will all this cost? The clean up and the lawsuits together could total $3 billion, according to a research note Friday from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. But even that figure could be higher if the incident hits BP's reputation to the point where other firms no longer want to do business with them or if future oil exploration is limited as a result of the spill. Will anyone face legal action over the spill?  This is the United States after all. What effect has it had on BP's share price?  BP shares are like an oil tanker most days -- they don't move much and tend to trend with the oil price. But BP shares have been falling for days and at last count the company's shares have lost some 8 percent last week. Why does something like this impact on share price?  BP may have to spend billions of dollars to make this right. Also, BP could cut its very generous dividend to preserve cash, if it comes to that. The Texas City Refinery fire in 2005 has cost BP some $1.5bn and counting. Will it have an impact on BP's profits?  This was not a working well, so BP will not lose any amount of oil and gas in its portfolio. But at some point it will have to""'book"" the costs of all this and that will have an impact on its bottom line. Having said that, BP earns $5-7 billion from ""ongoing activities"" EVERY quarter ($27.7 billion in total for 2009). It had a $5.5 billion ""replacement cost"" profit in Q1 2010. It can afford this.","BP took over U.S. oil companies ARCO and AMOCO in the 90s .

90,"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Just days before his death, the Brooklyn, New York, middle-school student who died from an antibiotic-resistant staph infection had visited a hospital with skin lesions and was treated with allergy medicine, according to the family's lawyer, Paul Weitz. Omar Rivera, 12, a New York seventh-grader, died of drug-resistant staph on October 14. Omar Rivera's mother, Aileen, took the 12-year-old boy to Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn because she had been dissatisfied with the treatment he received at a clinic, Weitz told CNN. He said the hospital treated him with Benadryl, a common anti-allergy medicine. According to hospital spokeswoman Hope Mason, Omar did not show signs of a staph infection when he was treated at the hospital. ""I can confirm the child was brought to the emergency room after midnight on Friday, October 12. He was treated for non-MRSA-related conditions and was released,"" said Mason. ""We will be closely examining whether more could have been done to detect the infection at that time."" MRSA is short for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and is responsible for more deaths in the United States each year than AIDS, according to new data. The germ resists all but the most powerful antibiotics. Omar, a seventh-grader at Intermediate School 211, was pronounced dead on October 14 at Brookdale Hospital. Twenty-five to 30 percent of the population carry the staph bacteria -- one of the most common causes of infection -- in their bodies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While such infections are typically minor, invasive MRSA infections can become fatal, because they are caused by drug-resistant staph. E-mail to a friend .

91,"(CNN) -- Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger: On January 15, 2009, the airline captain, along with co-pilot Jeff Skiles, guided US Airways Flight 1549 into the Hudson River, saving the lives of all 155 people on board. In his autobiography, ""Highest Duty,"" the celebrated flier wrote that the landing was not a miracle, but rather the result of decades of practice and training. On Wednesday, Sullenberger, 59, announced his retirement. In the statement he released, he spoke of his passion for the profession, and he mentioned Skiles by name. He wrote, ""Each generation of pilots hopes that they will leave their profession better off than they found it. In spite of the best efforts of thousands of my colleagues, that is not the case today."" Sullenberger wrote that he would remain an advocate for aviation safety and for piloting. ""I will work to remind the entire industry -- and those who manage and regulate it - that we have a sacred duty to our passengers to do the very best that we know how to do."" Flight attendant Doreen Welsh, who served on Flight 1549 with Sullenberger, also announced her retirement from US Airways yesterday. Final flight for 'Sully' 'Miracle on Hudson' pilot retires . Whitney Thompson: California's Arnold Schwarzenegger, like many governors across the nation, faces severe budget problems. Schwarzenegger has called for ""draconian"" spending cuts to deal with a shortfall of nearly $20 billion. The state's public education system has been feeling the pain, and students and teachers are screaming loudly. Last fall, students held a series of protests on the UC Berkeley campus after the announcement last summer of a 32 percent tuition hike throughout the state's university system. Those protests grew into a movement, and Thursday, rallies, marches, demonstrations and teach-ins are scheduled across the state under a ""Day of Action"" banner. There are also protests planned in more than 30 other states to fight further budget cuts, layoffs and furloughs. Whitney Thompson, 23, from Yuma, Arizona, is a ""super-senior"" at Fresno State University. She plans to get her degree in history next fall. She is part of a statewide organization called Students for a Quality Education. Thompson will be speaking Thursday at a rally on the Fresno State campus. ""We're being denied access to quality affordable, education,"" she told CNN on Wednesday. It keeps worsening every year. We're paying more and getting less. They eliminated 1000 classes on my campus alone, including four I was enrolled in, and I had already paid for them. And then on top of that, I had to pay 32 percent more in tuition."" Students across U.S. plan to protest education funding cuts . Protests of tuition increase continue on California campuses . Patricia Overy: The 40-year-old accounting technician and mother of four announced Monday at the City of Lathrop, California, council meeting that she was voluntarily giving up her job. The Manteca Bulletin reported that Overy made the decision in order to save the job of a 60-year-old coworker, Sharon Singleton. The city's budget deficit is $648,000, and Overy told CNN Wednesday that 11 city jobs needed to be eliminated. She had long discussions with her husband, Robert, about her seven years at work and how close she had become with her coworkers. ""There are a lot of mothers with kids,"" she said. ""You know what their favorite crayon colors are. You talk about what you ate for dinner. I thought that I could possibly cope with the loss of a job better than my coworkers."" So her last day was Tuesday, and she's looking forward to spending time with her kids -- ages 14, 7 and 4-year-old twins -- before she looks for work again. ""I feel happy for what I did. I feel that I am so blessed,"" she said. ""I care about people, and that's how I was raised,"" she said. ""Everyday I live my life and think about what positive influence I could have. I'm not perfect, but I try to do my best."" Singleton's last day on her job would have been Thursday. The Manteca Bulletin: Worker's unselfish act . Matthew McCabe: Reps. Dana Rohrabacher, R-California, and Dan Burton, R-Indiana, will be joined at a news conference Thursday by accused Navy SEAL Matthew McCabe, as well as more than a dozen retired Navy SEALs, to renew calls for the exoneration of the ""Navy SEAL 3."" In September 2009, McCabe, Petty Officer 1st Class Julio Huertas and Petty Officer 2nd Class Jonathan Keefe were part of the SEAL team that captured and allegedly mistreated al-Qaeda leader Ahmed Hashim Abed, considered one of the most wanted terrorists in Iraq. Abed is the suspected planner behind the 2004 killing, burning and mutilation of four American contractors in Fallujah, Iraq. Abed complained to investigators that the SEALs punched him during his detention. There were arraigned in military court on charges of giving false statements to investigators and abusing Abed. In January, a judge ruled that Keefe and Huertas will have their cases heard in Iraq next month. Petty Officer 2nd Class McCabe, 24, faces a special court martial on May 3 at the naval base in Norfolk, Virginia. The case against the Navy SEALs sparked outrage that the sailors are being tried at all for handling a suspect in the contractors' murders, one of the most notorious incidents in the war. The killings got widespread news coverage when the burned bodies of two of the contractors were paraded through the streets of Fallujah and hanged from a bridge as their captors cheered. At today's news conference, Burton and Rohrabacher will present signed petitions of support from more than 100,000 Americans calling for the SEALs' exoneration. If found guilty, the SEALs face a maximum sentence of a year in a military prison, demotion to the lowest Navy rank, a cut in pay and a bad conduct discharge. Yesterday, McCabe's attorney, Neal Puckett, told CNN that his client is pleading not guilty. ""He continues routine training where he works in the Norfolk area. He's completely supported by the chain of command and all of the other SEALs. He's hoping for a good outcome,"" Puckett said. ""He's in good spirits and believes he'll be acquitted."" 2 Navy SEAL cases moved to Iraq . Jose Theodore: The goalie of the Washington Capitals hockey team talked for the first time this week to the Washington Post about the death of his 2-month-old son who died last August from respiratory complications. Chace Theodore was born five weeks early with a neuromuscular condition that has defied diagnosis. To breathe, he was put on a ventilator. Jose and his wife spent most of their son's 54 days at Washington Children's Hospital Center at a time when Jose was trying to win back his starting position with the Capitals. The newspaper reports that he had lost the position when he was replaced by a rookie last spring. Sports psychologist Joel Fish says that being a goalie requires ""the highest level of concentration and focus."" Theodore, an intensely private athlete, said, ""I can remember sometimes, it could be a 2-2 game, and you start thinking about your son, or you start thinking about different stuff."" After his son died, Theodore was named No. 1 goalie again, and he started a ""Saves for Kids"" campaign. He will donate $2 for each save, $100 for each win and $500 for each shutout during the regular season and more during playoffs to a children's medical center. The Washington Post: Washington Capitals goalie Jose Theodore copes with the pain of his infant son's death . What makes a person intriguing? There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did. They intrigue us.","'Miracle on Hudson' pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger retires .

92,"Washington (CNN) -- Congressional hearings into the massive oil spill growing in the Gulf of Mexico will start Tuesday, as winds continue to push the crude closer to the Mississippi Delta. BP America President Lamar McKay and Transocean President Steven Newman will appear before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the morning and then the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in the afternoon. BP leased from Transocean the oil rig that exploded off the Louisiana coast last month, starting the spill. Senators are expected to quiz McKay and Newman about the precautions taken before the blast that set off the underwater gusher and the steps being taken to stop the spill. Experts also are expected to testify on the possible impact of the spill on fishing, tourism and local economies. Also on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano plans to travel to Mobile, Alabama, ""to inspect ongoing operations to minimize the Deepwater BP Oil Spill's impact on public health, the environment and the economy,"" the Deepwater Horizon Joint Information Center said in a statement. Napolitano and Alabama Gov. Bob Riley plan to talk with reporters late Tuesday afternoon, the center said. A change in the weather could push more oil from BP's Deepwater Horizon site into the Mississippi Delta region and areas west of the river, according to Gov. Bobby Jindal, who called the development ""bad news for Louisiana."" Louisiana has been mostly spared since the oil rig exploded April 20 and sank two days later about 50 miles off the southeast coast of Louisiana. The catastrophe is sending 210,000 gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico each day. Most of the slick has been centered in an area east of the environmentally sensitive delta. ""We've said all along that the oil coming west of the river would pose a whole new set of challenges,"" Jindal said at a Monday news conference. He detailed efforts to place booms and other restraining devices into four passes near Grand Isle to prevent the oil from reaching land. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters had warned over the weekend that the Mississippi Delta and areas to the northeast of it -- including Breton Sound, the Chandeleur Islands and the mainland behind them -- could see oil hit the coast by Tuesday. So far, the spill has had little impact on wildlife, said Mark J. Musaus, deputy director of the Southeast region for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Only a few birds have been taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center at Fort Jackson, Louisiana, he said. Two of them, a gannet and a pelican, were released Monday back into the wild. Another oiled pelican was still in the treatment center, as was a green heron, he said. The stakes are high for residents of coastal Louisiana who make their living from fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. The government has closed parts of the Gulf to fishing. The affected area, which is east of the Mississippi Delta, comprises about 4.5 percent of the Gulf of Mexico, NOAA said. Hundreds of thousands of feet of boom and large volumes of dispersants continued to be deployed in an effort to capture or break up the spilled oil moving toward the Gulf coastline. Thousands of workers and volunteers also have been skimming the water's surface.","Presidents of BP, Transocean to appear before two Senate committees Tuesday .

93,"(CNN) -- At least five people were killed in Oklahoma on Monday after a severe storm system spawned multiple tornadoes across the state, the state emergency management department said. Three people died in Cleveland County, just west of Tecumseh, Oklahoma, said Albert Ashwood, director of the state emergency management department, and another was reported dead near Choctaw, east of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The location in Oklahoma of the fifth person who died was unknown late Monday night. Brenda Finkle, director of corporate communications for Norman Regional Health System, said the company's hospital in Norman admitted eight patients Monday night in critical condition with crush injuries and head trauma. At least 25 other people filled the waiting room of Norman Regional Hospital with lacerations and head wounds, Finkle said, adding hospital staff expected more patients to continue to seek treatment. Another 20 people were either getting medical care or awaiting treatment at Moore Medical Center, just north of Norman, according to Finkle. OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, received two patients with broken bones, according to spokesman Allen Poston. The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management reported seven injuries. Video out of Norman showed overturned cars, snapped utility poles, downed trees and severely damaged homes. Several mobile homes were blown to pieces in one neighborhood where debris littered yards and streets alongside large trees ripped straight from the ground. A truck stop east of Oklahoma City was demolished, taking a direct hit from one of the tornadoes, according to a spokeswoman for Love's Travel Stops and Country Stores. Motorists pulled off Interstate 40 and sought shelter in the truck stop's large coolers and restrooms before the tornado tore the roof off the building, blew out car windows and overturned tractor-trailers, spokeswoman Christina Dukeman said. Video showed people outside the truck stop receiving treatment for minor injuries. Laura O'Leary, a spokeswoman for the Emergency Medical Services Authority, said seven people were transported from around the immediate area to local hospitals in good and fair condition, ""a miraculously low number ... considering the volume of area the tornado covered."" Love's employee Charlescie Greenway said she and two other women made it to one cooler before the twister tore through the building. ""The three of us were kind of trapped in there, holding the door shut, praying to God that we don't die and that everybody else was safe,"" Greenway told CNN affiliate KWTV, adding, ""it was really scary -- the wind was like trying to pull the door off the latch."" Sammy Ward and his partner rode the twister out in their truck in the parking lot. ""It started hailing and then it quit hailing and then all of a sudden the wind hit and it just went dark and here went everything,"" Ward told KWTV. ""Trucks went to rocking ... and next thing we know the whole roof and everything was gone."" Ward, who said he felt ""very lucky,"" said the event lasted two to three minutes. Ashwood said crews were working to assess the damages in at least 13 counties, adding ""numerous"" homes had been affected. Are you there? Send photos, video . The American Red Cross opened at least two shelters in McCloud, Oklahoma, and Tecumseh, Oklahoma, and continued to assess needs across the state. More than 31,000 homes were without power in the metro Oklahoma City area -- nearly 15,000 in Norman alone, according to Oklahoma Gas & Electric. Ashwood said preliminary reports out of Norman indicate the damages are ""similar to what you would see with an EF3"" tornado, referring to the Enhanced Fujita Scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes. An EF3 is capable of producing winds up to 165 mph. CNN iReporter Rebecca Barbato said tornado sirens were going off in her neighborhood in Moore, just north of Norman, when tennis-ball-sized hail began raining down on her roof. Other tornadoes were reported in Yukon, Medford and Shawnee in Oklahoma, and in Wichita, Kansas. The storms struck around 5 p.m. CT (6 p.m. ET). Meteorologists warned throughout the day Monday of the potential for tornadoes. CNN's Devon Sayers and Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report.","NEW: At least five killed in Oklahoma .

94,"(CNN) -- Ash from an Icelandic volcano is continuing to affect European flights on Monday, delaying transatlantic aircraft and threatening flights over parts of Ireland and Portugal. Eurocontrol, the agency that manages European air travel, said: ""During the afternoon, areas of higher ash concentration could move in a north-easterly direction from the Atlantic into the Iberian Peninsula."" Ryanair, the budget airline, canceled 18 flights on Monday as it expected the airspace surrounding Kerry airport in the southwest of Ireland and Faro airport in Portugal to be affected by the ash cloud. Ryanair said in a statement on its Web site: ""Passengers are strongly recommended to check their flight status before they go to the airport."" Eurocontrol said much of the high-concentration ash cloud over continental Europe had dispersed and that despite the delays, all European airports were open on Monday afternoon. The UK Civil Aviation Authority said that transatlantic flights were still rerouting around ash that was lying between 20,000 to 35,000 feet in the atmosphere. A CAA spokesman told CNN: ""The ash cloud is slowly disappearing, it's descending and dispersing, there isn't one big cloud... it's ash in the air over a very large area. Transatlantic flights are rerouting around it, causing delays."" Eurocontrol said it expected approximately 28,500 flights within the European area, which is about 500 below average for a Monday at this time of year. Italian airports in Milan, Pisa and Florence as well as six airports in Scotland were closed over the weekend because of the ash cloud. Volcanic ash can be a serious hazard to aircraft, reducing visibility, damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail. The problems began in mid-April, when the volcano beneath the Eyjafjallajokull glacier in southern Iceland erupted and sent a cloud of ash into the atmosphere, closing most of Europe's airspace for six days.","Eurocontrol: Ash from Icelandic volcano could affect Irish and Portuguese airspace .

95,"(CNN) -- Giant rocks came tumbling down a snowy Colorado mountainside early Monday, punching gaping holes in the interstate below, the Colorado Department of Transportation said. The rock slide at Glenwood Canyon halted travel on Interstate 70 between Glenwood Springs and Dotsero, about 18 miles east, according to the department. Glenwood Springs is about 120 miles west of Denver. It is unclear when construction crews will complete enough work to open at least part of the roadway. About 20 boulders struck the interstate shortly after midnight, the transportation department said. They ranged from 3 feet to 10 feet in diameter, with the largest weighing an estimated 66 tons, the department said on its Web site. About eight holes or dips were left on the interstate. Road underwiring was exposed and rock crumbles surrounded the damage, the department said. The largest hole measured 20 feet by 10 feet -- bigger than a full-size SUV. Rocks were scattered over a 100-yard stretch of the road. A steel guard rail and median barrier were also damaged. The damage resembles a major rock slide in the area back in 2004, the department said.","Rock slide at Glenwood Canyon halts travel on I-70 between Glenwood Springs and Dotsero .

96,"(CNN) -- Oklahoma's governor Tuesday declared states of emergency in 56 counties following a string of deadly tornadoes and severe storms that swept through the area the day before. Gov. Brad Henry took an aerial tour of one of the hardest hit areas Tuesday afternoon. ""I lost track of the number of damaged and destroyed homes that we saw,"" Henry said. ""Literally hundreds and I think thousands of homes have received damage in these storms, and many, many of those homes have been destroyed."" Are you there? Send images, video . ""Even though central Oklahoma was the hardest hit, this storm really was a statewide event, and there is damage and destruction throughout the state,"" he said. The governor said that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano assured him ""that FEMA would act very, very quickly on our request for a presidential disaster (declaration) and federal aid."" Meanwhile, a maze of downed power lines and wrecked homes in parts of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, hindered search-and-rescue efforts Tuesday as authorities worked to ensure no more victims of Monday's tornadoes lay in the rubble. The state Department of Emergency Management lowered its death toll from five to two, saying that three children had been erroneously reported dead. The children are in critical condition, the state said. Their mother was one of the two dead. More than 100 people were treated for various injuries, the state said. Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett said 80 homes and businesses in the city were destroyed by the storm, which he called ""probably the most significant"" to hit during his seven years in office. The storm system that swept through the state on Monday spawned multiple tornadoes and dropped softball-sized hail. More bad weather was on the way Tuesday, and the National Weather Service warned Oklahomans to prepare for severe storms Tuesday afternoon and early evening. Tornado watch in western Oklahoma . Officials said they planned to release more detailed damage estimates Tuesday and decide how to manage cleanup efforts in areas where tornadoes left behind snapped utility poles, downed trees and severely damaged homes. In Norman, Oklahoma, south of Oklahoma City, mobile homes were blown to pieces in one neighborhood, where debris littered yards and streets alongside large trees ripped straight from the ground. Watch iReport video of tornado in Norman, Oklahoma . Norman resident and CNN iReporter Erica Loftis said she spotted the funnel cloud from Interstate 40 while headed to her parents' home and could see it headed toward the home when she arrived. She and her parents took shelter in a small cement room with steel doors, where they could feel their ears popping and hear the storm ripping away parts of the house around them. ""You could feel the pressure - it was scary,"" Loftis said. Outside, the sound of ""screeching metal"" filled the air, she said. Afterward, all the home's windows were broken, its chimney was blown into a neighbor's yard and the garage door was sucked in. In addition, a boat from a nearby marine store ended up in one of their trees, she said. And a truck stop east of Oklahoma City was demolished, taking a direct hit from one of the tornadoes, according to a spokeswoman for Love's Travel Stops and Country Stores. But motorists who pulled off the interstate to take cover were ushered into the truck stop's large coolers and restrooms before the tornado tore the roof off the building, blew out car windows and overturned tractor-trailers, spokeswoman Christina Dukeman said. Love's employee Charlescie Greenway said she and two other women made it to one cooler before the twister hit. ""The three of us were kind of trapped in there, holding the door shut, praying to God that we don't die and that everybody else was safe,"" Greenway told CNN affiliate KWTV, adding, ""it was really scary -- the wind was like trying to pull the door off the latch."" Cornett said quick thinking by the truck stop's employees saved people inside. ""They were all huddled into a cooler and all walked out alive,"" he said. More than 65,000 homes and businesses were without power throughout the state, emergency management officials said. Nearly 15,000 homes were without power in Norman alone, according to Oklahoma Gas & Electric. The Lake Draper Water Treatment Plant, which provides about half of Oklahoma City's water, was also without power, City Manager Jim Couch said. Because of the outage, city officials placed a ban on outside watering for 48 hours, he said. ""It's unknown when that power will be restored,"" he said. ""Major transmission lines in the area have been damaged."" State emergency officials said more than 100 homes were destroyed and another 70 sustained major damage. Additionally, 43 businesses were destroyed. CNN's Tyson Wheatley contributed to this report.","NEW: State officials lower death toll from five to two .

97,"Kenner, Louisiana (CNN) -- A ""black rain"" of drilling fluid and a roar of escaping gas erupted from the doomed Deepwater Horizon shortly before the explosion that sank the oil rig, the captain of a nearby ship testified Tuesday. Alwin Landry's supply vessel Damon Bankston was alongside Deepwater Horizon at the time of the blast. Landry said the first sign of trouble was when drilling ""mud"" -- a mixture used to pressurize and lubricate the drills -- began falling onto the stern of his ship. ""We essentially closed the wheelhouse doors. I went to the port side, and I looked out up at the derrick. That's when I see the mud coming out of the top of the derrick,"" Landry told investigators Tuesday. When he radioed the rig's bridge, Landry said, its captain told him there were problems with the well and he should move his ship away. Seconds later, he said, he heard ""the percussion and the slight flash of green"" of an explosion. Deepwater Horizon sank April 22, two days after the explosion. The blast left 11 people aboard the rig presumed dead and uncorked a gusher of oil that has been spewing an estimated 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of crude oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico. Landry's testimony came on the first of two days of hearings by a joint Coast Guard-Interior Department panel. His ship picked up the rig's survivors, and Landry said the rig's captain, Curt Kutcha, told him he had tried to activate a ""kill switch"" that would cut off the well before abandoning the structure. The crew did not know whether it was working when they fled the burning rig, Landry told investigators. The federal Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department agency that oversees offshore oil exploration, inspects drill rigs once a month, MMS inspector Eric Neal told the panel. Test results from the rig's blowout preventer, a massive device meant to cut off the well in an emergency, and drilling mud weights are reviewed as part of that process, he said. Neal inspected the rig April 1 and found no violations, he testified. But he did not inspect the preventer's emergency disconnect system, he said. The companies involved in the drilling process are blaming each other for the disaster. The chairman of well owner BP's American subsidiary, Lamar McKay, told a U.S. Senate committee Tuesday that rig owner/operator Transocean was responsible for the rig's operation and for testing its blowout preventer. But Transocean CEO Steven Newman told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that the well's cementing, or the casing that holds the well in place, must have failed. BP, as the well's owner, was responsible for designing the casing, while oilfield services contractor Halliburton performed the cementing. ""Without a failure of one of those elements, the explosion could not have occurred,"" Newman said. And Halliburton's chief safety and environmental officer, Tim Probert, told the committee that responsibility lay with either Transocean or BP. During the cementing of the well, Halliburton simply followed BP's instructions, he said, and the blowout preventer was Transocean's responsibility.","Alwin Landry's supply vessel was alongside Deepwater Horizon at time of blast .

98,"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The bitter standoff between government troops and Red Shirt protesters in downtown Bangkok worsened Friday, the day after the wounding of a key protest leader aggravated the already deep tensions permeating the Thai capital. Hospital officials reported 16 people died in confrontations Friday in Bangkok, an urban fortress under siege and beset by gunfire, tear gas and stone-throwing. That followed the death of one person Thursday. The unrest boiled over after Thai authorities set a new deadline to seal off the Bangkok intersection where protesters have gathered by the thousands for the past month. In addition to the deaths, more than 140 people were wounded in the violence, including four non-Thais -- a Pole, a Canadian, a Liberian and a Myanmarese. A government official said Thai forces were slowly getting control of the downtown area, with video footage showing soldiers shooting rounds toward the area with protesters. Among those wounded on Friday was a journalist from a French television station who was shot in the leg. What are protests about? The government said it was forced to take action after demonstrators disregarded an ultimatum by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to vacate the intersection by Wednesday. Panitan Wattanayagorn, the acting government spokesman, said on Friday security forces who have been the objects of attacks have no choice but to respond. He told reporters that forces have been dutifully following the rules of engagement, which allows them to use live ammunition to protect themselves and their comrades. He assured Bangkok residents and foreigners there that the forces have no intention of harming anyone. The government, he said, is ""very confident"" it will be able to ""stabilize the situation"" and get it ""under control very soon."" Also, he said the prime minister is looking forward to working with others in hammering out reforms. The United Front for Democracy, the formal name of the Red Shirt opposition, has been demanding that Abhisit dissolve the lower house of Parliament and call new elections. The Red Shirts support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup. Tensions ramped up when Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawasdipol -- a renegade general better known as Seh Daeng, which means Red Commander -- was shot and wounded by a sniper's bullet on Thursday, an action that left him in critical condition. Seh Daeng was shot in the head while being interviewed by journalists in makeshift barricades set up by protesters. Thomas Fuller of The New York Times told CNN that the opposition leader was looking at him and answering questions when ""the bullet hit him in the forehead, from what I could tell."" Reporter: Bullet 'felt like it grazed my head' ""It looks like the bullet came over my head and struck him. I don't have any way of confirming this beyond what I remember from the scene, but it felt like it grazed my head,"" he said. Fuller, who said bamboo pikes and rubber tire barricades have been formed as a makeshift encampment by the protesters, said the opposition figure was facing out of the barricades and into Bangkok's business district of tall office buildings. ""He was standing in the same location for a while when I was talking to him but he was moving around, he was gesticulating,"" Fuller said. ""He wasn't standing still, he was bobbing his head."" iReport: Are you there? Send your images, video . Seh Daeng did not appear to be armed or have bodyguards, but was dressed in camouflage jacket and a floppy hat, Fuller said. Seh Daeng is a controversial public figure, even within the protest movement, Fuller said. Some Thai opposition leaders see him as an impediment to a peaceful resolution to the political stalemate that has gripped Thai politics, the reporter said. ""He's a renegade in sort of all senses,"" Fuller said. ""He's a renegade from the army, a hardliner within the protest movement. He told me today he thought they (other opposition leaders) were being cowardly and he wanted to carry on.""","NEW: Hospitals say 16 people have been killed in Bangkok violence .

99,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- BP will try again within the next day to cap a well that has gushed millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, the energy company said Friday. The latest attempt will involve inserting a tube into a ruptured pipe, collecting oil and sending it to a vessel on the surface, said Mark Proegler, a BP spokesman. The insertion tube was on the sea floor, and engineers planned to move it into place later in the day, Proegler said. The company has lowered a smaller containment dome for use if the insertion tube does not stem the flow of oil into the water, Proegler said. But Adm. Thad Allen, commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, said twice Friday that the containment dome, referred to as a ""top hat,"" was the first choice, followed by the insertion tube. Officials could not explain the discrepancy. Neither procedure would be a permanent solution, Allen said Friday in Mississippi. The procedures, he said, ""will reduce the leakage, not stop the leakage."" The ultimate solution, Allen said, will be achieved by relief wells that are being drilled near the leak site. Those will take weeks, if not months, to complete, BP has said. After much discussion over whether the use of subsea dispersants could cause ecological damage, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said Friday that officials have concluded that it ""is an option we can consider and will move ahead with."" The decision was made after the results of three tests were analyzed, she said. ""This is not a decision that was made lightly, but it is a series of tradeoffs. You're really trying to minimize the impact on the environment as best as possible."" Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production, said the company has spent more than $450 million responding to the spill and that more than 14,000 people are involved in the effort. To date, more than 1.2 million feet of boom have been deployed and another 400,000 feet of boom have been staged for deployment, he said. In all, the company is trying to accumulate 3.5 million feet of boom. The forecast this weekend and early next week ""looks very favorable to use all tools,"" he said, citing burning, skimming operations and use of surface and subsurface dispersants. Suttles said the spill has had ""limited impact"" on shore, with oil being found in four locations in Louisiana, two in Alabama and one in Mississippi. In Washington, President Barack Obama criticized executives from BP and two other companies for blaming each other for the catastrophe. ""It is absolutely essential that, going forward, we put in place every necessary safeguard and protection so that a tragedy like this oil spill does not happen again,"" Obama said after meeting Friday with Cabinet members to discuss the spill. Read about oil spill responses . ""This is a responsibility that all of us share,"" Obama said. ""The oil companies share it. The manufacturers of this equipment share it. The agencies in the federal government in charge of oversight share that responsibility. I will not tolerate more finger-pointing or irresponsibility."" BP's efforts to plug the leak come amid growing concern that the company has been low-balling how much oil has poured out of the well. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, sent BP a letter Friday asking for details from federal agencies about the methods they are using to analyze the oil leak. Markey, who chairs a congressional subcommittee on energy and the environment, said he would launch a formal inquiry after learning of independent estimates that are significantly higher than the amount BP officials have provided. ""The public needs to know the answers to very basic questions: how much oil is leaking into the Gulf and how much oil can be expected to end up on our shores and our ocean environment?"" Markey said in a letter to BP. ""I am concerned that an underestimation of the flow may be impeding the ability to solve the leak and handle management of the disaster."" Track the oil spill . BP has said since the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drill rig that about 5,000 barrels -- or 210,000 gallons -- have been pouring out of the well a day. The company says it reached that number using data, satellite images and consultation with the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""I think that's a good range,"" Suttles said Friday. But a researcher at Purdue University said BP's estimate is low. Associate Professor Steve Wereley said that about 70,000 barrels of oil are leaking each day, based on an analysis of video of the spill. ""You can't say with precision, but you can see there's definitely more coming out of that pipe than people thought,"" he said. ""It's definitely not 5,000 barrels a day."" A BP executive rejected that assertion Friday. ""Well, that's not what our experts, multiple experts, not only from BP, and the industry say,"" said Bob Dudley, BP managing director for the Americas and Asia. ""This crude is what's called a light-sweet crude. It has lots of gas and when it comes out, it expands very rapidly, a little bit like bubbles in a soda pop. So it's very difficult to look at it and say that the volume will be much higher. We certainly don't see that at the surface."" The dispute over the size of the leak caps a week in which congressional committees grilled executives from BP and two other companies: drilling contractor Transocean Ltd., which owned the rig, and oilfield services contractor Halliburton, which was responsible for cementing the well shut once drilled. The companies blamed each other. BP pointed to Transocean, which said BP was responsible for the wellhead's design and Halliburton was responsible for the cement finishing work. Halliburton, in turn, said its workers were just following BP's orders, but that Transocean was responsible for maintaining the rig's blowout preventer. iReport: Send your photos, videos . Obama took exception Friday. ""I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle during the congressional hearings into this matter,"" the president said. ""You had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else. The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't."" Obama said the federal government also was taking responsibility for its role. ""For too long, for a decade or more, there's been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill,"" Obama said. ""It seems as if permits were too often issued based on little more than assurances of safety from the oil companies. ""That cannot and will not happen anymore. To borrow an old phrase, we will trust, but we will verify."" As a result, Obama said, the Mineral Management Service will be restructured, with the part of the agency that permits oil and gas drilling and collects royalties separated from the part of the agency in charge of inspecting the safety of oil rigs and platforms and enforcing the law. ""That way, there's no conflict of interest, real or perceived,"" Obama said. In addition, Obama said, the administration has ordered immediate inspections of all deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico, and no drilling permits will be issued until a 30-day safety-and-environmental review is completed. Obama also announced a new examination of the environmental procedures for oil and gas exploration and development. Learn more about efforts to stop the leak . BP, the Coast Guard and state and local authorities have scrambled to keep the oil from reaching shore or the ecologically delicate coastal wetlands off Louisiana. They have burned off patches of the slick, deployed more than 280 miles of protective booms, skimmed as much as 4 million gallons of oily water off the surface of the Gulf and pumped more than 400,000 gallons of chemical dispersants onto the oil. On Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration closed off to fishing another part of the Gulf of Mexico over which the federal government has jurisdiction. NOAA has now closed 19,377 square miles (50,187 square kilometers), which is 8 percent of the Gulf area within 200 miles of the coast, called an exclusive economic zone. The closed area a week earlier had been 4.5 percent. Investigators are still trying to determine what caused the April 20 explosion at the rig, which sank two days later. Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead. CNN's Eric Fiegel, Brian Todd and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","NEW: Subsea dispersants 'an option we ... will move ahead with'

100,"(CNN) -- Much of the Central Plains and Midwest braced for another day of potentially severe weather as residents of Oklahoma cleaned up from a deadly outbreak of tornadoes this week. The National Weather Service said severe thunderstorms were possible Wednesday across large sections of Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, as well as parts of Arkansas, Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, forecast an outbreak of powerful thunderstorms in the late afternoon and into the evening -- some with large hail. The deadly storm system that swept through Oklahoma on Monday spawned multiple tornadoes and dropped softball-sized hail. Two people died and more than 100 people were treated for various injuries, the state Department of Emergency Management reported. Gov. Brad Henry took an aerial tour of one of the hardest hit areas Tuesday afternoon. ""I lost track of the number of damaged and destroyed homes that we saw,"" Henry said. ""Literally hundreds and, I think, thousands of homes have received damaged in these storms, and many, many of those homes have been destroyed. ""Even though central Oklahoma was the hardest hit, this storm really was a statewide event, and there is damage and destruction throughout the state,"" he said. The governor said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano assured him ""that FEMA would act very, very quickly on our request for a presidential disaster (declaration) and federal aid."" iReport: Are you there?

101,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- A mechanical problem prevented BP from inserting a tube into a ruptured pipe that would help siphon off oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico, BP official Doug Suttles said Saturday. Suttles said the device was hoisted back to the surface Friday for readjustments and the company expects to have it working by Saturday night. The plan is for the mile-long tube to collect the oil and send it to a surface vessel. Millions of gallons of crude have gushed into the Gulf since the fiery explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig more than three weeks ago. Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production, cautioned that the method is designed to contain  the flow, not stop it. The tactic was dealt a setback Friday night when the frame holding the insertion tube shifted and prevented the surface vessel from connecting to it, Suttles said. Meanwhile, Suttles said the application of underwater dispersants -- a tactic approved for use Friday -- ""appears"" to be working. ""The oil in the immediate vicinity of the well and the ships and rigs working in the area is diminished from previous observations,"" he said after flying over the area Saturday. He did not provide further details. What are oil dispersants? The Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the decision to use subsea dispersants is an ""important step"" at reducing potential damage from the spill, because dispersant can be more effective underwater than on the ocean's surface. Oil dispersants are chemicals that can break the oil down into small drops and prevent it from reaching the surface or the shore. Dispersants are generally less harmful than the oil itself, which is highly toxic, and they biodegrade more quickly, the Coast Guard said. The underwater gusher began after an April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon. The explosion and subsequent fire caused the Deepwater Horizon to sink two days later, prompting oil to begin spilling from the well. BP was leasing the rig from Transocean. On Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security released a letter from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar addressed to BPchief executive Anthony Hayward, calling on the company to state its ""true intentions"" for compensating those affected by the spill. ""The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill may prove to be one of the most devastating environmental disasters this nation has ever faced,"" said the letter, which was dated Friday. ""As one of the responsible parties for this event, BP is accountable to the American public for the full clean-up of this spill and all the economic loss caused by the spill and related events."" What can BP do to combat growing oil spill? The letter also asks BP to confirm it will not ""seek reimbursement from the American taxpayers, the United States government or the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for any amount.""

102,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Investigators had a ""significant break"" in tracking the salmonella outbreak when they found the bacteria on a jalapeño pepper imported from Mexico at a Texas food supplier, the Food and Drug Administration announced Monday. The FDA has discouraged all consumers from eating raw jalapeño peppers. The FDA also warned consumers not to eat fresh jalapeños and products made with fresh jalapeños. The discovery may provide a clue to the source of a recent outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul. The bacteria have sickened more than 1,200 people in 42 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    ""One of the jalapeño peppers has tested positive with a genetic match to the Saintpaul strand,"" said Robert Tauxe, deputy director of the CDC's Division of Foodborne, Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases. Consumer Tips Blog: Hold the jalapeños  He said officials are ""looking at the chain that the peppers would have passed through to decide if any of them are a point of contamination.""   Watch more on the salmonella outbreak »  Tauxe called the discovery a ""significant break.""   ""While this one sample does not give us the whole story, this genetic break is very important,"" he said. ""This will hopefully help us pinpoint the source of this outbreak."" The bacteria were found at a distribution center in McAllen, Texas, and the distributor has agreed to recall the products. Although the pepper was grown on a farm in Mexico, Tauxe said, investigators are not yet certain where the bacteria originated.  Read food safety tips »  ""This does not mean that the pepper was contaminated in Mexico,"" he said. ""We aren't only looking for the source, but the reason for the spread [of the outbreak]."" The news comes just days after the FDA lifted its ban on consumption of certain raw tomatoes. The FDA has not ruled out tomatoes as the source of the original outbreak, but investigators have determined that tomatoes currently in fields and stores are safe, Dr. David Acheson, the FDA's associate commissioner for food protection, said Thursday.

103,"(CNN) -- The 9-year-old boy who was the lone survivor of a plane crash that killed 103 people in Libya plans to return to the Netherlands on Saturday, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said Friday. He is scheduled to leave Tripoli, Libya, at 10 a.m. Saturday and fly home with an aunt and uncle, as well as a doctor, the ministry said in a statement. Ruben van Assouw suffered multiple fractures to his legs and underwent surgery at Al Khadra Hospital, said a doctor who declined to give her name. Both of Ruben's parents and a brother were killed in the crash, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said. Acting on a request from the boy's relatives, authorities do not plan to say where the plane will land, and the media will not be present when it does, the ministry statement said. ""His relatives have appealed to the media to exercise restraint and to leave Ruben and his family in peace at this difficult time,"" it said. Authorities said Ruben was the only survivor after an Afriqiyah Airways plane crashed at 6 a.m. Wednesday. The boy's aunt and uncle arrived in Tripoli to visit him Thursday. Saif al Islam Gadhafi, the second eldest son of Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, visited the boy in the hospital along with airline chairman Capt. Sabri Shadi, according to a statement on Afriqiyah Airways' website. More than two thirds of the passengers killed in the plane crash were Dutch, the foreign ministry said. Passengers from Libya, South Africa, Belgium, Austria, Germany, France, Zimbabwe and Britain were also among the victims, the airline said on its website. The plane, an Airbus A330-200, departed Johannesburg, South Africa, and was at the end of its nearly nine-hour flight when it crashed. Officials recovered the plane's flight data recorder, but investigators are still trying to determine what caused the crash. CNN's Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.","NEW: Ruben van Assouw, 9, will fly home to the Netherlands on Saturday .

104,"(Health.com) -- People who take vitamin E supplements regularly for years -- whether they are smokers or nonsmokers -- may lower their risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the lung condition that is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. COPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is often, but not always, caused by smoking. While the risk reduction is relatively small, 10 percent, COPD is a common and life-threatening condition in which a decline in lung function can be slowed down but not reversed. COPD symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing, and fatigue. ""The effect appears to be modest. But for something for which there isn't really any effective therapy and tends to be a degenerative condition, anything that would reduce the risk even somewhat is not an insubstantial benefit,"" says Jeffrey B. Blumberg, Ph.D., a professor of nutrition at Tufts University in Boston who was not involved in the study. The research, from the government-funded Women's Health Study, included 39,876 women 45 years and older who were free of COPD before they were randomly assigned to take a placebo, vitamin E supplements (600 IU every other day) or aspirin (100 mg per day), either alone or in combination. At the end of 10 years, 760 of the 19,937 women who took vitamin E alone or with aspirin developed COPD compared with 846 of the 19,939 who took a placebo or aspirin alone -- a 10 percent risk reduction. Vitamin E did not lower the risk of asthma, a condition associated with a higher risk of COPD. Health.com: 10 ways to have cleaner air at home . The researchers took into account factors such as cigarette smoking and age, which can affect COPD risk. The study, conducted by Cornell University and Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers, is to be presented this week at the annual American Thoracic Society meeting in New Orleans. The idea that vitamin E can reduce the risk of developing COPD is ""biologically plausible,"" says Yvonne Kelly, Ph.D., an associate professor in the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London. Experts believe vitamins A, C, and E -- the so-called ACE antioxidants -- combat oxidative stress in the lungs that can lead to COPD. Health.com: Eight causes of a chronic cough . Several studies have shown that these vitamins, as well as vitamin D, may help improve lung health. In a 2003 study, Kelly and her collaborators found that men and women with diets high in vitamins C and E had greater lung capacity and produced less phlegm, respectively. Phlegm production and wheezing are also COPD symptoms. One limitation of the study is that the researchers relied on the women to report whether or not they had a diagnosis of COPD, says Michael Sims, M.D., an assistant professor in the pulmonary critical care division at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. He points out that people with asthma may think they have COPD, or vice versa, since the symptoms are similar. In addition, early diagnoses can be inconclusive or due to lung problems that don't turn out to be COPD. Health.com: How to buy the right air cleaner . In future studies, Sims says that the researchers should diagnose COPD using a breathing test called spirometry. ""If you showed in a similar study with a gold standard outcome [like spirometry], among smokers and nonsmokers, that you could affect the incidence of COPD, I would imagine the committees that meet on this would take a serious look at increasing daily recommended intake [of vitamin E] for the general population,"" he says. Currently, no vitamin supplements are recommended to prevent or treat COPD. The best way to prevent the disease is to quit smoking, says Dr. Sims. About 24 million people in the U.S. have COPD -- 12 million who've been diagnosed with the disease and another 12 million who have COPD but don't know they have it. In the study, women who smoked were four times more likely than nonsmokers to develop COPD. Health.com:12 best COPD blogs and Web sites . The daily recommended intake of vitamin E is about 22 international units for those 14 and older, and is relatively easy to obtain from oils such as sunflower, almonds, peanut butter, and spinach. The vitamin E intake in the study was far higher, at 300 IU per day. However, Blumberg says this is within the range of most over-the-counter vitamin supplements, which deliver 100 or 400 IU daily. ""This study is still five times below the highest dose at which no adverse effect has been found,"" he says. Vitamin E intake is generally a concern only at very high doses, above 1500 IU per day. Several studies have suggested that these levels promote hemorrhaging and interfere with normal blood clotting. For this reason, high doses of vitamin E are not recommended for people taking blood-thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin) and aspirin. Health.com: Eight breathing tips for people with COPD . For people concerned about their lung health, taking vitamin E and C is not a bad idea, says Blumberg. ""If I were talking to somebody who was a former smoker and who was concerned about minimizing their risk of not only lung disease but also heart disease and cancer, then taking a supplement of C and E would be a reasonable thing to do,"" he says. In fact, anyone who thought he or she was at increased risk of COPD could potentially benefit from these supplements, he adds. Supplements of beta-carotene, which is a precursor of the antioxidant vitamin A, should be used with caution, however. While a 2006 French study found that people with diets high in beta-carotene had a slower decline in lung function over an eight-year period, heavy smokers and drinkers may not benefit. Two studies found that beta-carotene supplements increased the risk of lung cancer in people who smoked more than one pack a day and drank heavily. According to Sims, the new study offers an incentive to look closer at the potential to use vitamin E or other antioxidants to help prevent COPD. ""If it could be done with something like vitamin E, that's a relatively low-risk intervention, that would be the Holy Grail."" Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

105,"(CNN) -- A disgruntled employee shot to death the owners of a store in Boulder, Colorado, and then may have turned the gun on himself, police said Tuesday. Police found Sean Griffin, 40, and his wife Staci Griffin, 41, dead in a back room of the Boulder Stove & Flooring on Monday morning. Also dead was Robert Montgomery, 50. Montgomery had a 9 mm Smith & Wesson handgun in his hand and appeared to have suffered a single gunshot wound, said police spokeswoman Sarah Huntley. The Griffins sustained multiple wounds. Montgomery told friends and wrote in a journal that he was upset over a recent change in sales commission and bonus policy at work, Huntley said. He purchased the gun on May 7, she said. Police said Montgomery had been employed at Boulder Stove & Flooring since 2003. A salesman and a customer were inside the store when the gunshots rang out at 11:09 a.m. They jumped in the customer's vehicle, drove away and called 911, Huntley said. Police arrived minutes later to find the three dead. An autopsy will determine whether Montgomery was the shooter, but Huntley said police suspect him after finding the same kind of Cor-Bon 9 mm ammunition at his house that was used in the shooting. Police said they found 13 spent shell casings around the scene of the shootings with one round still in the chamber of the gun. No rounds were left in the magazine, they said. At his home, they found a box of Cor-Bon 9 mm ammunition with 14 rounds missing. Investigators said they found a second magazine in Montgomery's backpack loaded with 10 rounds of Eagle brand 9 mm ammunition. At his home, they found an empty box of Eagle 9 mm ammunition.","Police find three dead in Colorado store .

106,"(CNN) -- Tar balls found on Florida Keys beaches Monday and Tuesday are not from a massive oil spill off the coast of Louisiana, the Coast Guard said Wednesday. ""A sampling of tar balls discovered on beaches at Fort Zachary State Park, Fla., Smathers Beach in Key West, Big Pine Key, Fla., and Loggerhead Key in the Dry Tortugas National Park, Fla., were flown by a Coast Guard HU-25 Falcon jet based in Miami, Fla., to New London, Conn., Tuesday for testing and analysis,"" a Coast Guard statement said. ""The results of those tests conclusively show that the tar balls collected from Florida Keys beaches do not match the type of oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico,"" the statement said. ""The source of the tar balls remains unknown at this time."" However, ""the conclusion that these tar balls are not from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill incident in no way diminishes the need to continue to aggressively identify and clean up tar ball-contaminated areas in the Florida Keys,"" said Coast Guard Capt. Pat DeQuattro, commanding officer of Sector Key West. DeQuattro authorized the use of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund on Tuesday to begin cleanups of any oil pollution on Florida Keys shores and established a unified command made up of members of the Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of the Interior, and state and local officials to manage the tar ball response, the Coast Guard said. The tar balls nevertheless have raised fears that oil from the Gulf spill is headed to the coastlines of Florida and beyond. Researchers and federal officials seem to agree that a plume of oil is being dragged into the Gulf of Mexico's Loop Current. The current flows through the Yucatan Channel between Cuba and Mexico, and then northward, where it loops just south of the Florida Keys and travels to the west side of the western Bahamas, according to meteorologists. The European Space Agency issued a statement Wednesday saying satellite images show the oil is in the Loop Current. ""With these images from space, we have visible proof that at least oil from the surface of the water has reached the current,"" Bertrand Chapron of Ifremer, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea, said in the statement. A new tracking forecast prepared by four experts relying on five computer models shows that part of the oil may reach the Keys in five to six days, and Miami, Florida, five days after that, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, said in a statement Tuesday. ""While I always hope for the best, this is looking like really out-of-control bad,"" Nelson said. The forecast cited by Nelson assumes the Loop Current's persistence and does not take into account dispersion and evaporation from the oil spill, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. It remains to be seen how much oil has entered the current. In addition, he said, ""the Loop Current is much warmer than surrounding water, which would cause oil to evaporate at a greater rate than it is evaporating near the source of the spill."" Also Tuesday, NOAA shut down fishing in a larger part of the Gulf over which the federal government has jurisdiction: a total of 45,728 square miles, which is 19 percent of the Gulf, NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said. An undersea oil well has been gushing an estimated 5,000 barrels of oil a day (210,000 gallons) into the Gulf since late April, when the drill rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 40 miles off Louisiana. Some estimates have put the amount of oil spewing from the well far higher. Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the explosion and sinking, and the cause has not been determined. Samples taken by scientists offshore have raised concerns that large plumes of oil are settling below the surface. But federal officials said the results have not been fully analyzed. Some of the oil has washed ashore on the Louisiana coast. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday that the slick was 50 miles off the Mississippi coast. Weather Underground meteorologist Jeff Masters said Tuesday that based on satellite imagery, ""the oil is definitely in the Loop Current. ... The only question is how much oil made it in."" Others, including Lubchenco, said the oil was poised to enter the current Tuesday but had not yet done so. Once it does, scientists say it could reach Florida in as little as four and as many as 10 days. Once in the Florida Straits -- waters between Florida, Cuba and the Bahamas -- onshore winds would be required to push the oil onto shore, along with oil getting into an eddy on the edge of the current, Lubchenco said. The oil might not actually make it to Florida, depending on current patterns, Masters said. ""The currents right now in the Gulf of Mexico are changing rapidly, day by day. It's kind of an unstable situation."" Chanmin Hu, associate professor of optical oceanography at the University of Miami, said scientists ""do not have a very reliable, sophisticated 3-D model to capture what's going on on the ocean bottom."" Most efforts have been concentrated on the surface of the water, he said, and different depths have not been observed. Hu said he and other researchers are headed to the spot where the oil meets the Loop Current and will collect samples and measure water properties on Wednesday. According to the NOAA website, tar balls are remnants of oil spills. When crude oil floats on the surface of the water, it is torn into smaller patches covering a wider area by winds and waves. The oil undergoes a process called ""weathering."" The lighter components of the oil evaporate, and heavier components are left behind. Some crude oils mix with water to form ""an emulsion that often looks like chocolate pudding"" that is thicker and stickier than the initial oil, NOAA said. ""Winds and waves continue to stretch and tear the oil patches into smaller pieces, or tar balls."" The tar balls can travel hundreds of miles, according to the website.","Coast Guard tested tar balls from Keys, Dry Tortugas; source is unknown, it says .

107,"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Haiti's capital awoke to increasing desperation Thursday morning, a day and a half after a devastating earthquake, with covered bodies piling up along streets and modern aspects of life, such as electricity, mostly missing. The streets of Port-au-Prince resembled grainy black-and-white newsreels from World War II that showed the rubble of bombed-out houses in Berlin and London. The devastation was wide and often horrific. A one-hour drive from the airport to a walled-in hotel where the CNN contingent is staying revealed the widespread destruction from Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake. Flattened and severely damaged houses were found on every block, and the streets were choked with pedestrians and residents. They set up overnight camps and slept by the thousands in dark and crowded parks and on sidewalks, for fear of being inside if another powerful quake hit. Numerous aftershocks have rattled the capital. Sporadic gunfire was heard Wednesday night outside the hotel where CNN is lodged. Sirens could be heard at times, but the predominant sounds in the pre-dawn darkness were the shouts and screams from the thousands of people who spent the night in a dark park across the street. A rooster's crowing could sometimes be heard above the din. After electricity in the hotel was shut off at 1 a.m., CNN technicians worked on satellite equipment by flashlight. The hotel resembles a compound, with razor wire topping eight-foot walls and a gated parking lot, guarded by a man wielding an old shotgun. And although the hotel's residents seemed safe, and street violence had not been seen, there was a feeling of apprehension. As dawn broke, residents wandered slowly through the streets, their destination unknown in a city with seemingly nowhere to go. Still, there were glimmers of hope that the situation was inching toward improvement. The airport, damaged by the quake, began to come back to life Wednesday. The Aeroport International Toussaint Louverture had been closed since the quake struck. But by Wednesday afternoon, the first small-plane commercial flights started to arrive. The airport picked up energy and vitality as planes carrying supplies and ferrying search-and-rescue squads began filling the tarmac. Francklin Pierre, manager for Haiti's Copa Airlines, was in his airport office on Tuesday, sending an e-mail to a friend in Trinidad and Tobago, when he felt the tremor just before 5 p.m. He stood up and stumbled out of his office but could not go far because the building was shaking so hard. ""It was an eternity for me,"" he said. ""That building was shaking like a paper."" His mother and daughter survived, Pierre said, but his father is missing. ""We are all still looking for my father,"" he said. ""We can't reach him. We don't know where he is."" Lionel Isaac, director of the airport authority, said engineers will examine the structural damage Thursday to see if the terminal can be opened again. The runway and the electricity are sound, he said. If the terminal cannot be opened any time soon, Isaac said, an American Airlines cargo building may be used as temporary terminal. He hopes to have 30-seat commercial airplanes flying into the airport within the next few days. Large military cargo aircraft were landing routinely and often Wednesday afternoon. Several U.S. Coast Guard and Air Force planes stood on the tarmac, their engines running the whole time. One took on a load of passengers and left. International help also started to arrive. Thirty-five members of the Icelandic Search and Rescue Team arrived aboard a large jet. ""They will stay here for as long as it takes,"" said Thorbjorn Johnsson, a counselor from the Icelandic Foreign Ministry who accompanied the team. ""We offered to help and Haiti accepted."" A Canadian military squad also arrived to drop off supplies and a reconnaissance squad, in preparation for a disaster response team scheduled to arrive Thursday aboard a C-17 cargo plane with two helicopters on board. The Canadian crew planned to leave Wednesday night to make room for other planes on the crowded tarmac. ""Once I've dropped that off, I'm just taking up room,"" said Capt. Wayne Freeland, the plane's pilot. ""I've got to make room for everyone else. I'm just a bus driver, my friend."" American Airlines, which has been flying into Port-Au-Prince for 40 years, has brought in 30,000 pounds of water and food and plans to bring in more Thursday, said Art Torno, the airline's managing director for the Caribbean. As the sun climbed into the sky Thursday, the din from the park across the street from the hotel quieted, replaced by an occasional car horn and the chattering of residents speaking their rapid-fire French patois. A small crowd of young men gathered at a concrete wall that had toppled at a home next to the hotel. Stooped over, they busted the concrete blocks into smaller chunks, their purpose in doing so not readily apparent.","Bodies pile up in streets; residents wander, apparently aimlessly, in rubble .

108,"(CNN) -- A 4.5-magnitude earthquake struck Southern California on Tuesday evening, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The quake was downgraded from an earlier magnitude of 5.1. The temblor was centered 18 miles west-southwest of El Centro, California, just north of Mexicali in Mexico's Baja California, the USGS said. It struck at a depth of 6.3 miles. ""This earthquake is within the aftershock zone of a magnitude 7.2 (earthquake) that occurred on April 4"" near Mexicali, said Susan Potter of the USGS, adding ""this is an area that was exposed to many large earthquakes in the past."" At least two people were killed and 100 injured in the April 4 quake. CNN's Patty Lane contributed to this report.","Temblor was centered 18 miles west-southwest of El Centro, California .

109,"Washington (CNN) -- Wider restrictions on fishing in the Gulf of Mexico are raising fresh concerns in an industry already hard-hit by the massive BP oil spill. With thousands of barrels of oil still spewing out of a damaged undersea well every day, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Tuesday that it was nearly doubling the portion of the Gulf's federal waters that are now closed to fishing. The restricted zone now pushes south and east into the heart of the Gulf -- another blow to a $2.4 billion industry already reeling from the nearly month-old spill. For Greg Abrams, a commercial fisherman in Panama City, Florida, that means his boats are being pushed further west to chase big catch like bluefin tuna, swordfish and mahi-mahi. ""They'll have to go in somewhere else, probably around Galveston (Texas), instead of coming home,"" Abrams said. ""That'll cause some problems, but it's better to be safe than sorry."" Louisiana fisherman get paid for helping cleanup . Abrams owns a fleet of 14 fishing boats and hires another 41. One of them has  caught 80 tuna in a seven-day stretch off the Gulf's Loop Current, a haul he called a ""great start"" to a seven-month season. ""Now he has to leave the current and go farther west,"" Abrams said. NOAA's latest order extends the closed zone to a nearly 46,000-square-mile stretch, about 19 percent of the Gulf. The ongoing spill now threatens to be picked up by the Loop Current, which could spread some oil around the tip of Florida and up the U.S. East Coast. Unconfirmed reports from researchers that large amounts of oil is spreading below the surface, as well as concerns about the effect of chemical dispersants used to break up the spill, also worry people in the industry. Deborah Long, a spokeswoman for the Southern Shrimpers Association, said fishermen could face a ""multi-generational effect"" on the creatures from which they draw their living, with shrimp and bluefin tuna the two species with the most to lose. ""We're not just worried about the shrimp stocks here,"" Long said. ""We're worried about the entire marine food chain."" Many areas off the Louisiana and Alabama coasts remain open to both commercial and recreational fishing as BP, the Coast Guard and volunteers try to battle the spreading slick offshore. But news accounts of the spill have prompted tourists to cancel fishing trips even in waters that are so far unaffected, said Sonny Schindler, of Shore Thing Charters in Diamondhead, Mississippi. ""The oil hasn't done a thing to us -- it's the exposure,"" Schindler said Tuesday. He added, ""Our water's still open, we're still trying to fish every chance we can, and we're open for business."" And some of those who are still able to get out on the water are now seeing buyers go elsewhere, said Bobby Lovell, a crab fisherman in Louisiana's St. Bernard Parish. State-controlled waters near New Orleans were opened for three days starting Saturday, Lovell said. He and his father laid crab traps last weekend in Lake Borgne and came back with an ice chest full of crustaceans -- but he said many of his buyers have turned to suppliers in western Louisiana, which isn't currently threatened by the spill. Tar balls found in Florida Keys not believed to be from Gulf spill . ""I'm stressed. I'm pacing back and forth, and I'm normally a calm guy,"" he said. However, ""The big wholesalers are in the same predicament I am right now,"" he said. The closures follow an April 20 explosion that sank the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon, taking 11 workers with it. Efforts to shut down the well that was ripped open by the accident have failed so far, though well owner BP says it has been able to capture some of the escaping oil and pump it to a ship on the surface. ""The fish will move. They have fins. They will travel,"" Abrams said. ""I'm just kind of upset that they didn't have a plan B to the plan A for the cleanup, and the government wasn't doing their job to keep an eye on BP.""","New restrictions cover 19 percent of Gulf .

110,"Washington (CNN) -- A BP official says a gusher of oil pouring from its damaged Gulf of Mexico well could be shut off as early as next week. BP Managing Director Bo Dudley said Thursday night the company will pump fluids into the well this weekend in the beginning of a process that -- if successful -- could lead to the leak finally being closed off in a matter of days. ""If that option doesn't work, we've got a second and a third option we'll do after that,"" Dudley said on CNN's Larry King on Thursday. ""We're hopeful that next week we'll be able to shut it off."" Earlier in the day, BP acknowledged that the underwater gusher is bigger than estimated to date, as new video showed a cloud of crude billowing around its undersea siphon. Company spokesman Mark Proegler said Thursday that the siphon is now drawing about 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons) per day up to a ship on the surface of the Gulf -- as much as government and company officials had estimated the spill was pouring into the Gulf every day for a month. Proegler declined to estimate how much more oil was escaping. BP America Chairman Lamar McKay said Wednesday that the figure used by the oil spill response team had a degree of ""uncertainty"" built into it. But figures by independent researchers have run up to many times higher: Steve Wereley, a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University, told CNN's ""American Morning"" that the spill could be as big as 20,000 to 100,000 barrels a day. And members of Congress released video from the company that showed much more oil pouring out of the damaged well than the siphon was capturing. Rep. Ed Markey, who leads a House subcommittee investigating the disaster, told reporters, ""I think now we are beginning to understand that we cannot trust BP."" ""People do not trust the experts any longer,"" said Markey, D-Massachusetts. ""BP has lost all credibility. Now the decisions will have to be made by others, because it is clear that they have been hiding the actual consequences of this spill."" Meanwhile, the Coast Guard announced the creation of a federal Flow Rate Technical Group to assess the actual flow rate from the well. Coast Guard Capt. Ron LaBrec said that Adm. Thad Allen would oversee the team, which will include members from the Coast Guard, the Minerals Management Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Society and others from the science community and academia. The peer-reviewed team, which has already begun its work, is to determine the flow rate from the beginning of the incident to the present, LaBrec said. The Obama administration announced Thursday that it has ordered BP to release all data related to the massive spill, including environmental sampling analyses, internal investigation reports and details of the cleanup effort. In a letter to BP Group CEO Tony Hayward, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson told BP to post that information on a website and update it daily. ""The public and the United States government are entitled to nothing less than complete transparency in this matter,"" they concluded. The spill began with an April 20 explosion and fire that sank the drill rig Deepwater Horizon two days later. Eleven workers were lost with the rig, which was owned by drilling contractor Transocean and hired by BP. The resulting slick now threatens the coastal marshes of southeastern Louisiana, where brown, syrupy oil made it past protective booms and into the wetlands near the mouth of the Mississippi River on Wednesday. Over the weekend, BP inserted a piece of pipe into the larger of the two leak points and began drawing oil from the undersea gusher, located about a mile underwater, up to a ship on the surface. It also has been laying booms out along barrier islands and spraying hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemical dispersants on the surface and near the sources of the leak. But that element of the response came under new fire as well on Thursday, as the EPA ordered BP to find a less toxic chemical to use to break up the oil. The EPA gave the company a day to pick a new substance and three days to start using it instead of the current dispersant, known as Corexit 9500. The chemical has been rated more toxic and less effective than many others on the list of 18 EPA-approved dispersants, according to testimony at a congressional hearing Wednesday. ""Because of its use in unprecedented volumes and because much is unknown about the underwater use of dispersants, EPA wants to ensure BP is using the least toxic product authorized for use,"" the agency said in a statement announcing the order. ""We reserve the right to discontinue the use of this dispersant method if any negative impacts on the environment outweigh the benefits."" Corexit 9500 includes petroleum distillates, propylene glycol and a proprietary organic sulfonic salt, and prolonged contact with it can cause eye or skin irritation, according to the manufacturer's material data safety sheet. The document warns that ""repeated or prolonged exposure may irritate the respiratory tract."" But BP says Corexit is biodegradable, has been approved by the EPA and the Coast Guard and is ""readily available in the quantities required"" by a response plan approved by the government before the spill. iReport: Track the spill; Share stories . ""It has been very effective in causing the oil to form into small, isolated droplets that remain suspended until they're either eaten by naturally occurring microbes, evaporate, are picked up or dissolve,"" the company said. But it added, ""At the same time, we are conducting ongoing assessment of alternative or supplemental dispersant products."" Meanwhile, BP is readying a new attempt to plug the leak for Sunday by injecting a large amount of heavy ""mud"" -- a fluid used as a lubricant and counterweight in drilling operations -- into the well bore. If that succeeds, the well will be cemented shut, officials have said. ""Everything is being done to make sure that happens,"" Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, whose department oversees offshore oil drilling, told CNN's ""American Morning"" Thursday. ""We have the best scientists in the world who are overseeing what is going on. So, we are hopeful that it will happen soon."" Salazar said BP, which leased the rig from Transocean, has tried many techniques to stop the leaking and the government will do all in its power to hold them accountable. ""They're putting a lot of hope on that Sunday,"" he said. ""We'll see if it happens."" Salazar announced Wednesday that he was dividing the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, which regulates oil exploration, into three divisions. The agency has come under fire since long before the spill, and Salzar said it would be reorganized to separate what he called the conflicting duties of regulating oil companies and collecting royalties from them. ""We inherited here what was a legacy of an agency that essentially was rubber-stamping whatever it was that the oil and gas industry wanted,"" Salazar said. ""We have been on a reform agenda from Day One."" CNN's Ed Lavandera, Marylynn Ryan and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","NEW: Well could be shut off next week, BP official says .

111,"(CNN) -- ""Banchao! Banchao!"" Save me! Save me! A rescue worker could hear the screams of a passenger on Air India Flight IX-812, but the plane was consumed with flames. Fire was leaping in every part of the Boeing jet that crashed early Saturday in southern India. The rescue worker heard things bursting in the extreme heat, he told CNN's sister network, CNN-IBN. Then it was quiet, and he understood that no one else was alive. The Air India plane had flown in from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, carrying 160 passengers and six crew members. Among them were 19 children and four infants. Some people were returning home. An anxious young bride-to-be and a man on his way to perform last rites for his father were also on the flight. Others were migrant workers. Millions of Indians work as laborers in Persian Gulf states. Most perished, charred beyond recognition in the fiery wreckage. Only the aircraft's tail was left intact, officials said. Rescuers scrambled to find survivors all day Saturday. Mostly they pulled bodies. The eight who survived recounted their harrowing tales for CNN-IBN. Ummerfarook Mohammed said the cabin quickly filled with smoke after the jet skidded off the runway and hit a boundary wall. The impact created a hole in the plane's body, he said. He crawled out and ran for his life. Nearby villagers carted him to the hospital in a rickshaw. And then there were those who counted their blessings on Saturday for not having boarded their ill-fated flight in Dubai. Vasant Shetty's friend had booked him on the Mangalore-bound plane, but he was too busy at work and decided not to take the flight. ""It's all God's grace. I missed the flight and survived,"" Shetty told the Press Trust of India news agency. ""I don't know what to say about the ill-fated passengers who were killed,"" he said. ""I pray for them.""","Rescue worker heard a passenger's screams .

112,"(CNN)  -- Facing near-record floodwaters, Red River communities in Minnesota and North Dakota raced Tuesday to shore up levees and dikes, officials said. ""We're in the full flood fight mode here,"" Fargo, North Dakota, City Administrator Pat Zavoral said. Last week, warm weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, causing the Red River to swell as it flows north. Upstream, snow and ice have yet to melt, pushing water back toward the two cities. Forecasters predict the river will crest Saturday about 20 feet above flood stage. Last year, the river rose to a record 40.8 feet at Fargo. ""We have every contractor we have in the area on a 24-hour shift, preparing dikes, hauling dirt, delivering sandbags,"" Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker said. ""We have never lost a flood fight here in Fargo,"" he said. ""We're going to be optimistic about this for the rest of the week, that we're going to be able to save our community one more time."" Volunteers have answered the call to fill 1 million sandbags this week, Zavoral said. ""We're putting up temporary clay levees, and we've produced sandbags, and we're delivering them to the low-lying neighborhoods,"" he said. Early Tuesday, the river level stood at 27.6 feet, according to the National Weather Service. Flood stage is 18 feet, according to the service. ""We thought we had a couple more weeks, and with the weather and the quick thaw and the rains we've had recently, it's really made it more difficult and it's really sped up the crest,"" Fargo police Sgt. Carlos Nestler said. Residents in Fargo and Moorhead are busy building sandbag dikes along the river's edge. Fargo's Kurt Kaye is doing what he did last year, helping friends protect their home from the rising Red River, which runs through their backyard. Like most residents, he said he's resolved to keep the water at bay. ""I think everyone is a little tired of it, but they'll get behind it and go,"" he said. ""They need to get it done to save their houses."" Zavoral, the city administrator, said Fargo is better prepared this year to deal with a major flood. ""We've spent about $10 million putting in permanent flood protection in some of the neighborhoods and bought out about 26 homes in the low-lying areas,"" he said. City officials have said they believe they'll need about 1 million fewer sandbags than were used last year. Is severe weather happening near you? Share your stories, photos and video .

113,"(CNN) -- BP is doing all it can to respond to the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, a top BP official said Monday, even as criticism of the company's handling of the crisis was growing. ""We are going to clear every drop of oil off the shore,"" Tony Hayward told reporters at Fourchon Beach, Louisiana, where cleanup efforts were under way. ""We will remediate any environmental damage and we will put the Gulf Coast right and back to normality as fast as we can."" The company's next effort to plug the leak is to come at dawn Wednesday. BP plans to pump thick, viscous fluid twice the density of water into the site of the leak to stop the flow so the well can then be sealed with cement -- the ""top kill"" procedure. Hayward, noting that the attempt will be carried out on the seafloor a mile below the sea surface, estimated the odds of success for the method at 60 percent to 70 percent. Asked about the company's continued use of an oil dispersant in the face of an EPA request that it use a less toxic alternative, Hayward said, ""Everything that we do with dispersants is with the explicit approval of the EPA."" But EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said she was not pleased with BP's response to the government's request. ""The answer we got back from BP, to me, seemed more like a defense of their current choice -- reminded me a little bit of that old commercial 'I'd rather fight than switch,'"" she told reporters in Venice, Louisiana. ""We need to ask ourselves whether there's not a better product out there."" Federal officials told BP that ""we expect to see a substantial reduction in the overall amount of dispersant used,"" from 50,000 gallons or more per day to less than 15,000 gallons per day, she said. That can be accomplished by releasing the dispersant below the surface of the water, she said. She said tests showed that the dispersant, Corexit 9500, was more toxic to baby shrimp and baby silverfish than were any of five other dispersants. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen, the Obama administration's point person in the Gulf, called the decision to use dispersants a tradeoff. ""It means we're willing to accept the effect of the oil in the ocean rather than on land,"" he said. Hayward acknowledged that BP's reputation has taken a beating, but said the company is being straightforward about its efforts. ""We're trying to communicate openly and transparently about everything that we've done,"" he said. As the environmental impact of the disaster was just beginning to unfold, he noted that BP will set aside a half billion dollars to open a research program to study the effects of the spill. Hayward's comments came a day after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar expressed frustration with the delay in stopping the spill, asserting that BP has ""from day one, frankly, not fulfilled the mission it was supposed to fulfill."" He said the company has missed ""deadline after deadline"" and that he was not confident that BP knew what it was doing. ""If we find that they're [BP] not doing what they're supposed to be doing, we'll push them out of the way,"" Salazar said. BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles acknowledged Monday that the federal government could take over the effort, but said the results would be no better. ""I don't think anyone else could do better than we are,"" he said. If the ""top kill"" procedure does not work, he said, BP will try to fit a second, smaller containment dome over the ruptured pipe, Suttles said. A first containment dome failed to stop the leak. If the second dome does not work, he said, the company would ""still have plenty of other options."" The company could try a ""junk shot,"" which would involve plugging the well with rubber and other substances, BP Managing Director Robert Dudley said Sunday. However, a permanent solution could take until August -- the estimated completion date for a relief well, said Allen. By the time the runaway well is capped, the amount of oil discharged could be comparable to the total released in the Exxon Valdez environmental disaster 20 years ago, Allen said. But he expressed no appetite for suggestions that the federal government should take over the project. ""You need to do very technical work at 5,000 feet,"" he said, referring to the depth of the leak. ""You need equipment and expertise that's not generally within the government -- federal government -- in terms of competency, capability or capacity."" The administration vowed to persevere. ""We are going to be tireless in working to do everything we can to support the community and everybody whose livelihoods have been imperiled down in the region,"" President Obama said at a reception celebrating Asian-American and Pacific-Islander Heritage Month. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke on Monday declared a fishery disaster in the Gulf of Mexico because of the economic impact of the oil spill on fisheries in the region. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has closed nearly 20 percent of the commercial and recreational fisheries in the area because of the spill, and Locke's declaration will allow the federal government to put additional resources into the Gulf states to soften the blow. Meanwhile, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Salazar -- each on a fourth visit to the region since the April 20 spill began -- toured the spill area Monday accompanied by a phalanx of politicians. ""We are going to do everything we can to protect these lands, to protect these parishes, to make sure that claims are paid,"" Napolitano told reporters in Galliano, Louisiana. Read about Louisiana's closed oyster harvesting areas . With an armada of more than 1,000 vessels and the efforts of more than 22,000 people who have put into place hundreds of thousands of feet of boom, the response to the oil spill is the largest in U.S. history, said Napolitano. That did not satisfy Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who called Monday for more resources to be mobilized against the oil and reiterated his call for the Army Corps of Engineers to move quickly to approve a plan to protect threatened marshland by building sand booms. ""We've got to take matters into our own hands if we are going to win this battle to protect our coast,"" he said. ""Every day we are not dredging sand gives one more day for oil to enter the ecosystem."" He bemoaned the fact that nearly 70 miles of Louisiana coast has been hit by oil. Read about a lawsuit filed by oil rig victims, families . ""BP is the responsible party and we need the federal government to make sure they are held accountable,"" he said. ""Our way of life depends on it."" Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry, the federal on-scene coordinator for the response effort, told reporters the barrier island project was under review. Environmental and wildlife officials ""are weighing in on the impact to endangered and threatened species, and other impacts this large-scale project could have,"" she said. Since the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon in late April about 40 miles off Louisiana, oil has been gushing into the Gulf at an estimated rate of at least 5,000 barrels a day (210,000 gallons). Some estimates are far higher. Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the sinking. The cause of the explosion has not been determined.","NEW: U.S. declares fisheries disaster in oily Gulf .

114,"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A 15-year-old boy who was set on fire, allegedly by a group of youths he knew, told police he remembered ""cold stuff all over my clothes and ... burning."" ""Somebody poured something on me and lit me on fire,"" Michael Brewer tells police from his hospital bed in the audiotaped interview conducted November 23, six weeks after the October 12 incident. ""I started running."" Broward County, Florida, prosecutors released the interview, along with other audio, video and documents, to media outlets including CNN on Monday and Tuesday. Three teenagers have been charged as adults with attempted murder in connection with Brewer's burning. Detectives said eyewitnesses have told them that 16-year-old Jesus Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Denver Jarvis, 15, allegedly poured alcohol over him, and that Matthew Bent, also 15, allegedly encouraged the attack. Detectives said Mendez admitted that he set Brewer on fire, and that he made a ""bad decision,"" according to an arrest transcript. Interviews with the suspects were not part of the evidence released this week. Detectives believe that Brewer owed Bent $40 for a video game. When Brewer did not pay, police said, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle, then was arrested when Brewer reported him to the police. The next day, police believe, the group sought out Brewer. In the interview, Brewer speaks in a soft, labored voice and sounds breathless. He can be heard inhaling and exhaling on the recording. He told police that Bent ""came to my house and he tried to take my dad's bike. He threatened me. He threatened my sister."" He said Bent wanted him to buy something that he didn't want to buy, but he couldn't remember what. ""I think it was stolen,"" Brewer said. He said he saw Jarvis pour the flammable liquid on him, and told police he was walking away from the others when it occurred. When the teens approached him, he said, one told him, ""Nobody's going to hit you."" Instead, he recalled ""cold stuff all over my clothes and ... burning."" Bent, Mendez and Jarvis face a maximum sentence of up to 30 years in prison if convicted. Two other boys who were allegedly involved, a 13-year-old and 15-year-old, have not been charged in the attack. After he was set on fire, ""I'm like, run. Run,"" Brewer said. ""I ... jumped the fence and jumped into the pool."" ""This guy comes running out and tries to pull me out of the water, and I said, 'Leave me, leave me,' 'cause my skin was, like, hanging,"" he said. ""I got out of the pool, and ... in a chair. And then they put me on a stretcher, and they strapped me, and then they put me on the helicopter."" A videotaped interview with an eyewitness to the incident is also among the pieces of evidence released. In it, the teenager recalls hearing Bent, who is known as Zeke, tell Jarvis to pour the flammable liquid on Brewer. ""Zeke's like, 'Yeah, yeah, pour it on him,'"" the witness says, estimating the pouring lasted three to five seconds. Asked if a lot of fluid was poured on Brewer, the boy said it soaked his entire back. Brewer was released from Jackson Memorial Hospital's burn unit on December 22 after more than two months. During that stay, he had three skin-graft surgeries and was on a ventilator for a month. He was readmitted to the hospital earlier this month after experiencing trouble breathing, but was re-released after three days. Doctors have said he faces a long recovery and rehabilitation process. Brewer is recovering at an undisclosed location. His mother, Valerie Brewer, has said he will be home-schooled once he has recovered enough to resume his school work.

The storm brought blizzard conditions to some areas as gusty winds and blowing snow created whiteout conditions across much of the upper Midwest and Great Lakes regions. Winds of at least 35 mph and rain to the east caused hundreds of flights to be delayed or canceled, leaving travelers stranded. Parts of the Southeast received more than 6 inches of rain, causing flash flooding. A 28-year-old woman was killed in Omaha, Nebraska, Tuesday night when a truck plowing snow in a parking lot backed into her, police spokesman Jacob Bettin said. She was pronounced dead at the scene. In Nashville, Tennessee, early morning winds -- possibly up to 50 mph -- toppled the Christmas tree at the Tennessee State Capital, said CNN affiliate WKRN-TV. A facilities supervisor said the tree had been secured with hooks in concrete. An Arctic high pressure system or air mass began moving southward from Canada on Wednesday, bringing with it frigid temperatures. The temperature in Portland, Oregon, was 12 degrees, breaking the previous record of 15 degrees, set in 1972, said Jonathan Wolfe, meteorologist with the weather service's Portland bureau. By Wednesday afternoon the temperature in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was 9 degrees. It was minus 2 degrees in Denver, Colorado; and 11 in Kansas City, Missouri. Forecasters warned that places such as North Dakota and Minnesota could get dangerous wind chill readings of 25 to 35 degrees below zero. Madison, Wisconsin, received more than 17 inches of snow, prompting the University of Wisconsin to cancel classes for the first time since 1990. The campus police department estimated 3,000 students descended onto the school's Bascom Hill Wednesday afternoon for a snowball fight, with a few minor injuries reported, according to the university's Web site. Watch snow blow outside a hotel in Wisconsin . Early Wednesday morning, students began forming a giant snowball about six blocks from the campus and rolled it to an intersection near the university, former student Chad Krueger told CNN's iReport. How is the weather where you are? Send an iReport . The storm prodded Nicole Stec of Janesville, Wisconsin, to finally buy those new tires her car had been needing. ""I'm a procrastinator, so I put it off for a while. But now it's time because there's snow on the ground,"" Stec told WISC-TV at a Janesville tire shop. ""It's my Christmas present from Santa, apparently."" Elsewhere, Des Moines, Iowa, received more than a foot of snow, with more to come, and Freeport, Illinois, had 11 inches. Schools were also closed across Iowa and parts of Minnesota. Passengers heading to cities in snow-bound states were left waiting. High winds in the Northeast were creating flight delays of more than an hour Wednesday night. New England also was expected to get dangerously low temperatures as snowfall was tapering off by Wednesday evening. Areas in Maine were expected to get an additional 4-8 inches of snow overnight after as much as 10 inches fell earlier in the day, the weather service said. Connecticut's Department of Transportation deployed all of its 632 trucks to clear roads of snow that prompted numerous school closings Wednesday morning, CNN affiliate WFSB-TV reported. Watch iReporters' shots of the storm . Flash floods struck north-central Alabama where rescuers ended up in a tree early Wednesday when their boat overturned as they tried to help a motorist whose car was swept into a rain-swollen creek, said the administrative assistant for Morgan County's Emergency Management Agency. ""The people were all right,"" said Rita Weeks. ""They waited in the tree until people could come get them."" Earlier Wednesday, in the same county, a man hung on to a bridge over a creek after his vehicle was swept away by floodwaters, Weeks said. Forecasters said the area got more than 3 inches of rain before it stopped Wednesday morning, but flood advisories were still in effect Wednesday night for much of the South. The storm left its mark on the West on Monday and Tuesday. Alpine Meadows, California, near Lake Tahoe received 42 inches of snow before the storm moved out of the region Tuesday afternoon. Pagosa Springs, Colorado, received 33 inches, and Flagstaff, Arizona, got 30, with similar amounts throughout the Rockies.

116,"LA GLORIA, Mexico (CNN) -- Tucked away in this small mountain village in Mexico, off a dusty road flanked by pig farms, is where the earliest case of swine flu -- a virus spreading globally -- was confirmed. Five-year-old Edgar Hernandez, known as ""patient zero,"" survived the earliest documented case of swine flu. Meet the child known as ""patient zero"" by his doctors -- 5-year-old Edgar Hernandez, who survived the earliest documented case of swine flu in an outbreak that, officials say, has now spread across four continents. His family lives in the 3,000-population village of La Gloria in the state of Veracruz, where a flu outbreak was reported on April 2. State officials arrived and tested dozens of people. Lab tests confirmed that Edgar was the only patient in Veracruz to test positive for the swine flu virus; the others had contracted a common flu. Health officials had returned to Edgar's sample only after cases of the new flu strain were spotted around the country.  Watch Dr. Gupta meet little Edgar » . ""In this case, there's a patient who turned out to be positive for the swine-flu virus, with the exception that at that time in no region of the world it had been established as an etiological, epidemic cause,"" said Mexico Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova. Edgar has managed to bounce back from his symptoms and playfully credits ice cream for helping him feel better. His mother blamed a huge pig farm in the neighborhood for the virus. Officials have conducted tests at the farm owned by U.S. company Smithfield Foods, and those tests came back negative. Swine influenza, or flu, is a contagious respiratory disease that affects pigs. When the flu spreads person to person, instead of from animals to humans, it can continue to mutate, making it harder to treat or fight, because people have no natural immunity. Symptoms include fever, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  Learn more about swine flu and how to treat it » . Common seasonal flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people every year worldwide, far more than the current outbreak of swine flu. But there is no vaccine for this new disease, and little natural immunity, an expert said. ""I think the reason to be concerned is ... we had a vaccine for regular flu,"" said Dr. Carlos del Rio of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. ""This is a totally new virus. ... You have a virus to which there's no pre-vaccination, there's no prior immunity. And, therefore, the mortality rate may be higher than other influenza viruses.""  Watch why swine flu is a ""sloppy virus"" » . Researchers do not know how the virus is jumping relatively easily from person to person, or why it's affecting what should be society's healthiest demographic. Meanwhile, in hard-hit Mexico City, the government closed universities, postponed sporting events, asked restaurants to serve only take-out food, and canceled church services in an effort to try to stem the spread of the virus. Worried residents continue to flood in night and day at hospitals, only to be turned away by armed guards.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta inside a Mexico City hospital » . Two of the most common antiviral drugs, Tamiflu and Relenza -- which are effective against swine flu -- are in short supply in Mexico's capital. It also has become impossible to find protective surgical masks, which the government had handed out to one out of every five residents. ""I was looking for a mask at my local pharmacy, but they sold out,"" supermarket worker Rafael Martinez said as he rode the subway. ""I know it's a risk, but I can't find one.""

117,"(CNN) -- Several thousand barrels of North Slope crude oil spilled into a containment area along the Alaska pipeline Tuesday when an open valve at a pump station allowed oil to overflow a tank, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company said. Alyeska said the incident took place about 10:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET) during a planned pipeline shutdown while the company was conducting fire command and valve leak testing at the pump station. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said a battery failed to control the valve when power was switched from the main grid during Alyeska's tests. The valve has been closed, shutting off the flow, the department said, but the pipeline remains shut down. The department said the next steps would be to clean up the oil in the containment area, determine the cause of the problem and restart oil flowing in the pipeline. No oil has been reported outside the containment area. Mark MacIntyre, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency in Seattle, Washington, said two EPA coordinators would arrive on the scene from Anchorage on Wednesday and have a report in the afternoon. The pump station is near Delta Junction, about 100 miles south of Fairbanks. Ayleska said the lined containment area that took the spill has a capacity of about 104,500 barrels. Ayleska also said there were no injuries and the pump station was evacuated. An incident management team and other responders were dispatched.

118,"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama used the growing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to renew his pitch for alternative energy Wednesday, arguing that the unfolding environmental disaster ""gives you a sense of where we're going"" without comprehensive reform. The federal government is ""going to bring every resource necessary to put a stop"" to the spill, the president said during a visit to a solar panel manufacturing facility in Fremont, California.  ""We will not rest until this well is shut, the environment is repaired, and the cleanup is complete."" But, he added, ""a lot of damage has been done already. The spill in the Gulf, which is just heartbreaking, only underscores the necessity"" of seeking alternative fuel sources. A failure to enact comprehensive energy reform, he argued, would pose a threat to national security and the economy, as well as the environment. Obama's remarks came two weeks after Sens. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, introduced a sweeping energy and climate change bill intended to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions while reshaping the energy sector. The House passed its own energy bill last year, and Obama has said he backs the efforts by Kerry and Lieberman to move the issue forward in the Senate. The president asked for Senate GOP cooperation on the issue during a closed-door meeting Tuesday with Republicans on Capitol Hill. However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, has indicated he wants immigration reform to take priority, and the politics of midterm congressional elections in November raises questions about the the possibility of gaining final approval this year of such major legislation as energy reform. Reid's position caused a potential Republican co-sponsor, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, to drop out of the talks with Lieberman and Kerry on drafting the proposal. The proposal addresses a range of energy issues, including expanded nuclear power production, incentives for the coal industry to seek cleaner methods, money to develop alternative energy sources and programs to help U.S. industry in the transition to a low-carbon system. On climate change, the measure seeks escalating reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in coming decades that match the levels set as goals by the Obama administration and contained in the House bill. Among other things, the proposal calls for emissions reductions from 2005 levels of 17 percent by 2020, 42 percent by 2030 and 83 percent by 2050. The Senate proposal includes expanded offshore oil drilling as part of a strategy to increase domestic production. However, provisions strengthening the ability of states to prevent more drilling off their coasts were added in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

119,"(CNN) -- Sandra Herold, the owner of a chimpanzee that was involved in a vicious attack on her friend last year, has died, her attorney said Tuesday. She was 72. Herold suffered a ruptured aortic aneurysm Monday night, Roger Golger said. Herold ""had suffered a series of heartbreaking losses over the last several years, beginning with the death of her only child, then her husband, then her beloved chimp Travis, as well as the tragic maiming of friend and employee Charla Nash,"" Golger said. Nash lost her nose, upper and lower lips, eyelids and both her hands in the attack in February 2009, as well as the ""bony structures in her mid-face,"" according to doctors. More than a year later, numerous surgeries and therapy sessions have helped Nash regain some mobility. Her family filed a lawsuit against Herold shortly after the attack, seeking $50 million in damages. Criminal charges were not filed, however, because authorities ruled Herold was not aware of the risk her pet posed. ""This past year was particularly difficult for Sandy,"" Golger said. ""She hated living alone in a house where she faced constant reminders of the vibrant and happy life she once led with her family and friends. The stress of defending a multimillion-dollar lawsuit and all that it entailed also weighed heavy on Sandy. In the end, her heart, which had been broken so many times before, could take no more."" The attack occurred February 16, 2009, when Herold called Nash for help in getting Travis back inside her house after he used a key to escape. When Nash arrived at the Stamford, Connecticut, home, the chimp, who had been featured in TV commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, jumped on her and began biting and mauling her. Police shot Travis to halt the attack and he later died of gunshot wounds. The mauling has raised questions about whether exotic animals should be kept as pets. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has said that primates and crocodiles should be added to a state list of animals that citizens are not allowed to own. Nash was discharged from the famed Cleveland Clinic, where doctors performed the nation's first face transplant, earlier this month. She is continuing her recovery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, where doctors have said she is a candidate for a face transplant.

120,"(CNN)  -- It's interesting how many people have swallowed the BP public relations' bait to call the explosion from Deepwater Horizon oil rig the Gulf oil spill. We need to call it what it is: the BP oil spill. The federal government needs to take control and take punitive action against BP and any negligent government regulators immediately. As a concerned citizen, preparedness speaker and author, and former commander of federal troops in disaster response, I watched with interest as BP brought out its big PR guns to protect its brand and its platoon of expert engineers, paid by BP to talk about how it happened and how they intended to fix it. BP's reaction was much like Toyota's when it was confronted with safety issues. It, too, focused on PR to protect its brand, versus telling the truth, and sent out its engineers to talk about the problem and the fix. The U.S. Coast Guard was the first responder. The Coast Guard's priority always is to save lives. They spent days looking for the 11 missing men. Meanwhile, BP took advantage of this time to make itself the authoritative voice in the news about the spill and blame other companies. The  U.S. government response was based on laws and rules that were created after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. After Valdez, the law changed to make the offending company responsible for the cleanup. A fund was created that all oil companies contributed to. If there was an emergency oil spill, a company could draw  up to $75 million from this fund to fix the problem.  But the fund was meant to help small wildcat operations, not huge conglomerates like BP. Sticking to that regulation was part of the problem. The No. 1 rule when dealing with disaster is to figure out which rules you need to break. Rules are designed for when everything is working. A democracy is based on trust. BP has proved it can't be trusted. iReporters share views on oil spill response . The government needs to change the game and make this a punitive effort. The government has been too friendly to oil companies. The government should immediately freeze BP's assets and start to charge the corporation -- say $100 million -- each day the oil flows. The money could be held in a fund that U.S. government draws on to take care of the people along the Gulf Coast and pay the states for doing the cleanup. Next, BP and the government bureaucrats who broke a law and put the public at risk need to go to jail. I remember when we were evacuating New Orleans on Saturday following Katrina. We pushed the survivors to the airport and a major called and said the pilots refused to fly the plane without a manifest and there was trouble with weapons scanners. I told him to direct everyone to put the people on the planes as fast as possible, and we would to do the manifest en route or on landing. As a result, we flew 16,000 people out of NOLA airport in less than seven hours. The priorities of the response to the spill must be to stop the flow of oil, prevent the oil from getting into the shoreline as much as possible, mitigate the effects of the oil in the ocean, and take care of the people who have lost their source of employment, such as  fishermen and those in the tourist industry. BP's job is to focus on stopping the flow of oil. The government needs to provide more military ""command and control"" of the situation. As BP works to stop the gusher, the government must address the problem of the oil coming ashore and take care of the people affected, possibly retraining them in other jobs. The government could do this by using the Stafford Act to fund the states so they can  protect their shoreline and clean up the oil. Then, the long-term effects of the spill must be mitigated. The people of the Gulf Coast, particularly South Louisiana, are still recovering from Katrina. They've been through hurricanes Rita, Gustav and Ike. They know hurricane season is right around the corner and this BP oil spill has the potential to get much worse. And they don't trust BP. In fact, the latest curse going around in southern Louisiana today is, ""BP you."" Punitive action must start immediately, with BP supplying the money, from fines, to help the Gulf Coast get over this catastrophe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Russel Honoré.","Gen. Russel Honoré: This disaster is the BP oil spill, not the Gulf oil spill .
BP should be fined, he says, even $100 million, each day the oil is gushing .
Money from fines should be used to help Gulf Coast and its people recover, Honoré says .

121,"(CNN) -- A Toyota Prius was not the cause of a March 9 crash in Harrison, New York, said authorities citing ""black and white"" results in their investigation. Harrison, New York, Police Capt. Anthony Marraccini revealed at a news conference Monday that evidence extracted from the wrecked 2005 Prius' data recorder showed no indication of brake compression as the car headed toward a stone wall. Rather, the accelerator was pressed 100 percent, authorities said. Marraccini said the data, which he described as ""black and white,"" was collected in a cooperative effort between Harrison police, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Toyota. ""Toyota has been very cooperative,"" said Marraccini. ""There's no possibility of any distortion of this data,"" he continued. ""These are the facts that surround this."" A housekeeper was driving the car at the time of the accident. She told police the vehicle accelerated on its own as she eased forward down her employer's driveway, causing her to crash into a stone wall on the other side of the road. The incident, which did not involve other vehicles nor injuries to anyone, drew attention because the 2005 Prius was part of Toyota's November recall to address the risk of pedal entrapment in the floor mat. But police said early on that floor mats were not a factor in this accident. A recall to address a sticky accelerator problem did not include the Prius. Monday's announcement corroborates a NHTSA statement from early in the investigation, explaining that ""information retrieved from the vehicle's onboard computer systems indicated there was no application of the brakes and the throttle was fully open."" The statement suggested at the time that the driver may have been stepping on the accelerator, instead of the brake as she told police. ""We do see these accidents on occasion,"" Marraccini said Monday. ""I think with all this hype about Toyota, people are just looking to point fingers,"" he said. Marraccini said that he spoke with the housekeeper about the findings of the investigation, but she remains ""very passionate about her statement."" ""When a driver believes they are on the brake pedal, they believe it. But there is no indication of that,"" Marraccini said. Toyota spokesman Wade Hoyt called the investigation ""thorough"" and ""conscientious,"" and praised authorities for their ""really outstanding piece of detective work."" CNN's Dana Garrett contributed to this report.","The wrecked 2005 Prius' data recorder showed no indication of brake compression.

122,"(CNN) -- The coming summer and fall could be an ""active to extremely active"" hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean, U.S. forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted. There is a 70 percent chance that three to seven major hurricanes will swirl in the Atlantic in the six months following the start of the hurricane season on June 1, according to NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. ""If this outlook holds true, this season could be one of the more active on record,"" said Jane Lubchenco, the under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere, and NOAA's administrator. The forecast predicts between 14 and 23 storms with top winds of 39 mph or higher, the threshold for tropical storm status. It predicts eight to 14 of those will become named hurricanes, with winds topping 74 mph or higher, and three to seven of those will become major ones, meaning Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Category 3 storms have sustained winds of at least 111 mph. Forecasters have said that El Nino conditions will dissipate by summer and that unusually warm tropical Atlantic surface temperatures will persist, leading to favorable conditions for hurricanes to develop and intensify. A report released in April by Colorado State University's forecasters William Gray and Phil Klotzbach also said that this year's hurricane season could be difficult, but they predicted only 15 named storms, eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes. Gray and Klotzbach will issue a revised forecast next Wednesday. A typical season has 11 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes, according to NOAA. The hurricane season ends November 30, although later storms have been known to happen. Last year's hurricane season was below average, with only nine named tropical storms, three of which were hurricanes.

123,"(CNN) -- Actor Gary Coleman, who had suffered from intracranial brain bleeding and was on life support in the intensive care unit of a Utah hospital, has died, a hospital spokeswoman said Friday. Family members and close friends were at his side when life support was terminated, Janet Frank said. Coleman, 42, fell ill at his Santaquin, Utah, home Wednesday evening and was rushed by ambulance to a hospital, the spokesman said in a statement released Friday. He was then taken to another hospital -- Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo -- later Wednesday night, the spokesman said. Coleman one of TV's brightest stars in '70s and '80s . The former child actor was ""conscious and lucid"" Thursday morning, but he ""was slipping in and out of consciousness and his condition worsened,"" the spokesman said. Coleman became unconscious and was placed on life support Thursday afternoon, the statement, which was released by the hospital, said. Coleman is best known as the wisecracking youngster Arnold Drummond on TV's ""Diff'rent Strokes"" from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. ""In recent years Gary Coleman has had difficulties, not only with health issues, but also with his personal and public life,"" his spokesman's statement said. ""At times, it may not have been apparent, but he always has had fond memories of being an entertainer and appreciates his fans for all their support over the years. At this critical moment, we can only ask for your thoughts and prayers for Gary to make a speedy and full recovery.""

124,"(CNN) -- A predicted busy hurricane season this summer is on a collision course with an unprecedented oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and the results are anyone's guess, weather experts say. ""The problem is that this is a man-made experiment we wish we hadn't made,"" said Jenni Evans, a professor of meteorology at Penn State University. Scientists on Thursday said as much as 19,000 barrels of oil have been spewing every day from the BP well in the Gulf, making it the largest oil spill in U.S. history. Most of the oily water lies off the coast of Louisiana, where marshes and wildlife have been coated and the state's fishing and tourism industries have taken direct hits. Not only is it hard to track how contaminants would be redistributed by a hurricane, but it's also hard to predict how the slick would affect the storm, NOAA Public Affairs Officer Dennis Feltgen and Evans agreed. Evans said the storm could either move the oil along the water's surface or it could mix the oil with the water and cause it to sink. If the oil moved horizontally, the shoreline would be polluted, she said. If it moved vertically, the marine life under the surface would suffer. The oil could slow the storm's growth, Feltgen said. Evaporated ocean water fuels hurricanes, and the oil forming a film across the Gulf could buffer the water from the air, preventing the ocean water from feeding the hurricane, he said. But other scientists say the storms could be stronger than usual because the black oil would heat the water faster and accelerate formation of hurricanes, which rely on warm waters for their development, Evans said. CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers said there was another threat from the volatile mix of hurricanes and oil: storm surge. ""All the winds would be coming here,"" he said, indicating the coast on a map, ""and there would be storm surge here. All the winds would be going this way, and there would be scouring and cleaning of the beaches on this side. But the storm surge that could make its way up and bring the oil miles inland could be completely contaminating the oil inland."" Oil in the Gulf coast isn't the only worry for hurricane forecasters this year: In earthquake-devastated Haiti, roughly 1.5 million displaced people are at risk. They are living under tarps and in tents in makeshift camps. In Haiti, aid agencies relocated about 20,000 people who were vulnerable to flooding and mudslides when the rainy season began. But it is impossible to hurricane-proof the congested tent cities that many are calling home right now, said Heather Paul, CEO of  the aid program SOS Children's Villages. Paul's program is working to provide permanent, stable homes to orphans in the form of polypropylene shelters. While her program's anchored shelters have the greatest potential to withstand strong winds, the outlook appears grim for many Port-Au-Prince residents. ""It's only short of a miracle to prepare these people for hurricane season,"" she said.","Hurricanes would pile on to problems of oil spill, Haiti quake survivors .

125,"Grand Isle, Louisiana (CNN) -- President Obama returned from a tour of the oil-stricken Gulf Coast on Friday and vowed to do all he could to help area residents and businesses clean up the mess and recover financially. ""We want to stop the leak, we want to contain and clean up the oil, and we want to help the people in this region return to their lives and livelihoods as soon as possible,"" the president told reporters. Flanked by more than a dozen Gulf-area politicians and officials, the president -- the sleeves of his shirt rolled up -- called the oil spill that began April 20 and continues today ""an assault on our shores, on our people, on the regional economy and on communities like this one. ""This isn't just a mess that we have got to mop up. People are watching their livelihoods wash up on the beach."" Obama said he had heard ""heartbreaking stories"" from Grand Isle Mayor David Camardelle of fishermen who are trying to figure out where their next paycheck will come from. ""This is something that has to be dealt with immediately,"" he said. ""This is our highest priority, and it deserves a response that is equal to the task. That is why this has already been the largest cleanup effort in U.S. history."" More than 20,000 people are working in the region to clean up the spill, including 1,400 National Guard troops activated in four states, he said. So far, more than 3 million feet of boom have been deployed, he said, adding that he will ensure that the lead federal official responding to the spill, Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen, gets ""whatever he needs to deal with this crisis."" Obama said it would be ""welcome news"" if BP's ""top kill"" effort succeeds in stopping the runaway flow from the well a mile below the surface of the water, but he said that that other efforts are under way, too. ""A team of some of the world's top scientists, engineers and experts -- led by our energy secretary and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu -- has for some time been exploring any and all reasonable contingency plans,"" he said. Obama said he has directed Allen and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to triple the manpower in places where oil has hit shore or appears within a day of doing so. Information about resources available to area residents and businesses will be posted at whitehouse.gov, he said. In addition, doctors and scientists will be stationed in the affected states to monitor the potential impact of the spill on the health of residents, an expense that BP will pay, he said. ""BP is the responsible party for this disaster,"" he said. ""But as I said yesterday and as I repeated in the meeting we just left, I ultimately take responsibility for solving this crisis. I'm the president, and the buck stops with me."" He added that federal authorities are prepared ""to do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to stop this catastrophe, to defend our natural resources, to repair the damage and to keep this region on its feet."" In a response to some local officials, who have been calling for a berm to be created to keep the water from getting into fragile marshlands, Obama said Allen is prepared to authorize moving forward with ""a portion of the idea."" And he called on Americans to help, too, by visiting the region. Except for three beaches in Louisiana, all of the Gulf beaches are open, safe and clean, he said. But it was to the long-term residents that he targeted his message: ""I'm here to tell you that you are not alone,"" he said. ""You will not be abandoned, and you will not be left behind."" Though about 25 percent of the Gulf of Mexico exclusive economic zone has been shut, most federal waters in the Gulf are open to commercial and recreational fishing, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.","Obama vows to put federal muscle behind cleanup, says there are alternatives to ""top kill""

126,"Washington (CNN) -- Survivors of the oil rig explosion April 20 that triggered an underwater oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico, along with the father of a man who died in the blast, urged members of a House committee Thursday to hold Transocean and BP accountable for the incident. ""Please believe me, no amount of money will ever compensate us for Gordon's loss,"" said Keith Jones, a Baton Rouge, Louisiana, attorney whose son, 28-year-old engineer Gordon Jones, died in the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon off the coast of Louisiana. ""We know that. But payment of damages by wrongdoers is the only means we have in this country to make things right."" Two employees of rig owner Transocean, meanwhile, accused the company of putting profits above lives and cutting back on safety and employees leading up to the explosion. When workers complained of needing more help, ""They just kept telling us they'd see what they could do,"" said engineer Doug Brown, 50, of Vancouver, Washington. Brown suffered head and leg injuries in the explosion and said he now struggles with short-term memory loss and post-traumatic stress disorder. Employee Stephen Stone told committee members that the explosion ""was hardly the first thing to go wrong"" on the rig. Both men described a horrific scene on board the Deepwater Horizon the night of April 20, with people crying and screaming for help as others scrambled for safety. ""I was pretty certain I was going to die,"" Stone said. After making it onto a lifeboat, being rescued by the Coast Guard and reaching land, some 28 hours after the explosion, survivors ""were lined up and made to take a drug test"" before being allowed to leave or call their families, Stone said. Transocean asked him to a sign a document -- without his attorney present -- saying he was not injured in the blast in exchange for $5,000 for the loss of his personal possessions, he said. He refused to sign the portion saying he was uninjured, he said, because even though he did not require medical treatment at the time, he must see a doctor for effects of smoke inhalation and is also dealing with mental and emotional aftereffects. Legal representatives for both BP and Transocean said the companies are making payment of claims a priority. ""We are going to pay all legitimate claims,"" said Darryl Willis, vice president for resources for BP America, who is handling claims against the company. ""We realize that we're going to be judged by our response to this spill, and we're going to pay for all damage to people, to governments, to the community."" BP has already paid out some $37 million in claims, he said, and has opened claim centers in Gulf Coast states. But Jones argued that the federal Death on the High Seas Act unreasonably limits the damages surviving family members can receive. He said the situation makes even less sense considering it was modified after the crash of TWA Flight 800 in 1996 to help the families of air crash victims recover damages. In one of the last pictures taken of Gordon Jones, he was giving his 2-year-old son, Stafford, his first golf lesson. His second son, Maxwell, was born two weeks ago, with his father represented in the delivery room by a family photo. ""There's nothing in the High Seas Act that can compensate the loss of a golf teacher,"" his father told CNN after the hearing. ""His sons are not going to have someone to teach them to give a man a firm handshake and look them in the eye."" He said his son's wife, Michelle, ""cannot recover for the loss of the love of her life."" ""The loss of Gordon's income is the last thing Michelle grieves for,"" he told Congress. ""When Michelle tells her boys about their dad, she is not going to show them a pay stub."" But under the current law, he said, that is all she and the older son are entitled to, and the baby may be entitled to nothing, because he was born after his father died. Jones said allowing punitive damages against companies like BP and Transocean is ""the only way they may learn."" Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood told committee members that Transocean has already filed a limitation action in preparation for lawsuits, and BP has filed to consolidate such suits. States are concerned they will be pulled into a class-action suit where they will be treated like any other plaintiff. Mississippi wants its legal issue debated in state court, not in courts somewhere else, he said. Transocean attorney Rachel Clingman said the majority of about 120 suits filed against the company thus far are class-action suits. Multiple lawsuits are confusing and can lead to disparate treatment for plaintiffs, she said. The company filed its limitation action for several reasons, she said. ""We believe that it is important to have a central venue for these actions and to maintain a degree of continuity and consistency in awards to plaintiffs that would not be possible if lawsuits go forward in courts throughout five states in various state and federal courts."" Asked by Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, about Stone's claims he was asked to sign a document, Clingman said a man ""who is not a lawyer"" met with Transocean employees in the days after the explosion and gave them a $5,000 check for their possessions. ""No release was signed,"" she said. ""No one has been asked to, or has, signed a release of liability,"" she said. CNN's Jessica Ravitz contributed to this report.","Transocean attorney denies company had employees sign releases .

127,"(CNN) -- The Minerals Management Service, a division within the Interior Department, was a troubled agency long before the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the recent revelations of employee misconduct. The agency -- which oversees U.S. offshore drilling, including the Gulf of Mexico -- has come under fire for mismanagement, questionable conduct and cozy relationships with industry officials. The MMS issued permits for the Deepwater Horizon drill rig -- contracted by BP -- which exploded on April 20. The explosion killed 11 people and resulted in an oil spill that is threatening parts of the Gulf. Interior Department Secretary Ken Salazar, during an appearance Wednesday before the House Committee on Natural Resources, said he was trying to change the agency's culture and its structure, which some critics say leads to mismanagement. ""My belief is that most of the employees of the MMS are good public servants,"" Salazar said. He, however, acknowledged some of the past conduct was ""scandalous"" and ""reprehensible."" Salazar said some people have been fired and others referred for prosecution. Two sources told CNN on Thursday that MMS Director Elizabeth Birnbaum has been fired. At a House subcommittee hearing Thursday, Salazar insisted Birnbaum had resigned ""on her own terms and own volition."" President Obama later said he didn't know whether Birnbaum was fired or resigned on her own. The Obama administration has said in recent weeks that many of the problems within the MMS were inherited from the Bush administration. Salazar, during his testimony and in his answers to members of Congress on Wednesday, also made that point. During the hearing, Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colorado, asked Salazar why he and other officials were ""harping on what MMS did or didn't do in the previous administration."" ""Why aren't we talking about the here and now?"" Lamborn asked. Salazar was blunt in his response. ""We've done a lot to clean the house at MMS, unlike the previous administration,"" he said. ""This is not the candy store of the oil and gas kingdom which you and others were a part of."" Conflict of interest? The MMS, which has about 1,700 employees, has two responsibilities when it comes to industries such as oil or natural gas. It must act as a regulator while also collecting royalties from the companies. Some critics say those are opposite pulls and make the agency ripe for mismanagement. The U.S. government technically owns resources such as the oil in the Gulf. Companies pay the federal government for the rights to drill in certain areas. The MMS collects and distributes about $13 billion a year, Salazar said. William Galston of the Brookings Institution said there is a built-in conflict of interest, resulting in lax regulation of involved companies. ""The MMS has a lot of incentive to collect as much, in the way of royalty income, as it can. That means pressure to authorize a lot of drilling and then to do everything possible [to make sure] that the flow of production is robust and unimpeded,"" said Galston, who recently wrote a piece critical of the MMS for The New Republic magazine. ""MMS, as it is currently structured, has to simultaneously put one foot down hard on the gas pedal and the other on the brake,"" he said. ""And the imperatives to go fast are a lot stronger than to slow down."" Salazar said organizational change within the MMS and a restructuring of the agency was necessary to deal with such conflicts. Salazar advocated plans to ""remove revenue collectors away from the leasing and policing functions of the MMS."" He then wants to create two bureaus within the MMS. One would be responsible for creating energy resources -- including oil and gas -- in the outer continental shelf. It would issue leases and collect royalties. The other would act as the policing arm of the agency, carrying out inspections and enforcing regulations. 'Misconduct, management and spills' ""MMS used to stand for Minerals Management Service. It now stands for misconduct, management and spills,"" said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, during the House hearing Wednesday. A report released this week from the inspector general's office at the Interior Department revealed federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored. The report said all the events detailed in it occurred before 2007. In one case, an inspector in the MMS office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company, the report said. Others let oil and gas company workers fill out their inspection forms in pencil, with the inspectors writing over those entries in ink before turning them in. The report also alleged employees at the same office received tickets to 2005 Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl football game from an offshore production company. The report also includes a confidential source informing investigators that a MMS inspector abused drugs, including crystal meth. In 2008, during the waning months of the Bush administration, Earl Devaney, then the Interior Department's inspector general, issued a report condemning the behavior of some of the agency's employees. ""The single-most serious problem our investigations revealed is a pervasive culture of exclusivity, exempt from the rules that govern all other employees of the federal government,"" the report said. The report said, between 2002 and 2006, some of the staff received gifts from oil and gas companies with whom they were conducting business. Some of the more salacious charges in the report included substance abuse and sexual relationships with industry contacts. 'The revolving door' Meanwhile, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, focused on the ""revolving door"" between industry and government. The ""revolving door"" refers to people who work in areas such as the oil industry, move to a government agency such as the MMS and then return to the private sector. Nelson proposed legislation that would have federal oil industry regulators wait at least two years after leaving government service before going to work for companies they helped regulate. Among other things, the bill would bar regulators from accepting gifts from oil companies. It also would require regulators to divest themselves of any stock they may currently hold in oil companies, and prohibit them from part-time employment in the industry. It is time, Nelson said Wednesday on the Senate floor, to ""stop this cozy, incestuous relationship between the oil industry and the regulators.""

128,"(CNN) -- The Gulf of Mexico undersea gusher is the largest oil spill in United States history -- possibly already more than twice as big as the Exxon Valdez spill, government estimates suggested Thursday. Scientists observed 130,000 to 270,000 barrels of oil on the water's surface on May 17, and think a similar amount had already been burned, skimmed, dispersed or evaporated. That would mean 260,000 to 540,000 barrels had leaked as of 10 days ago. The Exxon Valdez leaked about 250,000 barrels into Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989. The busted well is spewing oil at a rate of at least 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day, U.S. Geological Survey chief Marcia McNutt told reporters Thursday. A barrel of oil has 42 gallons, so that's 504,000 to 798,000 gallons a day. That's more than twice as much as previous estimates, which put the rate at 5,000 barrels, or 210,000 gallons, per day. It's also the more conservative estimate of two reached by two separate teams of government scientists who used two different methods, McNutt told reporters Thursday. One team looked at the oil on the surface and came up with the estimate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day. A second team used a different method and came up with a range of 12,000 to 25,000 barrels per day, McNutt said. The official estimate uses the range where the estimates overlap. The lower end of the government estimate -- 12,000 barrels per day -- would mean that about 18.6 million gallons of oil has been spilled since the April 20 oil rig explosion that started the leak. The higher end -- 19,000 barrels per day -- would mean 29.5 million gallons has been spilled. The Exxon Valdez spilled about 11 million gallons of oil. Worldwide, there have been more than a dozen bigger oil spills than the Gulf spill. The worst was the destruction of Kuwaiti terminals and tankers by Saddam Hussein's forces during the 1991 Gulf war, which spilled 240 million gallons, according to the Oil Spill Intelligence Report. The amount of oil spilled could have very specific financial ramifications for BP. If the government finds the company negligent or the leak avoidable, BP will owe royalties on the lost oil, Minerals Management Service spokesman Nicholas Pardi told CNN. ""Now we know the true scale of the monster we are fighting in the Gulf,"" said Jeremy Symons, senior vice president of the National Wildlife Federation. ""BP has unleashed an unstoppable force of appalling proportions. It's as if two Exxon Valdez tankers have already run aground, and more are on the way if they don't get this hole plugged. ""This independent government estimate shows what we expected all along -- BP cannot be trusted, because every gallon of oil that is spilled means they will pay more in fines and liability,"" Symons said. The estimates are preliminary and based on new methodologies, McNutt said in a teleconference. The first team, which got the lower estimate, analyzed how much oil was on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico on a given date, using aerial imaging. They estimated that ""130,000 to 270,000 barrels (were) on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico on May 17,"" McNutt said. ""We estimate that, in addition, as of May 17 a similar volume of oil had already been burned, skimmed, dispersed or evaporated,"" she said. That led those scientists to the range of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day. The second group used video observations to arrive at the higher figure. The scientific teams were composed of federal scientists, independent experts and representatives from universities around the country, McNutt said. BP, which owns the well, was not involved except to provide raw data, she said. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, David Mattingly and Courtney Yager, and CNN Radio's Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report.","Gulf spill significantly larger than Exxon Valdez accident of 1989, estimates indicate .

129,"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- Seven oil spill recovery workers who were hospitalized in New Orleans after complaining of feeling ill were properly trained and had protective gear on, according to the the federal on-scene coordinator for the oil spill response effort in the Gulf of Mexico. ""The heat and humidity in Louisiana can be challenging,"" Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry told reporters Thursday afternoon. She said the workers were treated for several symptoms, including headaches, nausea, vomiting and shortness of breath. Safety officials from the Coast Guard, BP and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration had responded to the incident, Landry. ""Basically, these folks all had the proper personal protective equipment on, and they all received the required training,"" she said. ""Fortunately, everyone is fine."" An investigation is under way ""to make sure what we can do to ensure that these workers are all working in safe conditions,"" Landry said. ""We will continue to monitor this situation very carefully so that nobody is put in harm's way as they respond to this spill,"" she added. A BP spokesman, John Curry, said the company takes ""worker safety seriously."" The company also said it has provided spill recovery workers with protective equipment, such as suits, steel-toed boots, gloves, hard hats and safety glasses. In addition, BP said, workers are conducting about 250 air-quality tests a day. They also are testing workers for exposure to irritants and other substances that could be harmful, BP said. The company also noted that testing has shown that ""airborne contaminants are well within safe limits."" The seven workers were at West Jefferson Medical Center in suburban New Orleans, said spokeswoman Taslin Alfonzo said. Five were discharged Thursday afternoon, she said. Based on their symptoms, the workers appeared to have come into contact with some type of irritant, Alfonzo said. However, the hospital doesn't have a toxicology department, so it couldn't identify the irritant. About 10 workers complained of feeling ill on Wednesday, prompting officials to recall more than 100 boats from an area adjacent to the Mississippi River delta. Lisa Faust with the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals said she believes as many as five were treated at the scene. Six of the seven were brought to the Marrero, Louisiana, hospital Wednesday night by ambulance, and the seventh was flown in. No additional patients have been admitted, Alfonzo said. The Unified Command -- a coalition of agencies including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Department of the Interior and the National Parks Service -- said Wednesday it recalled 125 vessels from Breton Sound, which lies about 50 miles southeast of New Orleans. The vessels were involved in cleaning up oil that has been gushing into the Gulf of Mexico since April, when an oil rig sank about 40 miles south of Louisiana, opening up a leak that has been gushing crude oil into the water. U.S. Rep. Charlie Melancon, D-Louisiana, again called on the federal government to deploy temporary clinics to south Louisiana to screen workers and relatives possibly affected by the oil. ""As I first alerted the federal government over a week ago, our workers and residents in the oil-affected areas of south Louisiana are facing a looming health crisis,"" Melancon said in a written statement. ""People are being exposed to hazardous oil fumes and potentially dangerous dispersants every day, and there is no health care infrastructure in place to treat them and monitor the situation."" Melancon said he will personally ask President Barack Obama to take action when Obama visits south Louisiana on Friday.","NEW: BP says it takes worker safety seriously .

130,"(CNN) -- A timeline of events leading to the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, according to documents from congressional investigators and testimony from witnesses to the disaster: . ^12:35 a.m. Oilfield services contractor Halliburton completes cementing on BP's Mississippi Canyon 252 well. In the hours leading up to midafternoon, crews conduct three positive pressure tests, in which fluid weight is placed on the seal. ^11 a.m. BP and Transocean executives argue over changes in the drill plan for the well at a meeting aboard the rig. ^5:05 p.m. An unexpected loss of fluid is observed in the riser pipe, suggesting there are leaks in the blowout preventer, a critical piece of equipment designed to shut down the well in the event of an emergency. ^5-7 p.m. Negative pressure tests, in which crews reduce fluid pressure to test for leaks through the cement or well casing, show unexpected results. One draws 15 barrels of liquid out of the well instead of the expected five, raising more concerns about leaks. In a second, pressure on the rig's ""kill line"" -- a high-pressure pipe used to cut off the flow of oil -- falls to zero, while rising to 1,400 pounds per square inch in the drill line, indicating a buildup of natural gas. ^8 p.m. BP ends testing and proceeds to replace remaining drill fluids with seawater. A BP investigator later suggests this is a ""fundamental mistake."" ^9:00 p.m. More fluid is reported flowing out of the well than is being pumped in. ^9:10 p.m. Well pump is shut down for a ""sheen"" test, but the well continues to flow. Drill pipe pressure unexpectedly increases. ^9:30 p.m. Abnormal pressures and more fluid returns are observed. The well pump is abruptly shut down. ^9:50 p.m. Gas surges from the well and up the riser. The supply ship Damon B. Bankston, which is tied up alongside Deepwater Horizon, reports drilling fluid spilling onto its deck and is told to move back 500 meters from the rig. Seconds later, the first explosion occurs. ^9:52 p.m. Deepwater Horizon issues distress call. The order is given to abandon the rig. Eleven of the 126 on board are lost at sea when the platform sinks two days later.","Documents from Congress, witness testimony detail events before leak .

131,"(CNN) -- Australia's iconic Tasmanian devil -- widely known as trouble in Looney Tunes cartoons -- has been put on the country's endangered list, environmental officials announced Friday. The Tasmanian devil's future is threatened by a contagious facial cancer that has killed large numbers. ""My decision to uplist the Tasmanian devil is based on advice from the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, which lists the devil facial tumor disease as the major threat to the devil,"" Environment Minister Peter Garrett said in a statement. ""This disease has led to the decline of about 70 percent of the Tasmanian devil population since the disease was first reported in 1996."" The disease has devastated the animals, native to the Australian state of Tasmania, an island off the southeastern coast. Devil facial tumor disease is one of only three cancers known to spread like a contagious disease, according to the Tasmanian government's Web site. As the name implies, it causes tumors on the face and neck, and sometimes other parts of the body, and it's passed by biting. The Australian government has committed $7.8 million over five years to the Save the Tasmanian Devil program, according to Garrett. ""This is to help with research into disease transmission and treatment, and will support captive and wild populations,"" he said. In 2005, the program established a captive breeding insurance population. Disease-free animals were gathered from the wild population and are being bred on the mainland. ""As of February 2009, the insurance population had grown to 145 disease-free Tasmanian devils"" at 10 zoos and wildlife parks, the Tasmanian government said. ""The animals in this breeding program could play an important role, if ever needed, in helping re-establish healthy wild populations in Tasmania."" Although the image of the Tasmanian devil has been popularized around the world by the Looney Tunes cartoon character Taz, the real thing is a much different animal. The devil, the world's only surviving marsupial carnivore, is about 25 pounds (12 kg) of bad attitude, with a haunting cry that's a combination of snorting and growling.","Australia's iconic Tasmanian devil has been put on the endangered list .

132,"Washington (CNN) -- The failure of General Electric engines on four jet aircraft overseas during the past two years has prompted the National Transportation Safety Board to issue an ""urgent"" recommendation to increase inspections of the engines on U.S. aircraft. None of the incidents resulted in crashes, injuries or fatalities. But in all four cases, engine parts penetrated the engine housing. Such ""uncontained engine failures"" are particularly dangerous because flying engine parts could puncture fuel or hydraulic lines, damage flight surfaces or even penetrate the fuselage and injure passengers. At issue are General Electric CF6-45/50 series jet engines, older engines found on a small number of jets. FAA officials said 373 of the engines are in service in the United States, on a fewer, but unknown, number of planes. The engines are used on some Airbus A300s, Boeing 747s, DC-10s, MD-10s and U.S. Air Force KC-10s. A GE spokeswoman said most of the engines are used on cargo planes. On four occasions, the NTSB said, a rotor imbalance caused rotor disks to fail, leading to the uncontained engine failures. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said the FAA is aware of the problem and issued a rule in March requiring inspections of the engines within 50 flights, and repeat inspections every 175 flights thereafter. It also is working on a rule that would add testing of the rotor disks for cracks. But on Thursday, the NTSB issued its urgent recommendation, saying the FAA should require inspections every 15 flights until the disks can be replaced with improved parts. The FAA said the action ""will maintain the safety of the fleet,"" and that it will decide whether to alter the inspection schedule after completing examinations of the engines involved in the recent incidents. GE spokeswoman Deborah Case said GE issued a service bulletin last August advising operators to inspect and monitor the engines. The NTSB recommendation follows these four incidents: . -- July 4, 2008: A Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) Boeing 747-300 experienced an engine failure after takeoff from Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. -- March 26, 2009: An Arrow Cargo McDonnell Douglas DC-10F, about 30 minutes after takeoff from Manaus, Brazil, experienced loss of oil pressure in one engine. The pilots shut down the engine and diverted to Medellin, Colombia. -- December 17, 2009: A Jett8 Airlines Cargo Boeing 747-200F was passing through 7,000 feet when the crew members heard a muffled explosion. With one engine losing oil pressure, the airplane returned to land at Changi, Singapore. -- April 10, 2010: An ACT Cargo Airbus A300B4 experienced an engine failure while accelerating for takeoff at Manama, Bahrain. The crew declared an emergency, aborted the takeoff, activated the fire-suppression system, and evacuated the airplane. The NTSB is participating in or leading investigations of the four incidents.","Engines on four jet aircraft overseas failed during the past two years .

133,"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Anti-whaling protesters hurled containers of butyric acid at a Japanese whaling ship in Antarctic waters, injuring four crew members, a Japanese official said Monday. Activists from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society hurl objects on to the Japanese ship Nisshin Maru. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society acknowledged the Sunday incident, saying it had lobbed more than two dozen bottles of rotten butter at the Nisshin Maru, ""sending a stench throughout the whale killing ship that will remain for days."" Butyric acid is found in rotten butter. The Sea Shepherd boat had to move a half-mile away from the whaling ship because ""it stinks too bad to remain any closer,"" activist Todd Emko of New York said in a statement from the group.  Watch protesters toss objects at the ship » . The conservation group said it also threw packets of a slippery chemical on to the deck of the ship, making it difficult to cut up whales. The unnamed substance becomes more slippery when mixed with water so it will be difficult to wash off the deck, a Sea Shepherd statement said. ""I guess we can call this nonviolent chemical warfare,"" said Capt. Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd boat, the Steve Irwin. ""We only use organic, nontoxic materials designed to harass and obstruct ... whaling operations."" Itsunori Onodera, Japan's senior vice minister for foreign affairs, described the incident at an international seminar for African and Asian delegates to the International Whaling Commission. He said the Sea Shepherd group threw bags of acid, rather than bottles of rancid butter. Onodera told the audience that the crew complained of injuries afterward, but he didn't elaborate. Sea Shepherd's U.S. office said it did not know of any injuries. Sea Shepherd interferes with Japanese hunts in an attempt to reduce the number of whales taken. In January, two activists from the group were seized when they boarded another Japanese whaling ship. Japan is lobbying a dozen members of the International Whaling Commission in Tokyo to support its much-criticized Antarctic whaling program. The effort comes before all 78 members of the panel this week in London, England. The commission is meeting to discuss reaching an agreement on whale conservation rules. Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Fisheries Agency are making their case to officials from Angola, Eritrea, the Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania, Palau, Micronesia, Cambodia, Laos and Vanuatu. Japan has said it is conducting the hunt as research, calling the practice environmentally and scientifically sound.  Watch why Tokyo is furious over the stink between whalers, protesters » . The country's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales a year; the Fisheries Agency insists it wants ""sustainable whaling."" However, many in the international community -- particularly Australia -- say such hunts amount to needless slaughter. Critics have said calling these hunts research is a pretext for retrieving whale meat to be sold in markets and restaurants.

134,"(CNN) -- Rust-colored oil washed ashore on barrier islands off Alabama and Mississippi on Tuesday, while more patches of crude offshore appeared to be moving toward those states' coasts, authorities reported. Researchers scrambled to clean up tar balls and puddles of oil from the beaches of Alabama's Dauphin Island, while a strip of oil about two miles long and three feet wide stretched along Petit Bois Island, about five miles away off Mississippi, Gov. Haley Barbour's office reported. It marked the first time oil has hit Mississippi's shores since the largest oil spill in U.S. history erupted in late April. And while tar balls associated with the Gulf spill had hit Dauphin Island, about 35 miles south of Mobile, in early May, residents said that Tuesday was the first time they had seen oil hitting the beach. Only part of the island's beaches have been lined with protective booms, with much of those barriers lined up near a protected wildlife area on the west end of the island. Annette Engel, a Louisiana State University researcher on Dauphin Island, said the oil is believed to be from BP's ruptured well off Louisiana. She predicted much more would be hitting the coast in coming days -- but vacationers remained on the beach, and some were still swimming in the blue-green waters as the cleanup continued. And researchers from the Dauphin Island Sea Lab spotted large patches of the reddish-brown ""weathered"" oil during a water-sampling expedition offshore Tuesday, said John Dindo, the laboratory's associate director. Dindo said the oil spots on the water ranged from the size of a half-dollar coin to 30 to 40 feet. A half-dozen boats could be seen skimming oil off the surface about 13 miles south of the island, he said. However, ""They were covering a very, very small spot in the ocean compared to what we saw,"" he said. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration had warned earlier this week that the spreading slick from an undersea BP oil well was heading toward the Alabama and Mississippi coasts. Dindo said tides in the area are running east and winds have been out of the southwest, driving the oil toward beach towns on the eastern side of Mobile Bay. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said earlier Tuesday that authorities were investigating reports that the outer sheen of oil was reaching coastal waters off Mississippi and Alabama, but said those reports had not been confirmed. ""We've dispatched survey teams to see what the impact is out there, and to the extent that is required, we'll move resources that direction,"" Allen, the federal government's national incident commander, told reporters in New Orleans, Louisiana. CNN's Patrick Oppmann and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Large patches of oil offshore .

135,"Washington (CNN) -- Authorities evacuated Union Station, the main train terminal in Washington, D.C., for part of Sunday afternoon due to a chemical odor from an overheated battery system, according to a spokesman for the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department. The evacuation ended just over an hour after it began, after a hazardous materials team responded and all train service had been suspended, said fire department spokesman Peter Piringer. One person was taken to a hospital for evaluation after complaining of dizziness, Piringer said. The odor, described as smelling like sulfur or natural gas, was due to the battery that backs up the train platform's lighting system getting overheated, the spokesman said. Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said all rail traffic in and out of the station was suspended for 75 minutes due to the evacuation. Delays from the temporary suspension would probably affect train service through the afternoon, Magliari said. Subway service continued to operate during the evacuation, but trains were not stopping at Union Station, according to the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority. Regular subway service was to resume shortly after the evacuation lifted.","Chemical odor causes hour-long evacuation at Washington, D.C.'s Union Station .

136,"(CNN) -- A new flow of oil emerged from BP's damaged undersea well in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday evening after a remote-controlled submarine successfully cut into the well's riser pipe. BP used robots in its latest attempt to curtail the flow of crude from the largest spill in U.S. history, which spread to barrier islands off Alabama and Mississippi on Tuesday. When the robot submarines cut into the undersea well's riser pipe, a fresh spew of oil temporarily obscured the view of the mechanical arm. The cut was a first step toward placing a cap over the well that has spewed hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico every day since late April. BP expects to make more cuts to the riser before bringing in a diamond saw to make a clean cut where the cap will be fitted. Doug Suttles, the company's chief operating officer, told CNN's ""John King USA"" that the procedure should collect the ""vast majority"" of the oil if it succeeds. ""We'll be putting the cap assembly, loading that out and sending it to the sea bed later tonight,"" Suttles said. ""We should be able to install this tomorrow. And hopefully by late tomorrow or Thursday, we should have this thing operating."" But the operation carries the risk that the flow of crude from the ruptured well could increase by up to 20 percent once the damaged riser is cut away. The job already has been complicated by pipework around the well that has had to be removed before massive metal shears could be brought to bear Tuesday evening, Suttles said. The gusher may not be shut down until August, when BP expects to complete relief wells that will take the pressure off the one now spewing into the Gulf. The 5,000-foot-deep well erupted after an explosion and fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20. The rig sank two days later, taking 11 men with it and leaving up to 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of oil pouring into the Gulf, according to federal estimates. After fouling sections of Louisiana's marshes over the past two weeks, the oil was spreading toward the northeast on Tuesday. Tar balls and patches of reddish-brown ""weathered"" oil came ashore on Dauphin Island, Alabama, south of Mobile, and on Mississippi's Petit Bois Island, off Pascagoula, authorities reported. Oil hits Alabama, Mississippi barrier islands . More than a dozen miles offshore, researchers from the Dauphin Island Sea Lab reported seeing more rust-colored swaths of oil spattering the surface of the Gulf. They ranged from the size of half-dollar coins to 30 or 40 feet long, said John Dindo, the laboratory's associate director. BP's handling of the spill has been sharply criticized by members of Congress, officials in the Gulf states and the Obama administration, which announced Tuesday that a criminal investigation of the spill was under way. In addition, federal officials will no longer hold joint news briefings with the company, the administration announced. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the government's point man on the spill, will now become the face of the response effort. Allen told reporters in New Orleans, Louisiana, that his job is to speak ""very frankly with the American public."" Rear Adm. Mary Landry, who has been the Coast Guard's on-scene coordinator for five weeks, will be returning to her duties as chief of the service's New Orleans district office. Allen praised Landry's work leading ""an anomalous and unprecedented response"" to the spill, but said Landry now needs to focus ""on the larger array of threats"" to her district -- including this summer's Atlantic hurricane season, which began Tuesday. In Louisiana, Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser warned that a hurricane in the area could drive more oil ashore. ""We don't want to scare anybody, but we need to be realistic about it,"" Nungesser said. ""If a storm does top out levees, it will probably bring oil with it."" He said residents who evacuate ahead of a hurricane might return ""not to a flooded home, but to a home that is completely contaminated with this oil."" Oil spill darkens hurricane fears . Tuesday also marked the start of the recreational fishing season for red snapper, a big draw for sport anglers in the region. But the season opened with a new blow to the region's fisheries industry as the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration extended its restrictions on fishing to almost a third of the Gulf. The closures extend southward to a point about 240 miles west of the tip of Florida and eastward to federal waters off the Alabama-Florida state line. The state of Mississippi announced a closure of some of its inland waterways to fishing after oil was found in the area. The closed area includes areas east of 88 degrees, 40 minutes west longitude, and south of the CSX Railroad, but not including Graveline Bayou and its tributaries. After a meeting with state attorneys general and federal prosecutors from Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters that the Justice Department was looking at possible criminal violations in connection with the spill. Justice Department launches investigation . ""If we find evidence of illegal behavior, we will be forceful in our response,"" Holder said. ""We have already instructed all relevant parties to preserve any documents that may shed light on the facts surrounding this disaster."" In a statement issued in response to Holder's announcement, BP said it would cooperate with any inquiry, ""just as we are doing in response to the other inquires that are already ongoing."" Suttles told CNN that there have been ""very few differences"" between company and federal officials working to cut off the spill. ""This is a team that's really all aligned on the same goals and has been since the beginning,"" he said. ""The government clearly presses us very hard to make sure we're responding as quick as we can. We're moving things forward, we're applying all the resources that we need to apply. But I would stress at the working level, those differences are really quite small."" BP, rig owner Transocean Ltd. and oilfield services company Halliburton have blamed each other for the disaster. But BP, as the well's owner, is responsible for the costs of the cleanup under federal law, and Suttles said the company has now spent more than $1 billion to clean up the oil. BP stock has taken a beating on Wall Street , plunging on Tuesday after the failure of last week's ""top kill"" attempt to close the well. The company's stock value is down more than a third since the spill began.

137,"San Salvador, El Salvador (CNN) -- The remnants of Tropical Storm Agatha were headed into the Caribbean Sea late Sunday after leaving behind more than 80 dead in Guatemala and El Salvador, authorities in those countries reported. Most of the dead were in Guatemala, where heavy rains triggered mudslides that collapsed homes and forced thousands to evacuate. The country's preliminary death toll was 73 on Sunday, with 49 of those reported in the province of Chimaltenango, said David de Leon, Spokesperson for the National Commission for the Reduction of National Disasters. That toll was expected to rise, he said. And El Salvador reported nine deaths from the storm. The government issued a red alert, the highest warning level, which shut down schools and opened up shelters for families in the affected areas, President Mauricio Funes said. Agatha, an Eastern Pacific storm, struck land Saturday and was downgraded from a tropical depression to a remnant storm on Sunday. It was last reported moving toward the western Caribbean on Sunday afternoon, but was expected to keep producing heavy rains through Monday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. In Guatemala, the storm damaged more than 3,500 homes and forced the evacuation of more than 61,000 people, the nation's emergency office said Sunday. And in Mexico, the government's National Meteorological Service predicted torrential rain for Chiapas state, intense downpours in Tabasco and strong showers in Quintana Roo. Four other Mexican states were predicted to receive moderate rain. Strong winds also were forecast. Swollen rivers and mudslides were a concern. In Guatemala, four children were buried in a landslide outside Guatemala City, the nation's capital. Four adults were killed in the capital, disaster officials said. Another two children and two adults were killed when a boulder, dislodged by heavy rains, crushed a house in the department of Quetzaltenango, 125 miles (200 km) west of Guatemala City, officials said. Guatemala is already under a 15-day state of calamity because of Thursday's eruption of the Pacaya volcano, which killed at least three people. At least 1,800 people had already been evacuated to shelters. The volcano also shut down the capital's international airport. Ash from the volcano that covered city streets and other areas mixed with the heavy rain, forming a goo that caused many drainage systems to clog. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said damage from Agatha was probably worse than the destruction caused by Hurricanes Mitch in 1998 and Stan in 2005, both of which devastated the Central American country. ""The country is suffering a great tragedy, this attack by nature,"" Colom said from the Guatemalan emergency agency center. Emergencies were reported in all of Guatemala's 22 states, called departments. The worst, Colom said, was the Pacific Ocean port of Champerico, which is isolated. ""We have no way of getting there to help the public, which is in danger because of flooding,"" Colom said. The president said he has asked the international community for help. Agatha is the first named storm of the Pacific hurricane season. The Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1.

138,"(CNN) -- The death toll from Tropical Storm Agatha continued to grow Tuesday, with 152 reported killed in Guatemala, 16 in Honduras and nine in El Salvador. One-hundred people are missing in Guatemala and another 87 are injured, the nation's emergency agency reported Tuesday. In addition, nearly 125,000 people have been evacuated and 74,000 are living in shelters, said emergency official David de Leon. The previously reported toll for Guatemala was 123 deaths, 90 people missing and 69 injured. Guatemala also is feeling the effect of the Pacaya volcano, which erupted Thursday night and continued to spew ash Tuesday. Three people were killed when they were crushed by rocks strewn by the volcano. La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City, the nation's capital, has been closed since Friday because of falling ash but was expected to open later Tuesday. Pacaya is located about 18 miles (30 kilometers) south of Guatemala City. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom declared a 15-day state of calamity after the volcano eruption. Damage from Tropical Storm Agatha added to the devastation. Destruction from the storm has been widespread throughout the nation, with mudslides destroying homes and buildings and burying some victims. At least nine rivers had dramatically higher levels and 13 bridges collapsed, the emergency services agency said. In the northern part of Guatemala City, the downpour created a sinkhole the size of a street intersection. Residents told CNN that a three-story building and a house fell into the hole. Classes have been canceled this week in schools throughout the nation. In Honduras, where 16 people have died, President Porfirio Lobo declared a state of emergency Sunday. Nearly 12,000 people have been evacuated from their homes and about 3,200 were living in shelters, the Honduran emergency agency said Tuesday. More than 140 homes have been destroyed and another 700 have been damaged, the Permanent Commission for Emergencies reported. The situation in El Salvador was improving, officials said Monday. The rain stopped Sunday afternoon and river levels were beginning to diminish, officials said. Classes nationwide remained canceled, however, until further notice. Agatha was demoted from a tropical storm to a tropical depression Saturday night and lost its status as a depression Sunday evening. It was the first named storm for the Pacific hurricane season. The Atlantic hurricane season started Tuesday. CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Death toll increases to 152 in Guatemala .

139,"Nashville, Tennessee (CNN) -- Tennessee is living up to its Volunteer State moniker as residents grapple with the aftermath of deadly flooding that left widespread damage and an untold number of displaced residents in its wake. Neighbors are rescuing neighbors. Strangers are chipping in to clean up devastated homes and businesses. Although many have lost everything tangible, their optimism remains intact. ""I'm alive,"" Ronnie Coleman said. ""Everything else, the rest of my life, if I have to fight cancer or whatever -- hey, man, it's going to be a piece of cake to what I went through."" After two days of torrential rain, Coleman waded through chest-high water this weekend at his home in the Whites Creek suburb of Nashville -- a daunting task for a man who can't swim. His neighbor, Willie Mae Stricklandjordan, whose every belonging was ruined in the flooding, described what happened when Whites Creek overflowed: ""The water just gushed in -- and it had a force to it."" Another neighbor, Evelyn Pearlbell, said she had to be rescued. ""They put this rope around me and pulled me through this water,"" she said. ""Scary. Phew, I was so scared."" As of Friday morning, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said that 21 people had died, one from natural causes. Davidson County was hit the hardest, with 10 fatalities. The federal government has declared 27 counties major disaster areas, the agency said. Aid and supplies were flowing in to Tennessee, including 167 truckloads of water. Country singers, who hold Music City USA dear, pledged monetary donations, and some converged on Nashville to help with the cleanup. Reports of rescues emerged from the Coast Guard, local rescue teams and average citizens as helicopters and boats canvassed the region for survivors. Nashville's police and fire departments were going door-to-door, making sure homes were evacuated. They tied yellow caution tape to the doors of places that had been cleared. Ben Perkins said he and his son, Will, searched for survivors for about seven hours in Bellevue on Sunday, rescuing people from the River Plantation subdivision and from stranded cars on a nearby highway. They initially took their boat to Will's great-grandmother's house, but she had been rescued, so Perkins began looking for others in need. Will manned a cellular phone, acting as a ""control center"" during the 15 to 18 rescue trips, his father said. ""Tennessee's come together. Nashville's come together,"" Perkins said. ""There's a lot of devastation. There's going to be a lot of need for donations."" Even with all the rescue operations, many residents had close calls. Betty Belle Nicks had to cling to a tree and then swim to the rooftop of her new home for refuge. Three small dogs made it to the roof and were saved, but Thursday night, she was looking for her yellow Labrador retriever, Ben, who swam away. ""If we could find Ben, it'd be the best wedding gift in the world,"" said Nicks, who was married last week. Jamye Howell was driving his Jeep through Hendersonville on Sunday when he drove over a bridge and through what he thought was a puddle -- just ""water standing on the road,"" he told CNN affiliate WZTV. ""Immediately, water was flowing in the car, and there was water flowing up on the windshield instantly,"" said Andrea Silvia, who was in the car with Howell. ""We decided that we needed to get out on top of the car and hope for the best,"" Howell told WZTV. The two swam about a mile to safety, they told the station. As the water continued to recede and rescue tales emerged Friday, many were struck by the devastation the flooding had wrought. Others still searched for loved ones, holding out hope that they may still be alive after almost a week. In Pegram, cadaver dogs searched Thursday along the Harpeth River for Danny Tomlinson, a 39-year-old amateur fighter who works for a prosthetics company. Friends and family members joined the effort, which had been ongoing for five days and had covered an almost 15-mile stretch of river. His car, which was swept away Saturday, was found Tuesday. A friend who was also in the car was found alive. Tomlinson's mother said, ""I'm trying to stay strong because I've got to have hope that they're going to find my son. I want to find him alive."" She pleaded to a higher power for help: ""Please, God, guide us. If he is in the water, which I don't want to think that, guide us there. Guide us to him -- for closure."" With more disaster declarations looming and residents and officials left to wonder the true toll of the weekend's deluge, several Tennesseeans said they felt confident that the area would persevere. ""Nashville has a spirit that won't be put down, so yes, I have no doubt that Nashville will come back,"" said Brenda Griffiths, who wore plastic bags over her feet as she assisted with the cleanup effort in Bellevue. Back in Whites Creek, evacuated residents said they feared returning home to see the devastation, but Reba Perkins said, ""We prayed that whatever we found, it would be something we could learn from."" Carolyn Phillips said the flooding left her worried about her future, but optimism had not escaped her. ""I'm going to be OK,"" she said. ""We're going to be OK."" CNN's Anderson Cooper, Martin Savidge, Gary Tuchman and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Tennessee officials say more than 21 dead, 27 counties labeled disaster areas .

140,"(CNN) -- Tiny diamonds found in the soil are ""strong evidence"" a comet exploded on or above North America nearly 13,000 years ago, leading to the extinction of dozens of mammal species, according to a study. Diamonds found in North American soil suggest a comet led to the extinction of dozens of mammal species. The scientific report also suggests the cataclysm also reduced the population of the earliest people to inhabit the region and triggered a 1,300-year-long cold spell that stretched around the world. The heat generated by the extraterrestrial impact likely melted much of a glacier that once covered the Great Lakes region, sending a massive flood down the Mississippi River, the study said. According to the report, the cold waves of glacial runoff into the Gulf of Mexico shifted Atlantic Ocean currents, changing climate patterns throughout the world in a cooling period known as the Younger Dryas. ""A rare swarm"" of comets rained over North America about 12,900 years ago, sparking fires that produced choking, leading ""to the extinction of a large range of animals, including mammoths, across North America,"" the report said. The study was conducted by a group of eight archaeologists and geologists from the universities of Oregon and California, Northern Arizona University, Oklahoma University and DePaul University. Their findings were published Friday in the journal Science. iReport.com: Have you ever seen a comet? Show us . The prehistoric humans known to have inhabited the continent at the time of the event -- hunters and gatherers dubbed the Clovis culture -- suffered a major decline in population in the aftermath, the scientists said. The scientists studied layers of sediment dated to 12,900 years ago at six North American locations, including one directly on top of a Clovis site in Murray Springs, Arizona. Each layer was rich in nanodiamonds, which are produced under high-temperature, high-pressure conditions created by cosmic impacts, the report said. ""The nanodiamonds that we found at all six locations exist only in sediments associated with the Younger Dryas Boundary layers, not above it or below it,"" said University of Oregon archaeologist Douglas Kennett. ""These discoveries provide strong evidence for a cosmic impact event at approximately 12,900 years ago that would have had enormous environmental consequences for plants, animals and humans across North America.""

141,"London, England (CNN)  -- A candidate for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) was injured Thursday morning in a light plane crash, police said. Nigel Farage, 45, suffered minor head injuries and was being treated at a hospital, his party said. Details of his injuries were not available. ""We've had unconfirmed reports that either the banner got snagged up or there were cross-winds and it was an unfamiliar airfield to the pilot,"" a UKIP spokesman said. It happened just after 8 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) at an airfield in southern Northamptonshire, near the Buckinghamshire constituency where Farage is running for election, Northamptonshire police said. The pilot, who was airlifted to a hospital, had to be cut out of the plane, the party said. Farage is currently a member of the European Parliament. He is running in Buckingham against 10 other candidates: Speaker of the House John Bercow (Conservative); Colin Dale (Monster Raving Loony Party); David Hews (Christian Party); Geoff Howard (Independent); Debbie Martin (Independent); Lynne Mozar (British National Party); Patrick Phillips (Independent); John Stevens (Buckinghamshire Campaign for Democracy); Simon Strutt (Cut The Deficit Party); Anthony Watts (Independent).","Police: Crash happened at an airfield in southern Northamptonshire .

142,"(CNN) -- What if carbon dioxide were as black as oil? When your house is on fire, you may not be in the mood to hear about an impending cancer epidemic that threatens your neighborhood, so I hesitate to bring up this topic. I have spent my scientific career studying oil spills, including the ongoing disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 people in the initial rig blast and is causing epic environmental damage, havoc to lives and livelihoods, political tumult, huge economic losses and an incessant media drumbeat. But while we have readily and rightfully committed ourselves to understanding the cause of the spill, its effects and how to help restore the affected Gulf Coast region, we still can't seem to come to grips with a much more dangerous, far-reaching pollutant that is changing the fundamental chemistry of our entire planet: carbon dioxide. Why the difference in concern? Is it as simple as out of sight, out of mind? We can see oil discoloring the ocean, blackening coastlines and covering wildlife, but carbon dioxide is colorless and odorless. We don't see it, and there's no video or sound bites, so it's easier to deny. CNN and other media outlets do not stream figures about carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. But it has been spewing steadily and increasingly for decades throughout our planet from power plants, factories and our cars and homes. Since 1960, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen from 310 to 390 parts per million. Our eyes are riveted to watching the black trail of oil soiling Gulf waters and coastlines. If carbon dioxide were black, we could actually see our atmosphere darkening with carbon dioxide, creating a heat-trapping blanket that is raising global air and ocean temperatures and threatening to dramatically rearrange our climate. Would we care more if we could see the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide being absorbed into our oceans, making seawater more acidic, endangering coral reefs and marine life and threatening to fundamentally disrupt ocean ecosystems and food webs? Perhaps we ignore carbon dioxide because it's hard for us to think long-term and connect the dots. The consequences of oil spills are immediate; the causes and effects are obvious. Not so with carbon dioxide; its consequences are incremental, insidious and irreversible for centuries to millennia. People don't easily understand how a small sea level rise can result in bigger storm surges and coastal damage, or how slight changes in ocean temperatures can change global rainfall patterns, leading to droughts and floods with catastrophic economic and societal consequences. Even if we acknowledge the problem, there's still the hurdle of doing something about it. It's almost the same as asking, ""If smokers could see their damaged lungs, would they quit more easily?"" Just the way some people blame that problem on tobacco companies for manufacturing the product, it is easier to target blame for oil spills on oil companies. But smokers choose to use cigarettes and often get addicted; similarly all of us who have been afforded the luxuries provided by cheap fossil fuels can't easily make difficult adjustments to wean ourselves away from them. (That doesn't excuse tobacco companies for marketing cigarettes without revealing their dangers or oil companies taking drilling risks without being prepared for the consequences.) The Gulf of Mexico spill is a reminder that oil doesn't come cheap. We will pay an enormous price in cleanup costs, economic losses and environmental and social damage. We don't factor in those costs when we fill our gas tanks. And we don't make the connection that gasoline, once burned, turns into its chemical sibling, carbon dioxide, whose effects on our environment will globally dwarf the catastrophe happening in the Gulf. Few people imagined a catastrophe on such a scale, but we now see it's possible and we are suffering the consequences. Our seemingly invulnerable planet is fragile, too. We ignore that at our peril.

143,"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- An autopsy report released Wednesday confirmed that a SeaWorld trainer killed after a 12,000-pound killer whale pulled her underwater died of drowning and traumatic injuries to her body, including her spine, ribs and head. Dawn Brancheau, 40, was working with a whale named Tilikum in knee-deep water at SeaWorld in Orlando on February 24 when the animal grabbed her by the ponytail and pulled her underwater in front of shocked onlookers at the park's Shamu Stadium. The autopsy report by the Orange County, Florida, medical examiner's office says Brancheau's spinal cord was severed, and she sustained fractures to her jawbone, ribs and to a cervical vertebra, in addition to the drowning. Rescuers were not immediately able to reach Brancheau because of the ""whale's aggressive nature,"" the county sheriff's office said. SeaWorld staff members recovered Brancheau after Tilikum was coaxed into a smaller pool and lifted out of the water by a large platform on the bottom of the smaller tank, authorities said. Video shows Tilikum performing before attack . A source at SeaWorld told CNN in February that after seizing her, the whale dove deep underwater. Brancheau's body was recovered about 40 minutes later. Tilikum has been linked to two other deaths. He and two other whales were involved in the drowning of a trainer at a Victoria, British Columbia, marine park in 1991. The trainer fell into the whale tank at the Sea Land Marine Park Victoria and was dragged underwater as park visitors watched. In 1999, Tilikum was blamed for the death of a 27-year-old man whose body was found floating in a tank at SeaWorld, the apparent victim of a whale's ""horseplay,"" authorities said then. The Orange County Sheriff's Office said the man apparently hid in the park until after it closed, then climbed into the tank. Because of Tilikum's history, as well as his size, trainers did not get into the water with him and specific procedures were in place for working with him, SeaWorld officials have said. Two days after Brancheau's death, the head of SeaWorld said Tilikum ""is a wonderful animal"" and ""will remain an active and contributing member of the team despite what happened."" ""He's a very special animal that requires special handling,"" said Jim Achison, president of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment. ""Obviously, the procedures that we've had in place are something we're revisiting at this point."" Tilikum's size and weight -- 12,000 pounds, compared with 6,000 to 9,000 pounds for the facility's other killer whales -- were one reason separate procedures were in place for him at the Orlando facility.","NEW: Whale's aggressive nature prevented rescuers from immediately reaching trainer .

144,"(CNN) -- Pilots were warned of potential danger at least eight times in about 30 seconds before a Polish jet crashed in Russia in April, killing President Lech Kaczynski and about 100 others. A transcript that the Polish government released Tuesday shows that an automated warning system sounded the alarm several times before the Tupolev-154 crashed in western Russia. ""Pull up. Pull up,"" a warning system advised pilots. ""Terrain ahead. Terrain ahead."" The April 10 crash killed Kaczynski, his wife, top Polish military officials, the head of Poland's national bank and other dignitaries. The president had been traveling with a Polish delegation to Russia for the 70th anniversary of the massacre of Polish prisoners of war in the village of Katyn. Some 20,000 Polish officers were executed there during World War II.","Transcript shows pilots warned of danger several times in seconds before crash .

145,"(CNN)  -- From victims of gunshot wounds and domestic violence to common road injuries, Trinite Hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti is inundated with trauma cases daily. A mother and child in the recovery room of Trinite Hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The stream of patients arriving at the free clinic run by international aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres is virtually uninterrupted. Some arrive in police ambulance or via the Haitian Red Cross; others are dropped off in wheelbarrows, according to Brian Phillip Moller, head of the 60-bed trauma center. Gunfire no longer fills the nights the way it did when he was last in Haiti in 2006, but the workload for aid workers hasn't diminished. Instead hospitals like Trinite are dealing with trauma cases the public health system is incapable of handling, Moller tells CNN. While the security situation in Haiti has improved during the last two years, the public health system remains in disarray, according to Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders. The organization, which offers free care at three clinics in Port-au-Prince, says basic health services are practically non-existent in the capital city, the result of a public health system marred by mismanagement, strikes and shortages of medical personnel and supplies. ""The Haitian system is at breakpoint,"" says Moller. The private health care sector has developed in recent years, but most in poverty-stricken Haiti cannot afford to pay the fees charged for services. MSF is urging the international community to increase pressure on Haiti to improve its health system. The call comes as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Haiti's Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis and representatives of donor countries are set to meet in Washington Tuesday to discuss international assistance for the country. With the public health system underfunded and understaffed, patients often have nowhere to turn but to free clinics. An obstetrics hospital run by MSF in Port-au-Prince manages 40 percent of the childbirth-related emergencies among poor women in the city. At Trinite, doctors treated nearly 18,000 trauma cases last year. The hospital's bed occupation rates are at 100 percent and at times staff have no choice but to refer patients to public health facilities that they know are inadequate.

MSF France, which runs the Trinite trauma center, plans to withdraw from Port-au-Prince next year, which could make the situation for Haiti's poorest even more dire. Urban conflict has subsided, reducing the need for a war surgery hospital, Moller says. About one-third of the cases at the hospital are related to road vehicle accidents. The group's mission is to provide urgent care to crisis-hit areas, he says, not cope with everyday trauma. Although the security crisis has abated, violence, is still very much a part of life in Haiti's capital city and poses a major health care challenge. One in five cases admitted to the Trinite are violence related. ""Access to adequate health care is a basic human right and it is definitely not being met here in Haiti. The issue needs to be addressed very quickly. People are dying needlessly and will continue to unless this issue is addressed,"" Moller says.","Medecins Sans Frontieres says public health system in Haiti failing patients .

146,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The pilot of a small Cessna 172 aircraft reported stolen from a Canadian flight school has been captured, authorities said. The pilot was flying a plane similar to this one -- a Cessna 172 -- before he landed in Missouri. The pilot reportedly stole a small Cessna 172 aircraft from a Canadian flight school, flew hundreds of miles across the Midwest, landed on a dirt road in Missouri late Monday and took off on foot, federal officials said. Federal, state and local authorities launched a manhunt for the pilot, who was identified by the FBI as Adam Leon, 31, a native of Turkey who became a Canadian citizen last year, according to FBI spokesman Richard Kolko. He was formerly known as Yavuz Berke, though officials did not indicate a reason for the name change. He was taken into custody at an Ellsinore grocery story after a brief manhunt, according to Missouri state police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A federal law enforcement source said the pilot parked the plane under what appeared to be a bridge or culvert, apparently in an attempt to hide it. The plane had been intercepted and tracked by U.S. military aircraft as it flew from Canada into U.S. airspace and meandered southward for several hours before landing, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman said. It landed in the town of Ellsinore, population 360, in southern Missouri, a dispatcher with the Carter County Sheriff's Office said. A spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said the pilot flew ""erratically"" over the course of the afternoon, at time reaching 14,000 feet in altitude, then dropping as low as 3,000 feet. The Cessna departed the school in Ontario at about 3 p.m. ET and flew over Lake Superior less than half an hour later, according to NORAD officials. F-16 fighter jets intercepted the pilot near Michigan's upper peninsula border with Wisconsin at 4:43 p.m., and tracked the Cessna until its safe landing. The NORAD spokesman, Mike Kucharek, said military pilots who intercepted the Cessna had tried repeatedly to get the pilot's attention and at one point, the pilot appeared to acknowledge that he saw the other aircraft. ""He looked at them,"" Kucharek said. But the pilot had not communicated with NORAD or the Federal Aviation Administration, Kucharek added later in the evening. At 9:20 p.m., the pilot was believed to have had roughly 30 minutes of fuel left, Kucharek said. ""We don't want to suppose the motive of the individual,"" Kucharek told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" after the landing. ""But it certainly made a day for the professional pilots that were flying these missions and a very serious situation from a NORAD perspective."" Officials allowed the pilot ""to play his hand"" because they ""[didn't] want to provoke the situation,"" Kucharek said. A federal law enforcement official told CNN the pilot is a naturalized Canadian citizen, but declined to give his name or country of origin. The source said the pilot was a flight school student for a ""brief"" period and only clocked a few hours of flight time. Canadian officials have received some information that the pilot is ""not a happy individual,"" the official said. The Cessna departed at about 3 p.m. ET and flew over Lake Superior less than half an hour later, according to NORAD officials. F-16 fighter jets intercepted the pilot near Michigan's upper peninsula border with Wisconsin at 4:43 p.m., and have tracked the Cessna since. Earlier in the evening, the Wisconsin National Guard deployed two F-16s of its own in an attempt to get the pilot to establish communications with FAA air traffic controllers. The state capitol in Madison, Wisconsin, was evacuated for less than an hour as a precaution. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said the plane was reportedly stolen from a flight school in Thunder Bay, Canada, and the pilot had been identified as a student at the flight school. Both Lt. Cmdr. Gary Ross of NORAD and Brown of the FAA said the 14,000-feet altitude is above the level at which the FAA requires use of oxygen. Brown said it was not clear whether the Cessna had supplemental oxygen on board. Ross says the plane is a long-range version of a Cessna 172. It was fully fueled, giving it about seven hours of flying time. Ross said if NORAD officials believe the aircraft poses a threat, ""we take seriously any intent to harm any of our citizens or critical infrastructure."" He added that ""all options are on the table although we continue to move towards a resolution that doesn't call for [lethal force].""

147,"(CNN) -- Foreign governments should urgently accept Haitian orphans on humanitarian grounds following this week's devastating earthquake, an orphanage director in Haiti and adoptive parents said Friday. Emergency visas and passports could help push through adoptions that were stalled after the quake, and would open up beds for children who lost their parents in the disaster, said Dixie Bickel, director of God's Littlest Angels orphanage just outside Port-au-Prince. Paperwork for adoptions that were under way when the earthquake hit Tuesday night may now be buried in the rubble of collapsed buildings and lost, said Bickel, whose orphanage cares for 152 children, including 84 babies. The government officials who deal with adoption cases may be missing, hurt, or otherwise focused on the disaster, which means the adoptions won't go through, she said. ""I would like to see the international community come up with a plan for the children that have been adopted by European, Canadian, and American citizens of how these children can go to their adoptive parents' countries, either under refugee status or emergency status of some sort,"" Bickel told CNN. God's Littlest Angels is considered one of Haiti's larger orphanages. Parents who have adopted children through the orphanage are also pressing their governments for emergency action. ""The orphans need to be granted refugee status and allowed to come home to their adoptive parents,"" said Allison Garwood of Los Angeles, California, who adopted a boy from GLA and brought him home last year. ""The U.S. needs to not only allow but demand that children be sent to their adoptive families right away."" British citizen Chris Skelton, who arrived in Haiti hours before the earthquake hit to sign paperwork as part of the adoption process, wrote a public letter urging foreign help. ""I cannot express the sheer magnitude of the plight that the children of this country have faced, one which will now spiral downwards further with devastating results,"" Skelton wrote in the letter. ""The situation is dire -- there will be many more children in need of help, and GLA and other orphanages cannot cope with the increased need."" The foreign ministries of Britain, Belgium, and France said they could not immediately respond, but Luxembourg's Foreign Ministry said it was aware of the issue. ""The Luxembourg authorities are informed of the situation of Miss Bickel and the children at the orphanage God's Littlest Angels, and our authorities are in touch with the Red Cross and the local authorities to solve the issue,"" spokesman Robert Steinmetz told CNN. Bickel said her request is only for those children who have been adopted but who are still in Haiti as their cases go through a lengthy government approval process which can take anywhere from six months to two years. The children's paperwork may have been in the pipeline but after the quake, the status is now unclear, Bickel said. ""Some of my papers were in the Palace of Justice -- that building is no longer there,"" she said. ""Some of my paperwork was in the Ministry of the Interior -- I don't know if that building is there. I had passports being printed (for the children). I don't know if the paperwork is still there."" Bickel said her lawyer told her the country's top adoptions official, Judge Rock Cadet, was killed when the courthouse collapsed. As long as the adopted children can make it out of the country, Bickel said, the orphanage can ensure the children's paperwork is completed in Haiti. If the children can't leave the country, it will mean orphanages like Bickel's must turn away any children newly orphaned by the earthquake, she said. ""It leaves me with children in my care who are going to sit here for an additional five, six months at least,"" she said. ""It's going to prevent me from taking in any children that were affected by this disaster. My beds are full. I can't take any children in, not unless I put them on the floor or I put two or three children to a bed.""","Orphanage head urges governments to accept Haitian children for adoption .

148,"(CNN) -- Actor Gary Coleman, who had suffered from a brain hemorrhage from an accident in his home Wednesday, died Friday in a Utah hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said. Family members and close friends were at his side when life support was terminated at 12:05 p.m. (2:05 p.m. ET), Janet Frank said. Coleman's wife, Shannon Price, issued a short statement Friday afternoon saying details of how the former child actor died will be made public later. ""Now that Gary has passed, we know he will be missed because of all the love and support shown in the past couple of days,"" Coleman's spokesman, John Alcantar, said in a written statement. ""Gary is now at peace and his memory will be kept in the hearts of those who were entertained by him throughout the years."" Coleman, 42, was rushed by ambulance to a hospital after the accident in his Santaquin, Utah, home Wednesday, Frank had said in a statement released earlier Friday. Later Wednesday night he was taken to another hospital -- Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo -- where he had been listed in critical condition, she said. While Coleman appeared ""lucid and conscious"" Thursday morning, his condition worsened by the afternoon, leaving him unconscious and on life support, she said. Coleman is best known as the wisecracking youngster Arnold on TV's ""Diff'rent Strokes"" from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. ""There was a touch of magic and a different stroke in Gary Coleman,"" said TV legend Norman Lear, who produced the show. ""He was the inspiration behind his show's title.""","NEW: Coleman's brain hemorrhage was caused by an accident at home .

149,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- The mother of a Spanish man who died from the human form of mad cow disease has also died from the illness, Spain's Ministry of Health said Wednesday. Spain has taken steps to avoid mad cow disease, and there is no danger from eating meat, officials said. It is believed to be the first case in the world where two members of the same family have died from mad cow disease, said Juan Jose Badiola, director of Spain's national research center for mad cow disease. ""It's noteworthy that there's a double case in the same family,"" Badiola said. Until now, Badiola added, clinical evidence that he's seen from the United Kingdom and France -- which have had the most deaths due to the human form of mad cow disease -- have not recorded two cases in a single family. The mother, in her early 60s, died last month. The government confirmed Wednesday that it was because of mad cow disease but did not, by custom, make her name public. Her son, 41, died in February from the same disease, Badiola said. The latest confirmed case makes a total of four deaths in Spain from mad cow disease since 2005. Three of these cases in Spain were in the same northern province, Leon, which is another unusual aspect that will be studied, Badiola said. Ten years can pass between eating contaminated tissue and the appearance of the human form of the disease, called variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, health officials say. The health ministry said there is no danger from eating meat in Spain, because of existing controls. The steps to avoid the disease, taken after the first cases of mad cow disease appeared in the United Kingdom, included isolating infected animals and prohibiting cattle feed of animal origin or with animal proteins, the ministry said. ""The appearance of these sporadic cases is within the predictions that were made at the European level more than eight years ago,"" the ministry statement said. Badiola said that it's likely the mother and son contracted the disease before stricter controls against mad cow disease began in 2001 in Spain. The pair had similar eating habits, Badiola said, which included eating animal organs, such as kidneys and livers, and they may also have eaten animal brains. Researchers will try to determine whether the mother and son shared a genetic structure that might have been more prone to contracting the illness, Badiola said. The family's home was in a village near the provincial capital of Leon, 333 kilometers (206 miles) northwest of Madrid. The other case in that province was of a woman, 50, who was a local government worker in the provincial capital. She died in December from mad cow disease. The first confirmed death from mad cow disease in Spain was in 2005, when a young woman died near Madrid. In addition to the cases in Spain, as of June the following numbers of cases of human mad cow disease had been reported: 167 in the United Kingdom; 23 in France; four in Ireland; three in the United States; two each in Netherlands and Portugal; and one each in Canada, Italy, Japan and Saudi Arabia . Two of the three U.S. cases, two of the four cases in Ireland and the single cases in Canada and Japan were people probably exposed to the mad cow agent while residing in the United Kingdom, officials have said. One of the 23 French cases may also have been infected in the United Kingdom.","Expert: First case where two members of same family died from mad cow disease .

150,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Staten Island Ferry lost power and hit a pier Wednesday at full speed, resulting in one serious injury and nine minor injuries, a Coast Guard spokesman said. The New York Fire Department estimates that 750 to 800 passengers were aboard the Staten Island Ferry. Coast Guard boats were on the scene, the St. George Terminal on the north shore of Staten Island. The Coast Guard spokesman compared the ferry's loss of power as it neared the pier to a car losing its brakes. The hard landing occurred at 7:10 p.m., according to the Coast Guard. The New York Fire Department estimated that 750 to 800 passengers were aboard. The impact did not send any passengers overboard, the spokesman said.

151,"(CNN)  -- Heavy rains and hurricane-force winds that surpassed 70 miles per hour in places toppled trees, left more than half a million people without power, and suspended travel throughout much of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic region Saturday night. Four inches of rain fell in parts of the region, and the National Weather Service extended storm and flood warnings for much of the area into Sunday. ""This storm is such a slow mover that it's not going to pull out probably until Monday,"" said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. ""There's another whole day to get through with heavy rain and strong winds."" Some areas will see an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain by Sunday, Jeras said, though winds are expected to die down to a maximum of 30 miles an hour. Power outages darkened much of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. New Jersey's PSE&G electric company said 136,000 customers were without power Saturday night, while Long Island Power Authority said close to 190,000 customers lacked electricity. ""The ground is so wet from all the snow we've had this winter, it's helping the trees to topple over, as well as our utility poles,"" said Long Island Power Authority president and CEO Kevin Law. ""The conditions are still too terrible to get crews out there."" Law said that some customers will likely go without power until early next week. Con Edison reported 97,000 customers without power in New York City and Westchester County, while other electric companies in the region reported tens of thousands more were in the dark. Amtrak suspended trains between New York and Philadelphia because of issues with overhead wires and power outages. About 10 Amtrak trains were affected. New Jersey Transit stopped train service for the majority of its system, including the Northeast Corridor, North Jersey Coastline, Raritan Valley, and Atlantic City Rail lines. A New Jersey Transit spokeswoman said many trees have fallen on overhead wires. Boston's Logan International Airport diverted flights due to weather and there were reports of major delays at airports throughout the Northeast. Across the region, trees and utility poles crashed onto houses and cars. Part of a crane collapsed at a construction site in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The New York police department brought in additional 911 operators Saturday to handle the surge in emergency calls.","Four inches of rain and winds topping 70 mph recorded in parts of the Northeast .

152,"(CNN) -- Passenger David Martin knew the situation on Virgin America Flight 404 was unraveling Saturday when members of the flight crew began snapping at passengers. One incident stands out for him from Saturday's flight, which spent more than four hours on the tarmac at New York's Stewart Airport after being diverted from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Martin said he was rationing a limited number of cookies from first-class to mothers and children in coach when a passenger prone to outbursts asked him for a cookie. He was about to give her one when a flight attendant ordered her to sit down and told her she would not get a cookie. ""Everyone knew she was a very frantic woman, which is why no one said anything when she asked for the cookie. ... Everyone understood but the flight attendant,"" said Martin, CEO of the social networking site Kontain.com, who documented Saturday's travails using visual updates via the iPhone app to his Kontain account. ""I went to her and said, you need to understand that speaking to passengers like this is not going to do any good. You need to exercise leadership and responsibility."" Martin said the flight attendant dismissed his words, as did the pilot when he took his concerns to the cockpit. See Martin's visual posts from flight on Kontain.com . Martin said the situation did not improve until the flight was finally canceled, 4½ hours after it parked at Stewart and nearly 12 hours after it took off from Los Angeles International, during which time passengers say they endured shortages of food and water, crying babies, panic attacks and rising tensions. Severe storms and heavy winds paralyzed traffic entering and leaving JFK airport Saturday night, causing most flights to be diverted. ""Although we cannot control the weather or the circumstances, we agreed that we needed to have done a better job with making our guests more comfortable in a difficult situation,"" Virgin America spokeswoman Abby Lunardini said in an e-mail. But if the delay had occurred a few weeks later, Virgin America might have faced more than $3 million in fines for staying on the tarmac for more than three hours. Under the rule, which takes effect April 29, airlines could be fined up to $27,500 per passenger for tarmac delays lasting more than three hours. Passengers were offered two opportunities to leave the plane after it parked on the tarmac at Stewart, and 20 of the 126 passengers chose to do so, Lunardini said. Internal policy dictates that Virgin America will never hold guests longer than three hours without the ability to leave the aircraft, she said. ""Although guests were able to leave the aircraft during Flight 404, if the ruling were in place we would have made the decision to cancel at the 2-hour mark instead of the 3- to 4-hour mark, which is our current practice,"" Lunardini said. ""We are in full compliance with existing rules and are prepared to be in full compliance with the new ruling when it is issued."" The Department of Transportation is investigating the Virgin America incident, said spokesman Bill Mosley. ""The whole thrust behind the rule is to prevent passengers from being subject to that, to the delays in the aircraft,"" Mosley said. American Airlines has joined JetBlue and Delta in requesting an exemption at JFK airport to the tarmac delay rule set, according to the Department of Transportation. The closure of a major runway at JFK prompted the exemption requests, which would only apply to that airport for the duration of construction on the runway. Even in situations when the flight cannot operate, the rule would ensure that passengers are allowed to get off the plane and return to the terminal, Mosley said. American echoed the concerns of JetBlue and Delta in its JFK exemption request. ""Carriers, faced with increased operational difficulties as a result of constrained runway capacity just at the time the new tarmac delay rule goes into effect, and with the prospect of incurring $27,500 per passenger in fines, will inevitably cancel flights during challenging operational situations,"" the airline's DOT request said. Martin said he supports the idea of fining airlines for delays as an incentive to ensure that other passengers don't have to endure the same experience. ""I would like on my left to be the CEO of Virgin America and on my right, the CEO of JetBlue to vouch with me for this bill,"" he said. ""That's the kind of leadership that's required and demonstrates that these CEOs understand that passenger safety and customer service comes first."" Martin and his seatmate, ""Dancing with the Stars"" judge Carrie Ann Inaba, used Twitter and Kontain, respectively, to issue updates on their ordeal. ""Was stuck on a plane for five hours on a Tarmac. They ran out of food, a woman was escorted off by police and I'm grateful to new friends,"" Inaba tweeted at 11:14 p.m., after the flight was officially canceled and remaining passengers were led off the plane. Read Inaba's Tweets . Martin posted intermittent updates to Kontain.com using his iPhone app while the flight was in progress. ""Tensions rising big time as we are grounded and passengers are trying to get off,"" he said in one post accompanied by a photo of passengers lining up in front of the cockpit to deplane. ""Virgin crew losing control of passengers. Police now onboard here,"" he said in a later post. On Sunday night, Martin says he received a phone call from Virgin America CEO David Cush telling him that he'd seen his posts and expressing apologies. Martin attributed his use of social media to convey the severity of the situation as a factor in Virgin America's decision to refund passengers the cost of the airfare plus a $100 credit. ""You can't just write in a complaint or call customer service anymore... social media, it's the only weapon,"" he said. ""Airlines need to be more terrified of that than the actual bill, because they're going to have to compensate passengers anyway each time they get held up on the tarmac, but they're also going to lose passengers because their brand will be destroyed every time a passenger uses social media.""","Five-hour flight lasts more than 10 after severe weather diverts it .

153,"Muscat, Oman (CNN) -- Cyclone Phet weakened as it churned along coastal Oman Friday, dumping up to 25 centimeters (10 inches) of rain on the region. Phet, once a powerful Category 4 storm, has been downgraded to Category 1 with winds of about 140 km/hr (86 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Yet Phet brought massive flooding to Muscat and whipped the capital with winds gusting above 200 km/hr (125 mph) at the height of the storm. The storm is forecast to reenter the Arabian Sea late Friday or early Saturday before making a projected landfall near Karachi, Pakistan, Sunday. In Pakistan, authorities dispatched Navy helicopters to alert fishermen near Karachi and parts of Balochistan to the expected arrival of Cyclone Phet and to urge them to return to shore, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported Thursday. Navy units were on high alert should they be needed in the aftermath of the cyclone. Fourteen families marooned Thursday by high tides were evacuated by helicopter to higher ground, said Pakistani Chief of Naval Staff Adm. Nauman Bashir. Civilians along Pakistan's coast will receive priority in the relief effort, dubbed ""Operation Madad,"" should it be needed, he said. The Pakistan navy secured its ships near the threatened areas, Deputy Chief of Naval Staff (Operations) Vice Adm. Abass Raza told reporters in Islamabad. ""All the assets of Pakistan navy are safe and necessary precautionary measures have been taken to ensure their safety in case cyclone Phet hits the coastal areas of country,"" he said.","Phet dumps heavy rain along coast of Oman .

154,"(CNN) -- The leading edge of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill was still several miles off the beaches of the Florida Panhandle on Thursday morning, but the slick was already hitting the area's wallets. ""The phones just basically stopped ringing in the past couple of weeks for new bookings this summer,"" said Laura Lee, a spokeswoman for the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Florida's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spotted oil sheen about six miles off Navarre Beach, east of Pensacola, on Thursday morning, according to the state Division of Emergency Management. Any oil that hits shore is likely to have been weathered into balls or mats of tar, or mixed with seawater in a pudding-like ""mousse,"" the agency reported. As of late Thursday morning, no oil or tar balls had washed up, said Buck Lee, executive director of the Santa Rosa Island Authority in Pensacola Beach. Lee, who is not related to Laura Lee, said the area had just had a ""super"" Memorial Day weekend -- but now, ""We're just waiting anxiously to see what happens,"" he added. Laura Lee said a wave of hotel cancellations hit the island in late April, after the sinking of the offshore drill rig Deepwater Horizon uncapped an undersea oil well off Louisiana. Those tapered off soon afterward, she said -- ""But this week, there's been another wave of cancellations,"" Laura Lee said. Hotels have responded to the threat by easing cancellation policies. ""Some had guarantees that they would get their money back if there was oil,"" she said. Families weigh Gulf Coast vacations . In addition, charter fishing -- another big business in the area -- has been hurt. Some skippers have gone to work for oil company BP, which has hired boats to help lay protective booms and skim oil off the surface of the Gulf. Tourism pumped about $1.2 billion into the Escambia County economy in 2009, employing roughly 20,000 people and bringing about 3.5 million overnight visitors a year, according to tourism officials. Early July brings two of its biggest annual events -- the Independence Day holiday and the following weekend's Pensacola Beach air show, which features the locally based Navy aerobatic team, the Blue Angels. Faced with those concerns, the locals are trying to harness the power of technology and social media to offset the threat. ""We're encouraging our visitors who are currently here to post their vacation pictures on Facebook, and a lot of them have done that just so that visitors can see with their own eyes the oil hasn't hit,"" Laura Lee said. And Buck Lee said the island authority hopes to put cameras on the beach and video streaming on the internet within about two weeks, ""so they can see for themselves whether there's oil on the beach or not."" ""And there may be,"" he said. ""But we've got to get them the facts.""","Tourism pumped about $1.2 billion into Pensacola, Florida-area economy last year .

155,"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Ronide Baduel keeps a broken teacup tucked away for safekeeping. One day, she will look at it, maybe even smile, and recall how life's rhythms shifted with the earth in January. She was unlike many of her Haitian compatriots who were barely squeaking by. She had everything: an education, a decent job as a nurse, a three-bedroom home she rented with her teenage son, who was in school. But when the massive earthquake struck, Baduel's house collapsed. For the first time in her life, she had nothing. She ran through the streets clutching the hand of her injured son, following the crowd to Champs de Mars, a large plaza near the heavily damaged presidential palace. She spent the first night sitting on a low concrete wall. In the morning light, she saw the panicked look in the faces of thousands of people and she thought the worst. ""Life was done,"" she said. ""There was going to be no tomorrow."" She was well-off. But a natural disaster had plunged her to the depths of poverty. Earthquakes are not discriminating. Nor are the makeshift camps that sprouted all over the capital. When CNN first met Baduel, just two weeks after the quake, she was sleeping on dirt, under a few sheets of plastic. She had managed to buy a black faux patent leather handbag in which she kept a few personal items: Shampoo. Soap. A change of clothes. And two wallet-size photos of herself and her son that she rescued from the rubble of her house. There was nothing else in her tent. ""It was as though I had gone to hell,"" she said. Baduel did not know how to live in squalor. It was not as though she had come from Cite Soleil, Port-au-Prince's biggest slum, where many people, even before the earthquake, slept under tarps or on the streets. ""It was harder for middle-class people like me,"" she said. ""It's more difficult for those who had something before. I spent my money on my house, and the rest I saved for the future."" Robbed of her privacy, she struggled to attain some kind of dignity. When the private hospital where she worked, the Clinique de la Sante, reopened, she made sure to bathe there in the morning and then again before leaving for the night. There, she did not have to wash in public. Days turned to weeks. Mornings, afternoons, nights -- they were all the same in the tent city. Nothing to do but endure. Baduel watched the people around her. They were survivors. They lived among flies and filth, but they fed their children and cleaned their tents. They made the most of what they had left: their lives. She understood then that there was a God. And that she, too, had to give thanks that she was not crushed in the rubble and that her son's injury was not life-threatening. She understood that life was not done. At the end of March, after more than two months in the tent city, Baduel moved to her sister's flat when it was deemed safe. There, Baduel began to feel halfway back to having a proper existence. She has the use of a kitchen, a bathroom. When the city's flickering electricity is on, she can even watch a bit of television. She sleeps in a netted tent set up behind a locked gate in the front yard. It zips up tightly. Inside are fresh white linens. In late April, when CNN caught up with her again, she could manage a smile, but anxiety still defined her face. She didn't know yet how she would regain her life. In Haiti, she says, there is no such thing as insurance. No one will pay her a cent for the estimated $20,000 loss in personal property. She understands why impoverished people in the camps do not want to leave. There, at least, they have access to food, water and basic goods distributed by aid agencies. The wealthy fled the country or are able to sustain themselves otherwise. But for those in the middle, the struggle is particularly hard, Baduel says. Last November, her ex-husband died unexpectedly. He used to help pay expenses for her son. To make matters worse, even private hospitals in Port-au-Prince are suffering because people are flocking to public ones for free service. Baduel's monthly income, about $600 before the quake because she worked two jobs, has dipped to about $87, and rents are sky-high because of the demand for housing. But she will never return to a tent and tarp encampment. ""Not me,"" she says with defiance. ""Never."" She despised every moment at Champs de Mars but appreciates the way the experience changed her perspective on life. ""I probably spent too much money on making myself and my surroundings beautiful,"" she says. She wants to say something else, but the words never leave her lips. She hates that her future is so uncertain. If nothing else, she will leave her job and the city in which she was raised and go to live with her father in the town of Jeremie in western Haiti. She has already sent her son to live with another sister in Fontamara, away from central Port-au-Prince. She also sent the broken teacup there. For now, she doesn't need to look at it. She doesn't need any reminders.","After the January Haiti quake, Ronide Baduel had nothing for the first time in her life .

156,"(CNN) -- In some ways, a catastrophe of this magnitude could not have happened in a worse place. Or at a worse time of year. We're hearing a lot about the economic dislocation of thousands of Gulf fishers and their families -- and rightly so. But the oil disaster is a much larger calamity than the Gulf itself. It's not just a regional disaster. It has hemispheric implications. The Gulf is a large region, but its natural importance is even more outsized, disproportionate to its area. The Gulf is the hourglass pinch-point for millions of migrating creatures that funnel into, breed in, migrate through and then fan out of it to populate an enormous area of the continents and coasts. Anything that affects living things inside the Gulf affects living things far outside it. Certain animals that normally inhabit the open Atlantic travel to the Gulf to breed. Two such species, both endangered, breed nowhere else. The world's most endangered sea turtle, the Kemp's ridley turtle, ranges throughout the west Atlantic as far north as New England. But it breeds only in the Gulf. Many are now heading there to lay their eggs on remote beaches. Turtles are showing up on beaches debilitated by oil. Oil kills sea turtles by both ingestion and direct toxicity, and by stressing and suppressing their immune systems. Adults are vulnerable, but hatchlings will have an even harder time. Atlantic bluefin tuna -- the most high-priced ocean fish in the world -- have declined by about 90 percent since the 1960s due to overfishing. Their west Atlantic population ranges the East Coast of the U.S. and Canada and far out to sea, but the Gulf of Mexico is the giant fish's only known breeding area. Spring is their breeding season. According to a web tool that puts the slick over your home region, the vast area of surface oil is now bigger than Massachusetts, Connecticut and Long Island combined. It overlaps the tracked movements of breeding bluefin tuna. Consequently, their eggs and larvae are presumably being bathed in a toxic soup of oil and dispersant. Dispersant, which is toxic by itself, also makes the petroleum more toxic. Instead of remaining concentrated at the surface, dispersed oil pollutes the entire water column. Instead of evaporating, the toxic components remain in the water. And because it's dissolved, it passes more easily across gills and into digestive systems. Planktonic animals become disoriented or die. Meanwhile, of course, mats of oil are washing ashore. No amount of boom will protect waterbirds like pelicans, gulls and terns, because diving into the water for fish is how they eat. In the Gulf in May, with the oil gushing, were loons, gannets, various kinds of herons and terns. Also there were black skimmers that had spent the winter there but would soon leave to migrate north and, depending on species, breed all along the coast from the southern states to as far north as the Maritimes, and lakes across much of Canada. Some of the longest-distance migrants on Earth are various sandpipers, plovers and other shorebirds, many of which winter as far south as Patagonia and breed as far north as the high arctic. Perhaps a million cross the Gulf in May, and when they reach the U.S. coastline, they must stop to rest and feed. Problems with habitat and food supply have reduced many of their populations 50 to 80 percent in the past 20 years. And now this. When oil was just starting to smudge some of the birds on beaches now thick with it, I saw sanderlings, ruddy turnstones, black-bellied plovers and other such northbound birds. Even among those that do not get heavily oiled, many will not make it. The birds' energy budgets operate on thin margins of food intake against exhaustive expenditure in long-distance flight. They will not bear the additional cost of feathers sticking and functioning inefficiently, and many such birds will drop out on their way north. Migrating peregrine falcons traveling north from South American wintering areas, destined for nesting areas as far as Greenland, are also crossing the Gulf's marshes. Preferentially picking off birds whose flight seems compromised, falcons will be getting disproportional doses of oil. All these birds can live decades and take years to mature, so adult birds killed by oil this year will mean populations reduced for years to come. This is a calamity not just in space but in time as well. Some animals may be rescued. Less possible to cleanse is the anguish on the faces and in the hearts of fishing families. Oil companies can drill, and they can buy votes in Congress, but apparently they can't do much else. Now that the reckoning is here, it becomes a little easier to see that we fool ourselves with the apparent cheapness of subsidized oil and that a healthy environment is priceless beyond reckoning. Why do we fail to know this always, in our bones? The Gulf is not a thing unto itself. Neither is the oil eruption. We are all Gulf victims now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carl Safina.","Gulf is huge area that is crucial for migrating species, says Carl Safina .

157,"(CNN) -- The latest prediction for the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season agrees with three previous ones, forecasting a season that will be at least a bit milder than last year's. Last year's most destructive hurricane, Ike, tossed boats onto the shore in Bayton, Texas, in September. AccuWeather is the most recent organization to release its outlook, predicting Wednesday that the season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, will bring 13 named storms and eight hurricanes. In 2008, there were 16 named storms and eight hurricanes, five of which were major -- that is, classified as Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale of storm intensity -- with winds of 111 mph or higher. The three previous forecasts were released in December by Colorado State University (14 named storms, seven hurricanes), WSI Corp. (13 named storms, seven hurricanes) and Weather Research Center (seven named storms, four hurricanes). Storms acquire a name when they are designated tropical storms, with sustained maximum winds of at least 39 mph. Though they foresee fewer storms than last year, all the forecasts except the one from the Weather Research Center would translate into an above-average season. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a ""normal"" Atlantic season has 11 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes. NOAA won't release its predictions until closer to the start of the season. And the forecasts already made are likely to be updated as June draws near. AccuWeather projected that four of the hurricanes in 2009 will hit the U.S. East Coast or Gulf Coast, and one of those will be a Category 3. Joe Bastardi, AccuWeather's chief long-range forecaster, wrote on the company's Web site that this year's ""storms may be more likely to form in the Atlantic Basin closer to the coast, and the possibility of a major hurricane making landfall in the U.S. cannot be ruled out."" WSI, on its Web site, said its predictions for 2009 stemmed from the expected continuation of ""warmer-than-normal Atlantic Ocean temperature anomalies into next summer and fall, and the likelihood of a favorable or neutral wind shear environment associated with the lack of an El Niño event."" El Niño is a fluctuation in the ocean-atmosphere system in the tropical Pacific that can impact global weather. Last year was considered the fourth busiest Atlantic hurricane year since 1944. The National Climatic Data Center said 2008 was ""the only year on record in which a major hurricane existed in every month from July through November in the north Atlantic."" The most destructive was Hurricane Ike, which wiped out neighborhoods in parts of Texas. Even a week later, its remnants were still having an impact on the Great Lakes region. Two other hurricanes made landfall in the United States last year -- Dolly and Gustav. Neither was a major hurricane at the time it came ashore.","AccuWeather forecast joins three others predicting milder hurricane season .

158,"(CNN) -- Valentino Rossi's hopes of retaining his MotoGP title were shattered on Saturday when the nine-time world champion motorcyclist suffered a horrific crash in a practice session for his home race in Italy. The 31-year-old could be out for months after fracturing a shin bone in his leg when he was thrown from his Yamaha in the second session ahead of qualifying at Mugello. He had an operation on Saturday afternoon, the official MotoGP Web site reported, after being flown to Careggi Hospital in Florence and then moved to the orthopedic trauma center. ""It's an injury more serious than we thought, because it's an exposed fracture with the bone protruding from the skin,"" Doctor Claudio Macchiagodena of the sport's traveling medics Clinica Mobile told motogp.com. ""We have reduced the fracture, which fortunately has not affected any blood vessels or nerves. It is serious."" Doctor Roberto Buzzi, who performed the operation, said Rossi would be ruled out for at least two months. The rider, known as ""The Doctor"" among other nicknames, could miss eight races, starting with Sunday's Italian Grand Prix -- which he has won nine times. ""The surgery had good results,"" Buzzi told motogp.com. ""The alignment was good and the bone is now stable. ""The wound remains open, as is usual in these cases, and it will be stitched in the next few days with another short surgery. We are confident that Valentino will be able to leave the hospital in a week to 10 days, able to put weight on the leg with the aid of crutches. ""It is difficult to say how long the post surgery rehabilitation will take. But I think that we can reasonably think of six weeks of partial weight-bearing with crutches, after which Valentino needs to be re-evaluated."" Rossi has not missed a race since his debut in the 125cc class in Malaysia in 1996, but his record run of 230 successive GP starts will now end. He is second overall in the world championship standings this season, nine points behind Jorge Lorenzo of Spain, who will start Sunday's race second on the grid behind compatriot Dani Pedrosa. Australia's former world champion Casey Stoner qualified third ahead of Ducati teammate Nicky Hayden, whose veteran fellow American Colin Edwards was fifth on a Monster Yamaha Tech 3. Pedrosa is fourth overall, 30 points behind Lorenzo, as he seeks his first win of 2010. Lorenzo is seeking his third successive victory in what is the fourth race of the season. ""I want to say how sad I am for Valentino. I know how bad it is to be injured, especially at your home race, and it looks very painful for him,"" the 23 year-old told motogp.com. ""I hope he recovers quickly because the championship will not be the same without him.""","MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi to have operation after fracturing his leg .

159,"(CNN) -- Tsunami warnings were canceled for all countries Sunday, a day after a deadly 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck Chile, forecasters said. However, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in its cancellation alert it was only advising governments, and ""only national and local government agencies have the authority to make decisions regarding the official state of alert in their area and any actions to be taken in response."" Despite the cancellation, Japan remained cautious. The nation's meteorological agency opted to downgrade the warning without eliminating it entirely. Its prior alert of ""major tsunami"" was changed to ""tsunami."" The quake struck Chile early Saturday, killing at least 300 people and prompting tsunami warnings and advisories along the Pacific. Chilean officials are expected to announce an updated death toll later Sunday. Full coverage of Chile quake . Japan experienced waves along its coast Sunday afternoon. It was the last nation a tsunami was expected to reach, according to the alert. No injuries were reported, but Japanese authorities advised tens of thousands of evacuees from coastal areas not to return home yet. The first tsunami -- a 4-inch wave -- hit the Pacific island of Minami Torishima, according to the Japanese meteorological agency. A few waves later, the tallest one yet at about 4 feet hit the Kuji Port in Iwate, the meteorological agency said. The northern part of the main island could be hit by a tsunami at least 9 feet high. Are you there? Share your photos, video with CNN . Sunday's alert was Japan's first major tsunami warning in more than 15 years, the agency reported. In 1960, a tsunami spawned by Chile's 1960 earthquake killed 140 people in Japan. In the U.S. state of Hawaii, the cancellation occurred nearly two hours after the first waves came ashore. Coast Guard crews said they had found no significant damage to ports or waterways as a result of the tsunami. But the tsunami center said some coastal areas may see small sea-level changes or unusual currents for the next few hours. The cancellation ""does not mean it is now safe to resume normal activities or re-enter evacuated shoreline areas,"" the tsunami center said. It said that county civil defense agencies and local police departments would make those determinations. ""There was no assessment of any damage in any county, which is quite remarkable,"" said Gov. Linda Lingle. ""It's just a wonderful day that nothing happened and no one was hurt or injured."" Check out the world's biggest earthquakes since 1900 . In Chile, tsunami waves came ashore along the coast shortly after the earthquake, U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist Victor Sardina said. The largest was 9 feet near the quake's epicenter, Sardina said. On the island of Juan Fernandez -- 400 miles (643 km) off Chile's coast -- a large wave killed six people, Provincial Governor Ivan De La Maza said. At least 11 people are missing. Navigational buoys in Ventura County, California, got minor damage as a result of a 2-foot surge and waves, according to the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center.

160,"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- On day 46 of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, BP began to siphon oil from the ruptured undersea well to the surface, where it was flowing onto the awaiting drill ship Discover Enterprise. As the recovery process started Friday, BP said it would shut four vents on top of a containment cap from which oil was still escaping into the ocean. The company hoped that closing the vents would greatly reduce the amount of gushing crude, though there was still enormous uncertainty about the ultimate success of BP's latest effort to contain and recover the oil. U.S. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the federal government's response manager, said estimates of how much oil is being captured or whether any leaks develop will be determined later Friday. President Obama, who said he was ""furious at this entire situation,"" arrived in Louisiana on Friday afternoon to get another firsthand look at the environmental damage and speak with political and business leaders. Obama did not provide details about attempts to seal the well, but said ""it does appear that the cap -- at least for now -- is holding."" He quickly added, however, that it is ""way too early to be optimistic."" Officials should know more about the success or failure of the effort in next 24 to 48 hours, he said. Researchers at the University of South Florida have completed laboratory tests confirming that the oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico has collected into more than one oil plume beneath the surface. The plumes are as wide as 6 miles, though their lengths are unclear, researchers said. In the past, BP has denied that such large amounts of oil, which can choke fish and harm their eggs, have formed into underwater plumes. However, on Tuesday, BP Managing Director Bob Dudley said, ""The science of the plumes hanging in the water doesn't feel right. What happens is dispersant breaks the drops down into small drops and they move around and break down."" Last month, Dudley told NPR that the plumes likely would not remain. ""Oil by nature, in its own specific gravity, isn't going to stay in a plume like that,"" he said. ""It should rise to the surface, and then we'll be able to attack the spill in that way."" The university, which recently discovered a second oil plume in the Gulf, concluded that microscopic oil droplets are forming deepwater oil plumes. ""These hydrocarbons are from depth and not associated with sinking, degraded oil, but associated with the source of the Deep Horizon well head,"" said David Hollander, a professor of chemical oceanography at USF. On Thursday, Allen acknowledged ""some anecdotal reports from research vessels from universities that have found dense plumes or what they believe to be plumes under the water."" ""We're in the process of taking samples and trying to figure out what they are,"" he said. ""They're denser than the water, but we're not sure whether it's oil or not."" The cost of the federal response effort to the spill totaled $93 million as of June 1, according to a Friday letter from Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and Allen to congressional leadership. They are requesting Congress approve a proposed provision that would make available up to an additional $100 million to the Coast Guard. The Obama administration has also sent a $69 million bill to BP for the government's efforts to help deal with the spill. The bill accounts for 75 percent of what BP owes to date, and the company has until July 1 to pay the full amount, an administration official said. Oil that has already affected Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama is drifting steadily toward Florida. A new trajectory from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued Friday forecast oil onshore as far east as Destin, Florida, by Saturday afternoon. Tar balls, tar patties and sheen were confirmed 10 miles from the Escambia County shoreline, and the primary oil plume, according to NOAA, was 30 miles from Pensacola, Florida. Escambia County Commission Chairman Grover Robinson, whose district covers Pensacola, said he found tar balls the size of silver dollars and smaller while walking on the beach Friday morning. He added that BP didn't send cleanup crews until hours later in the afternoon. However, he said there was nothing unusual about the water, and that the beach remained open to tourists. ""You can't help but be passionate about Florida,"" Gov. Charlie Crist said Friday about the state's natural beauty and the importance of tourism. What was needed now, he said, was strong leadership to get through the crisis. ""You've got to keep a cool head in order to win a hot game,"" he said. BP remained optimistic but again warned that the containment cap had been positioned on a ruptured well head a mile below the ocean's surface. In a statement, the British oil giant said that the system's ability to contain oil or its continued operation ""cannot be assured."" On Thursday night, BP completed a complex underwater maneuver. After mixed success with cutting off a damaged pipe, BP positioned a cap over the ruptured well head, though the company was uncertain whether the cap's seal would be snug enough to prevent oil from leaking out. Even so, Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer, was hopeful. ""I think it should work,"" he said. Undersea images Friday showed a great deal of oil still spewing from the well. Allen said the vents in the cap were designed to let oil escape to prevent cold water from entering and forming icy hydrates that could block the flow to the surface. Only when the vents are closed will BP be able to determine whether the seal on the cap is snug enough to keep massive amounts of oil from gushing into the ocean. BP's progress was received with tempered applause. ""The placement of the containment cap is another positive development in BP's most recent attempt to contain the leak. However, it will be some time before we can confirm that this method will work,"" said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Tony Russell. ""Even if successful, this is only a temporary and partial fix, and we must continue our aggressive response."" The well may not be completely sealed off until at least until August, when BP hopes to finish drilling two relief wells. ""Our task is to contain the oil, ultimately to eliminate the leaking well and, most importantly, to clean up the oil, defend the shoreline and restore the shoreline where the oil comes ashore, so we return it to the original state,"" said Tony Hayward, BP's chief executive officer. Hayward appears this week in television ads launched as part of a national campaign to restore the British oil company's tarnished reputation. In them, Hayward apologizes and promises to ""make this right."" However, state and local leaders said they are fed up with the way BP has approached the response. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said he told Obama Friday that ""BP still hasn't given the state a dime"" to pay for its efforts in cleanup. ""We are moving forward with or without BP."" He also blasted the company for not quickly compensating those who are out of work because of the spill. ""Our people deserve to be fully compensated for their losses,"" Jindal said. ""Instead of BP shelling out $50 million on an ad campaign that promises to do good work in responding to this spill, BP should just focus on actually doing a good job and spend the $50 million on assistance to our people, our industries and our communities that are suffering as a result of this ongoing spill."" A BP spokesman wouldn't put a price on the ad campaign, but said ""not a cent is being diverted from the oil spill response."" Protests against the oil company that sprouted this week are set to continue in several cities through the weekend. And anger continued to fester in coastal communities. Hayward said Friday that the company will establish a separate division to manage its response to the crisis. BP has said that it has spent $1 billion so far but that it was too early to predict the ultimate financial blow. ""We've got considerable firepower to deal with the costs,"" said Chief Financial Officer Byron Grote, referring to $5 billion in available cash, $5 billion in bank credit lines and an additional $5 billion in standby credit facilities. The BP well erupted after an explosion and fire on the leased Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20 that killed 11 people. The rig sank two days later, leaving up to 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of oil pouring into the Gulf daily, according to federal estimates. BP, rig owner Transocean and oilfield services contractor Halliburton have all pointed fingers at one another for the disaster. A crew of scientists who just returned from an eight-day mission researching the underwater oil impact of the spill has found life forms near the breached well head, officials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Friday. The researchers aboard the 224-foot Gordon Gunter found ""ample evidence of a lot of zooplankton,"" said NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco. ""It's not a dead zone. There's still a lot of life there."" Zooplankton are organisms that drift through bodies of water, and many of them are not visible to the naked eye. The question, she said, is how much of an impact the oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster will ultimately have. The researchers took underwater samples from within 3 nautical miles (3.45 miles) of the well head. The scientist are trying to determine how much oil is out there, in what concentrations and where it came from, Lubchenco said, adding that they ""can't assume all the oil that is out there is from the Deepwater Horizon -- some of it may be from other sources.""","Researchers confirm existence of oil plumes beneath the surface .

161,"Pensacola, Florida (CNN) -- As oil drifted onto beaches as far east as the Florida Panhandle, a BP official said Saturday the company was pleased with its operation to funnel crude up from the ruptured undersea well to a drilling ship a mile above on the Gulf of Mexico. BP Senior Vice President Bob Fryar said the company funneled about 250,000 gallons of oil in the first 24 hours from a containment cap installed on the well to a drilling ship on the ocean surface. ""That operation has gone extremely well,"" Fryar said at an Alabama news conference. ""We are very pleased."" That's about 31 percent of the 798,000 gallons of crude federal authorities estimate is gushing into the sea every day. The company's progress was not enough to temper the frustration seething among residents along the coastline. Tony Kennon, the mayor of Orange Beach, Alabama, confronted Fryar at the afternoon news conference for not acting promptly when reports of tar balls washing ashore surfaced. Visibly upset, Kennon said local officials have been asking to meet with BP officials for over a month, but their requests went unanswered. ""If you sensed our frustration, you would have been here a lot sooner,"" Kennon told Fryar. ""People in Orange Beach are starving to death now because they can't get out to catch the fish."" BP engineers are hoping to increase the amount being funneled to the drilling ship but have to be careful about the pressure within the cap that was placed on the well head a few days ago, said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the federal government's response manager. Allen told reporters at a briefing Saturday that BP plans to shut valves in the cap -- which are allowing oil to escape -- once the pressure is eased. The ultimate capacity of the operation is 630,000 captured gallons a day, still shy of the amount spewing. Earlier, coastal residents had anxiously awaited news of BP's progress as elevated southerly winds pushed the perimeter of the spilled oil to shorelines as far east as the Florida Panhandle. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that scattered tar balls and light sheen would impact beaches as far east as Bay County, home to popular destinations in Panama City. Florida beaches remained open Saturday but the number of beachgoers was down. Sun and surf were interrupted by sticky brown globs of oil washing up on the sugary sand and workers with blue rubber gloves and plastic bags trying to keep the beach clean. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist walked the beach accompanied by ""Margaritaville"" singer Jimmy Buffet, who is building a hotel on the Pensacola shoreline. ""I saw some tar balls,"" Crist said. ""It's terrible when you see something like that. It breaks your heart."" Florida Sen. George LeMieux, a Republican, demanded that BP donate $1 billion for a cleanup fund for the five Gulf states and said that President Obama ""needs to push them to do that."" ""I want to see this president more engaged here on the ground, working through problems,"" LeMieux said. The oil slick has already threatened ecologically sensitive lands along the Gulf Coast. Images of oil-drenched pelicans were all over the internet, prompting even more public anger toward BP. Obama sought in his weekly address Saturday to ease fear along the Gulf Coast by reaffirming his commitment to clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history. ""It's brutally unfair. It's wrong,"" Obama said in the address, recorded a day earlier in Grand Isle, Louisiana. ""And what I told these men and women -- and what I have said since the beginning of this disaster -- is that I'm going to stand with the people of the Gulf Coast until they are made whole."" It appeared that BP was making progress after capping the breached well head, Obama said, but he said the federal government was ""prepared for the worst."" He cited a series of statistics that illuminated the ""largest response to an environmental disaster of this kind in the history of our country."" They are as follows: . • 17,500 National Guard troops authorized for deployment. • 20,000 people currently working to protect water and coastlines. • 1,900 vessels are in the Gulf assisting in the cleanup. • 4.3 million feet of boom deployed with another 2.9 million feet of boom available, enough to stretch 1,300 miles. • 17 staging areas across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to rapidly defend sensitive shorelines. Meanwhile, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Saturday reopened an area of the Gulf to fishing. After reviewing images and data, the agency reopened more than 13,000 square miles west of the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. At the same time, it closed 2,275-square miles off the Florida Panhandle, extending the northern boundary just east of the western edge of Choctawhatchee Bay. That means that 32 percent of the Gulf still remains off-limits for fishing. The BP well erupted after an explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20. Eleven people on board died and the BP-leased rig sank two days later, leaving up to 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of oil pouring into the Gulf daily, according to federal estimates. BP has struggled to contain the gushing oil, trying myriad methods to plug the well and divert the crude. Thursday was the first time the British oil giant was able to report progress, when it successfully lowered a containment cap on the ruptured well. Even if the funneling procedure is able to contain most of the oil, the solution is temporary, Allen said. The gushing well can only be killed after BP completes drilling of two relief wells. Allen said the first relief well is about 7,000 feet below the ocean floor. BP will have to go down to between 16,000 and 18,000 feet to be able to intercept the breached well. The long-term threat, Allen said, will not go away until a relief well is completed. BP has said the earliest that will be done is August.","NEW: BP official ""pleased"" with containment progress .

162,"(CNN) -- A tsunami warning was canceled Friday for Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean when the threat from a 7.2-magnitude earthquake had passed. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued the warning early Friday when the quake struck near the island of Vanuatu, saying that an earthquake of that size ""has the potential to generate a destructive tsunami that can strike coastlines in the region near the epicenter within minutes to hours."" There were no reports of serious damage or injuries. The earthquake was 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) deep, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Its epicenter was 215 kilometers (135 miles) from Luganville, Vanuatu. It struck at 4:14 a.m. Friday (1:14 p.m. Thursday ET), the USGS said. The USGS initially classified the quake as a 7.6 -magnitude, but later downgraded it.","Warning canceled for Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and New Caledonia .

163,"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Investigators were searching for bodies in a mangled wreck Saturday, a day after two trains crashed and killed at least 98 people in eastern India, officials said. Maoist rebels are suspected of causing the crash by removing the fasteners securing the tracks, police said. Authorities identified some suspects, but had not yet made any arrests, said Bhupinder Singh, police chief in West Bengal state. He said ""quite a few"" people were involved. At least 115 passengers were injured when 13 cars of the Mumbai-bound Lokmanya Tilak Gyaneshwari Express derailed, capsized on a parallel track and were slammed by a cargo train, authorities said. More than a dozen bodies may still be trapped inside the wreckage, said N.S. Nigam, West Midnapore district magistrate. Singh told reporters Friday that officers had found Maoist posters claiming responsibility for the attack. ""It appears to be a case of sabotage where a portion of the railway track was removed. Whether explosives were used is not yet clear,"" Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram said in a statement Friday. Manoj Verma, the district police superintendent, said Friday that investigators were looking into the possibility that ""fishplates,"" which secure rail joints, were missing from the track. The role of Maoists ""cannot be ruled out,"" Verma said. India regards Maoists as its gravest internal security threat. More than 70 officers were killed in a suspected Maoist ambush in Chhattisgarh state last month in what was seen as one of the most daring attacks by the left-wing guerrillas on Indian security forces. The insurgents, on the other hand, have claimed since the 1960s to be fighting for the dispossessed. In February, Chidambaram said that more than 900 people, including almost 600 civilians, were killed in Maoist-related incidents in 2009. About 200 suspected rebels were also slain as forces moved into areas under insurgent control, he said.","At least 98 people killed after passenger train jumps track and slams into freight train .

164,"(CNN) -- Oil spill cleanup is under way at many beaches along the Gulf Coast, and beach-bound travelers are keeping a close eye on coastal conditions. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil spill: . Grand Isle, Louisiana . Oil is affecting more than 45 miles of Louisiana coast, according to a state emergency website. The site includes a roundup of oil sightings along the coast, including this report Monday from Grand Isle: ""Oil sheen filled with 10 foot wide tar balls extending from 50 yards off of the southwest tip of Grand Isle south into the gulf."" iReporter Natasha Combs visited Grand Isle on Sunday to observe cleanup efforts. ""The beach was empty with the exception of the workers and the military. All of the cleanup crew were wearing HAZMAT suits. Bags of oil were gathered in piles along the beach, and workers were rinsing oil off of themselves in small plastic kid pools,"" Combs said. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites are open, according to the National Park Service website. The park service reports that crews found ""very light occurrences of oil"" on Horn and Petit Bois islands in Mississippi. Petit Bois island was cleaned up and has been free of oil as of Sunday, the site said. The Mississippi State Department of Health urges people to avoid swimming or boating in ""any waters visibly affected by oil."" The spill also has affected parts of the Gulf Islands National Seashore in Florida. Cleanup crews have been working on medium and heavier oil coverage at Perdido Key, Fort Pickens and Santa Rosa. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . In Alabama, the Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan. The beaches remain open. The pier at Gulf State Park in Gulf Shores is closed to fishing but open for sightseeing, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. State Gulf waters and some inshore waters have been closed to fishing by the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Pensacola and Perdido Key, Florida . The waters in Pensacola and Perdido Key are open Tuesday for swimming and fishing, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Officials have not issued closures or health advisories for the area, the bureau's website said. iReporter Mike McHugh shot video over the weekend at Johnson's Beach on Perdido Key. ""I came back to Johnson's Beach to see how the cleanup was progressing and to see what high tide brought in. At 4:30 p.m., the cleanup crews were gone. There were less tar balls, but still [they] are easy to find,"" he  wrote. iReporter James Amerson has been tracking the oil in Pensacola, Florida. Tar balls were found late last week on Pensacola Beach, ranging in size from 2 to 3 inches up to 18 inches, Amerson said. ""Strange to think this stuff, millions of years old, came from several thousand feet underground and floated over a 100 miles until it came to rest our sugar white sands,"" Amerson wrote on iReport.com. The visitors bureau urges beachgoers to take precautions.

165,"(CNN) -- A killer whale at SeaWorld Orlando died Sunday while giving birth, the theme park said. The calf was stillborn. The father of the calf was Tilikum -- the killer whale involved in death of a trainer in February. SeaWorld canceled two shows on Sunday, but all shows were expected to resume Monday. ""We are very saddened by this loss,"" said Chris Dold, vice president of veterinary services for SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment.  ""Although we understand that complications with pregnancy can occur here, just as they do in the wild, the loss of any animal affects all of us at SeaWorld."" Taima, a 20-year-old killer whale, died from complications associated with the birthing process, SeaWorld said. Taima had successfully given birth to three calves previously. ""Preliminary indications suggest that her death was caused by a condition in which the placenta is delivered before the fetus, as well as an unusual position of the fetus in the birthing canal,"" SeaWorld said.  ""She was not able to deliver the stillborn fetus naturally; SeaWorld's veterinarians attempted to assist, but her complications were too severe."" SeaWorld has had 26 successful births of killer whale calves in captivity, according to Dold, who said the birthing success rate is about 50 percent in the wild and 85 percent in a ""zoological situation."" A necropsy has been scheduled to determine the cause of death.","Killer whale at SeaWorld Orlando dies giving birth .

166,"(CNN) -- Seven people were electrocuted during heavy storms that hit the port city of Karachi after Cyclone Phet battered parts of southern Pakistan on Sunday, a provincial health chief told CNN. Phet lashed Pakistan's southwestern coast early Sunday as it approached landfall. The Pakistani navy dispatched helicopters throughout the weekend to alert fishermen near Karachi and parts of Balochistan of the cyclone. About 1,000 people were rescued from Gwadar by Pakistani authorities and taken to a navy shelter on Saturday. Dr. Sagheer Ahmed, health minister of Sindh province, had no other details on the electrocutions. Also Saturday, officials safely brought 24 fishing boats and 129 fishermen back to shore, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported. The navy remained on high alert Sunday, should they be needed in the aftermath of the cyclone. Civilians along Pakistan's coast will receive priority in the relief effort, dubbed ""Operation Madad,"" said Pakistani Chief of Naval Staff Adm. Nauman Bashir. On Friday, Phet dumped up to 25 centimeters (10 inches) of rain on coastal Oman. It brought massive flooding to Muscat and whipped the capital with winds gusting above 200 kph (125 mph) at the height of the storm.","NEW: 7 electrocuted during heavy storms in Karachi, Pakistan .

168,"London, England (CNN) -- Two nine-month-old twin girls were in a serious condition in hospital on Monday after being mauled by a fox as they slept in their London home, according to police. The two girls were attacked in their upstairs bedroom at a house in Hackney, east London, after the fox apparently entered the house through a door left open because of the heat while the twins' parents watched television downstairs, police said. ""Officers and the London Ambulance Service attended and found two nine-month-old girls with injuries,"" a Metropolitan Police spokesman told CNN. ""Both babies were taken to an east London hospital where their condition is described as serious but stable."" A fox caught in a trap placed at the rear of the property by local environmental officers was destroyed early on Monday, the spokesman said. ""On Sunday night a neighbor informed environmental health officers that an animal could be heard in one of the traps,"" he said. ""A vet was called to establish if it was safe to move the animal. It was determined it was not and the fox was humanely killed by the pest controller... The traps will remain in situ for the time being."" The twins, Lola and Isabella Koupparis, are being treated at London's Royal Free Hospital. The twins' four-year-old brother, who was also asleep upstairs, was not hurt, the UK's Press Association said. The girls' mother, Pauline Koupparis, told the BBC she had gone to check on the twins after hearing ""a funny cry, not a normal cry"" from the bedroom. ""It was quite muffled but very pained. I went into the room and I saw some blood in Isabella's cot, I thought she had a nosebleed. ""I put on the light, I saw the fox, it just looked at me and it wasn't even scared of me. I started screaming as I realised Lola was also covered in blood."" Foxes are a common sight throughout London, especially in Hackney which backs onto the green spaces of Hackney Marshes, the Lea Valley Regional Park and the new Olympic site. A neighbor of the family told PA: ""We've all got foxes at the bottom of our gardens. Some people have got two or three living in their garden. They're all as bold as brass. You walk out into the garden and you have to shoo them away."" Of the twin girls, she said: ""They're beautiful little babies, really beautiful."" Michael Parra, another neighbor, said police had warned residents not to leave doors open in the summer weather. ""We see a lot of foxes around here. They're always in our garden. Something should be done about them. I would love to get them out of here. They're really a nuisance and a danger. They've terrorized our garden."" A Hackney Council spokesman said the council didn't have dedicated environmental officers to deal with foxes but had called in a private contractor over the incident. He said the council usually received ""one or two phone calls a month"" from people concerned about foxes going through their trash. ""We have never had reports in the past of foxes attacking residents,"" the spokesman told CNN. ""All the expert advice we have had suggests that shocking incidents like this are incredibly rare, and our thoughts are with the children and their family.""","Twin girls were asleep in upstairs bedroom when attack occured .

169,"(CNN) -- The crew of the drill rig Deepwater Horizon may have been overworked and short of key personnel before the explosion that unleashed the worst oil spill in U.S. history, a leading Democratic congressman suggested Tuesday. Payroll records show that 20 crewmen -- including seven of the 11 who died on the rig -- had worked a 24-hour shift six days before the explosion, Rep. Nick Rahall wrote in a letter to Steven Newman, CEO of rig owner Transocean Ltd. Rig workers typically work 12-hour days. And records showed only 18 people at work on the second shift on April 20, the night of the explosion, ""with zero engineers, electricians, mechanics or subsea supervisors listed in the report,"" he added. ""Although these reports do not provide a complete picture of who exactly was working during the time of the explosion and in the days leading up to it, when combined with the ongoing BP internal investigation that suggests that inattentiveness may have been a contributing factor in the disaster, I have serious questions about whether enough people were working on the night of April 20 to adequately handle the complex operations that were being performed, or if crew fatigue caused by extended shifts may have played a role,"" wrote Rahall, D-West Virginia, the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. Rahall called on the company to give his committee more detailed logs and a further explanation of its staffing -- a request Transocean said it would meet. But Transocean said no worker put in a 24-hour day, and the documents Rahall cited didn't tell the whole picture. Daily drilling reports track operations and ""certain personnel,"" it said, ""but does not use them to catalog complete crew shifts or the actual hours worked by each crewmember."" ""At the time of the accident, the Deepwater Horizon and its crew had compiled seven consecutive years of operations without a single lost-time safety incident,"" the company said in a written statement. ""The vessel was properly and professionally manned; there was no shortage of technical expertise, nor did any crewmember work a 24-hour shift."" CNN was given access to individual time sheets that appear to back up Transocean's claim that no employees worked 24-hour shifts on April 14 -- six days before the explosion that eventually sank the rig. And other documents reviewed by CNN seem to indicate that additional salaried workers may have been on the job that don't show up on time sheets, possibly refuting the committee's claim the rig was shortstaffed on April 20. Transocean, well owner BP and oilfield services contractor Halliburton have blamed each other for the disaster that followed the explosion. The undersea well the rig was drilling has been gushing up to 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of crude a day into the Gulf of Mexico since late April. Rahall's committee is one of several in both houses of Congress to hold hearings into the spill, which now dwarfs 1989's Exxon Valdez disaster. In addition, a presidential commission and a Coast Guard-Interior Department board in Louisiana are investigating. BP reported problems controlling the well and won a delay in testing a critical piece of equipment in March, according to documents released in late May. Stephen Stone, a laborer on the doomed rig, told the House Judiciary Committee that drilling had to stop four times in three weeks because of the loss of drilling fluid, ""either because the underground formation was unstable or because drilling too quickly caused the formation to crack."" The well was five weeks behind schedule, and some of the survivors have told CNN that BP cut corners and pushed ahead with the well despite safety concerns. In addition, Doug Brown, the rig's chief mechanic, told the Judiciary Committee that BP and Transocean managers argued over drill plans the day of the explosion and that cuts to Deepwater Horizon's engineering staff left the crew with a backlog of preventive maintenance to perform.","New:  Transocean documents appear to refute lawmaker's claims .

170,"Buras, Louisiana (CNN) -- The sign out front points the way: birds, please enter to the right; humans, enter on the left. Huddled in a pen and covered in brown streaks of oil, a dozen pelicans await treatment after exposure to the pools of crude on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. Increasing numbers of birds are arriving at the Fort Jackson Oiled Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in this coastal Louisiana town as the environmental disaster in the Gulf stretches on. At least 50 birds were treated on Tuesday alone. Wildlife workers say the birds get oiled when diving for fish. Their efforts at preening sometimes worsen the coating of crude on their feathers. The lucky ones are found by state workers and volunteers in time to save their lives. ""The animals that are coming in are covered in oil,"" the center's Rebecca Dunne says. ""But they are pretty healthy animals. So that makes us feel like like we have a chance to save them. We have been pretty successful so far."" While around 200 birds have been dead on arrival at the center, so far none of the 400 birds brought in alive have died. But not all of them express their gratitude. ""If you let 'em loose, they'll bite ya,"" says one volunteer holding shut the bill of a brown bird tucked under his arm. New arrivals get a physical, and a day to ""de-stress."" Next, it's time for a scrubbing. They're washed with Dawn soap, rinsed and dried. Finally, it's out to the aviary pens out back -- labeled ""pelican island"" -- where they are kept for observation and recovery. On Tuesday, top football stars from the Super Bowl-winning New Orleans Saints came out to thank the center's volunteers. ""It's all about doing whatever we can down here in south Louisiana and the Gulf Coast, to help these people come back,"" quarterback Drew Brees told CNN's John King. After rehab, the birds are scheduled for release in Florida, where they are less likely to repeat their run-in with the spilled oil. But not all birds are so lucky. ""For every bird they rescue, there are other birds that are oiled, but that they couldn't rescue,"" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal says. ""That is what is so heartbreaking to the people of Louisiana."" The latest Consolidated Fish and Wildlife Collection report says 380 oiled birds and 50 sea turtles have been rescued; 594 birds and 250 sea turtles have been found dead. For better or for worse, more birds are being found and brought in each day. Workers are planning to build eight more receiving pens in the coming days to handle the increasing influx of winged guests.

171,"(CNN) -- A woman in California delivered what may be the nation's second live-born set of octuplets on Monday morning, surprising doctors who expected seven babies. The first three to seven days will be critical for the infants, Dr. Mandhir Gupta said. The six boys and two girls -- ranging in weight from 1 pound 8 ounces to 3 pounds 4 ounces -- were generally doing well in incubators following their Caesarean-section delivery at Kaiser Permanente hospital in Bellflower, California, doctors said. Three of the babies need breathing assistance, but otherwise the eight don't appear to have serious problems, doctors said at a news conference Monday evening. ""It was a truly amazing delivery,"" said Dr. Karen Maples, chief of the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department. Doctors initially believed the mother -- whom they did not identify -- was pregnant with seven fetuses. The woman was 23 weeks pregnant when she was hospitalized seven weeks ago and ordered to bed rest.  Watch doctors explain what happened » . Over a seven-week period, a team of 46 physicians, nurses and other staff prepared for the births. When they started the delivery Monday -- more than nine weeks before the babies would be full term -- they were in for a surprise. ""After we got to Baby G, we were surprised by the discovery of a Baby H,"" Maples said. Getting the number correct with ultrasounds before delivery is difficult with so many babies, said Dr. Harold Henry, the hospital's chief of fetal medicine. ""It is quite easy to miss a baby when you're expecting seven,"" Henry said. The hospital said the woman didn't want her personal information released to the news media, and it would not answer questions about whether she'd had  fertility treatments. Preliminary research indicates this is the second set of live-born octuplets in the United States, according to the hospital. Eight babies believed to be the United States' first set of live octuplets were born in Houston, Texas, in 1998. One of the infants died days after birth. The seven other siblings recently celebrated their 10th birthday, the Houston Chronicle reported last month. The first three to seven days will be critical for the California babies, said Dr. Mandhir Gupta, one of the doctors at the news conference. The infants could be in incubators for six to eight weeks and in the hospital for 10 weeks, Gupta said. The mother is doing ""very well"" after the deliveries, which took about five minutes, Gupta said. ""She is very excited that she [has] all these babies and that the babies are looking good so far,"" Gupta said.","Babies may be U.S.'s second set of live-born octuplets, California hospital says .

172,"(CNN) -- Looking for love, or perhaps just for some cafeteria food or spelling lessons, an alligator was found Monday inside a middle school in suburban Tampa, Florida. Tampa Police were notified around 7 a.m. that the gator had set itself down in a prime spot, ""in front of the cafeteria"" in Stewart Middle School, the department said in a written statement. Although school does not let out for another week, no children were inside the school when the reptile was discovered, said Hillsborough County School District spokesman Steve Hegarty. The school is near the Hillsborough River, so it's not too far-fetched to think an alligator might make its way inside, Hegarty said. Still, he doesn't recall any similar incidents. ""The gator was contained in one of the hallways,"" police said. Trappers from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission caught the creature. No one was injured. It's currently alligator mating season. According to the conservation commission's website, alligator ""courtship"" begins in early April, with mating occurring in May or June.","Alligator was trapped inside school by wildlife experts .

173,"(CNN) -- Police were searching for a wildlife medical dart off the coast of New York on Friday after an unsuccessful attempt to euthanize a beached baby humpback whale Thursday night, according to East Hampton Village Police Chief Jerry Larsen. The dart bounced off the whale and ricocheted into the Atlantic Ocean. Larsen said Friday afternoon that the dart is encased in stainless steel but that it could pose a serious danger to swimmers in the months ahead. ""We're sending divers ... to retrieve the needle as soon as the surf dies down,"" Larsen said. Police also closed the area of beach, saying the dart might wash ashore. The whale was found on Main Beach in East Hampton on Tuesday and was deemed too sick to save, according to Charles Bowman, president of the Long Island-based Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation. ""The whale was debilitated,"" Bowman said. ""It was a thin and a young juvenile still dependent on its mother and couldn't survive on its own."" By Friday, the whale was unable to free itself from the beach, and Bowman's foundation advised the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that it was appropriate to euthanize the whale. ""It's heartbreaking for us. We're used to saving animals, getting them back in the ocean,"" Bowman said. ""It's just one of these situations that there's just no chance for it, [and we are] trying to get people to recognize that."" A NOAA official shot and killed the whale Friday morning.","Baby humpback was beached near East Hampton Village, New York .

Destin Mayor Sarah ""Sam"" Seevers told CNN a few, small tar balls came ashore this week but added that spotting occasional tar balls on the beach there is not unusual. ""We may go five years and not see any tar balls, and then we'll see a few. That's just a way of life on the Gulf of Mexico, Seevers said. The water at Pensacola Beach is open for swimming and fishing, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Gulf Islands National Seashore .

175,"(CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela will not attend Friday's opening of the World Cup soccer tournament after the death of his great-grandchild in a car crash, a representative said. ""It would therefore be inappropriate for him to personally attend the FIFA World Cup opening celebrations,"" said Sello Hatang, from the Mandela Foundation. ""We are sure that South Africans and people all over the world will stand in solidarity with Mr. Mandela and his family in the aftermath of this tragedy."" Zenani Mandela, 13, died early Friday morning while returning from the World Cup soccer tournament's kick-off concert, the foundation said. She was in a car returning from the show at Orlando Stadium when the wreck occurred. No other vehicle was involved in the wreck, the foundation said. The driver was arrested for culpable homicide and drunk driving, police told CNN. Zenani turned 13 on Wednesday. She was one of Mandela's nine great-grandchildren. The former leader had been expected to attend Friday's World Cup kickoff, his grandson Nkosi Mandela confirmed on Tuesday. Mandela, who is 91, played a key role in bringing the World Cup to South Africa but has made limited public appearances recently, although he did meet the South Africa squad last week.","Mandela played key role in bringing World Cup to South Africa .

176,"(CNN) -- The Mexican government is requesting a quick and transparent investigation into the fatal shooting by a U.S. Border Patrol agent of a Mexican teen in Ciudad Juarez on Monday night, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. The teen was shot during a rock-throwing incident, Mexican and U.S. officials said. Mexico ""reiterates that the use of firearms to repel a rock attack represents a disproportionate use of force, particularly coming from authorities who receive specialized training on the matter,"" the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday in a news release. The teen's death was the second at the hands of U.S. border authorities in less than two weeks. Monday night's incident started around 6:30 p.m. when Customs and Border Protection Border Patrol agents responded to a report of a group of suspected illegal immigrants being smuggled into the United States near the Paso del Norte port of entry, FBI Special Agent Andrea Simmons said. A suspect identified as Oscar Ivan Pineda Ayala was initially detained on the Rio Grande levee, said the FBI, which is leading the investigation. ""Another agent arrived on his bicycle along the cement apron that forms the riverbank on the U.S. side,"" Simmons said in a release. ""That agent detained a second subject, Augustin Alcaraz Reyes, but other subjects ran into Mexico and began to throw rocks at the agent. ""This agent, who had the second subject detained on the ground, gave verbal commands to the remaining subjects to stop and retreat,"" Simmons said. ""However, the subjects surrounded the agent and continued to throw rocks at him. The agent then fired his service weapon several times, striking one subject who later died."" Simmons told CNN earlier that she did not know whether the person who was shot was on the Mexican or U.S. side of the border, but that the agent never left U.S. territory. The body was found on the Mexican side of the border, Simmons said. The attorney general's office in Chihuahua identified the dead 14-year-old boy as secondary student Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca. Belmonte said Hernandez had been shot in the head. ""The young man was not armed,"" Ciudad Juarez spokesman Sergio Belmonte said. ""He did not have the physical size to threaten anyone. The aggression (by the U.S. agent) is evident."" The shooting occurred underneath the Black Bridge, a railroad span that connects the two countries, the Mexican official said. The FBI said the ""area where this incident occurred is a known high-risk crime area where rocks are regularly thrown at Border Patrol agents and where other assaults have been reported."" The FBI, which has jurisdiction in any assault on a federal officer, is leading the U.S. investigation with assistance from the  El Paso Police Department, the Border Patrol and other federal agencies, Simmons said. The shooting comes less than two weeks after the May 31 death of a Mexican illegal immigrant who had been detained three days earlier by border agents in California. San Diego police, who are investigating the death of Anastasio Hernandez, said he was beaten with a baton and shot with a stun gun after he became combative. California medical officials ruled his death a homicide. The investigation in that case continues. Mexican officials complained Tuesday that they see an increasing trend. ""The growing frequency of this type of event reflects a worrisome increment in the use of excessive force on the part of some border authorities,"" the Foreign Ministry said. According to the ministry, the number of Mexicans who have been killed or wounded by U.S. border authorities has increased from five in 2008 to 12 in 2009 and 17 so far this year. Mark Qualia, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said he could not comment because he does not know where the Mexican government obtained its statistics. But Qualia said there were 799 assaults on border agents from October 1, 2009, through May 31, up from 745 assaults for the same time period in 2007-08 and 658 for the same span in 2008-09. Lethal force, he said, is allowed ""when an agent is in imminent threat of physical or bodily harm, which could cause death or injury or in protection of an innocent third party."" The determination of when to use lethal force, Qualia said, is made by each individual agent at the scene. From October 1 through May 31, he said, Custom and Border Protection agents have used their firearms 31 times. Rock-throwing can be considered a dangerous assault, Qualia said: ""They're not chunking pebbles.""

177,"(CNN) -- The BP oil spill has brought into the public's eye the tragedy of oiled wildlife.  The pictures last week of pelicans completely covered in oil were horrific and rightly produced an outcry of rage from the public. Should these birds, and other oiled wildlife, be saved?  Much like the struggle to contain the oil itself, there are no quick fixes or easy answers. First, we need to emphasize that rescue and rehabilitation of oiled wildlife must be performed by trained wildlife professionals and volunteers. Without proper training, would-be rescuers can inadvertently harm or further stress oiled wildlife or be harmed themselves, either by struggling animals or the oil itself.  Rescuers must go through a weeklong training on the handling of hazardous materials as well as proper wildlife rescue techniques. Wildlife rehabilitation is difficult. It is more than simply retrieving, washing and releasing wildlife contaminated with oil. Rehabilitators not only clean wildlife but provide veterinary care and feeding.  Some animals are desperately ill, while others may need only minimal care.  Each animal is individually assessed and then treated appropriately. Experts may make the difficult decision that some creatures can't be saved. Read why some experts say birds should be euthanized . Even if we do everything right, the long-term survival of rehabilitated wildlife may be uncertain. Beyond the short-term threats of oil poisoning and hypothermia, surviving wildlife face potential loss of their food sources and habitat. And it's not as simple as moving affected individuals to a new location -- if a species moved 500 miles away from where it was originally lived, it might not be able to locate food and in some cases might even return to the original, oil-polluted location. Wildlife at risk from the BP oil spill include five species of threatened or endangered sea turtles, including the most endangered sea turtle in the world, the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle, which is largely dependent on the Gulf of Mexico. The brown pelican, in addition to having symbolic importance as Louisiana's state bird, was only recently taken off the Endangered Species List.  For species that are threatened or endangered, every individual is critically important to help contribute to the survival of these species. Some have argued that we shouldn't bother to try to save any oiled birds, that given the long odds many face, we should simply euthanize all of them. That line of thinking overlooks recent advances in wildlife rehabilitation. It also lumps the sickest birds together with ones that may only be mildly ill. More broadly, it misses the point that this isn't just about playing the percentages. Humanity is an important factor in the decision to rehabilitate oiled animals.  People caused this problem, and many feel it is our ethical duty to try to help the wildlife suffering as a result, even if the task is difficult and the outcome uncertain. At the National Wildlife Federation, we've heard from so many Americans who feel a sense of helplessness as the oil continues to gush and as BP's attempts to stop it continue to fail. Knowing that efforts are being made to save the innocent wildlife victims of this disaster not only helps the emotional stress of the public, it also gives them hope and rallies them to get involved, whether it's making a donation to the response effort or contacting their elected officials. The sad reality is that many of the Gulf's most critical species are now swimming against the current.  Rehabilitation is difficult, and survival is uncertain. This only underscores the critical importance of clean energy and climate legislation now so we can prevent these disasters from happening in the future. That's the only real way to ensure that we don't have to see more images of oiled wildlife struggling and dying in disasters of our own making. The best way to help personally is to give, which you can do by texting WILDLIFE to 20222 to donate $10 to the NWF Gulf Oil Spill Restoration Fund.

178,"(CNN) -- Oil coming ashore on the Gulf Coast has tourists keeping a close eye on conditions. States and visitors bureaus are working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . Small bits of tar were found at Henderson Beach State Park, just east of Destin, over the weekend, according to the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""These were easily removed, and no further oil has been spotted,"" said a post this week on the bureau's website. The Emerald Coast area, which includes Destin, Fort Walton Beach and Okaloosa Island, is urging travelers to visit. ""Our white-sand beaches remain open and our emerald-green waters remain clear. In addition, offshore fishing is still going strong, with captains simply taking a more easterly course and reporting great success out on the water,"" the site said. Destin Mayor Sarah ""Sam"" Seevers told CNN a few, small tar balls came ashore this week but added that spotting occasional tar balls on the beach there is not unusual. ""We may go five years and not see any tar balls, and then we'll see a few. That's just a way of life on the Gulf of Mexico, Seevers said. Navarre Beach is open, including waters for fishing, according to the Santa Rosa County website. Oil sheen and tar balls have been reported on the Alabama-Florida state line and off Navarre Beach. iReport from Santa Rosa Beach . The water at Pensacola Beach is open for swimming and fishing, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. The National Park Service reported heavier oiling at Perdido Key on Tuesday afternoon. A health advisory has been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama line to the entrance of Johnson Beach on Perdido Key, the visitors bureau website said. Swimming and fishing in the affected waters are not advised. The visitors bureau urges beachgoers to take precautions. ""According to [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], tar balls do not pose a health risk to the average person, but visitors are advised not to pick them up,"" the website said. Gulf Islands National Seashore, Mississippi and Florida . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites are open, according to the National Park Service website. Light oil occurrences at Horn and Petit Bois islands in Mississippi and Fort Pickens and the Santa Rosa area in Florida have been cleaned up.  Cleanup of heavier oiling at Perdido Key is ongoing. Health departments in both states urge people to avoid swimming in areas affected by the oil spill. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . In Alabama, the Department of Public Health has extended an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou or Old River. The beaches remain open. The U.S. Coast Guard has closed Perdido Pass, the main water access point to the town of Orange Beach. The pier at Gulf State Park in Gulf Shores is closed to fishing but open for sightseeing, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. Grand Isle, Louisiana . Oil is affecting more than 45 miles of Louisiana coast, according to a state emergency website, although most of the coast is unaffected. iReport from Grand Terre Island, Louisiana . ""The primary affected area is from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east. Over 75 percent of Louisiana's coastal waters extend westward from the mouth of the Mississippi River,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website. Grand Isle has closed its public beach, the site said. iReport from Grand Isle .","Health officials have issued an advisory against swimming in Alabama Gulf waters .

179,"(CNN) -- An unusual movie promotion stunt threatened to turn deadly Tuesday when a World War II-era biplane flipped over while landing near the nation's capital. Nobody was hurt, though one of the main runways at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport was closed for roughly an hour after the crash, an airport spokeswoman said. The plane was righted by a crane. The 1943 Stearman, a popular training aircraft during the war, was one of nine flying to Reagan National from Virginia's Manassas Regional Airport to help promote the movie ""Legends of Flight,"" a film meant to provide a window into ""a century of aviation trial and error,"" according to its Web site. The two-seat, open-cockpit plane ""took a back-end bounce,"" as it landed, movie executive producer Doug Freeman told CNN. ""The pilot and passenger got out unhurt"" and later relaxed over a cup of coffee. The pilot was identified as Michael Truschel of Nokesville, Virginia -- located near Manassas. The accident occurred at the end of a roughly 20-minute flight under clear skies and light winds. ""It looked like (Michael) was up on the main gear, and then the nose went down and the tail went up,"" said pilot Dave Brown, who was directly behind Truschel's aircraft. ""I sidestepped (Truschel) and landed right behind him,"" Brown told CNN. Air traffic controllers directed the other planes to land on another runway. Brown told CNN that ""by the time it happened, (Truschel) was going really slowly, so when it flipped over on its nose it just went on over on its top wing."" The main body of the overturned plane remained high enough off the ground for Truschel and his passenger to release their harnesses and then climb out. ""It shows how rigid Boeing made the plane,"" Brown noted. ""They were built as trainers for cadets who flipped them like this quite often."" Brown said there was damage to the tail, a wing and the prop of Truschel's plane.","WWII-era biplane flips while landing at Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C.

180,"(CNN) -- Australian authorities on Friday made contact with a 16-year-old American girl who triggered a distress signal while attempting to sail solo around the world. But it could be a day before a French fishing vessel pulls Abby Sunderland and her boat, Wild Eyes, to shore, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. ""She's in the boat. The boat's seaworthy. It's not taking on water, and she's equipped for the conditions down there, we believe,"" said Mick Kinley of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Sunderland triggered the distress signal Thursday during rough seas. ""She's been dismasted. The rigging's over the side and in the water,"" Kinley told reporters Friday. He said Wild Eyes was in the Southern Ocean about 2,000 miles southwest of Perth, Australia, when rescuers contacted her Friday. ""That's a long way from any merchant shipping,"" he said. ""We're just fortunate that the French fishing vessel was in that region."" Family spokesman Christian Pinkston said Sunderland communicated with rescuers via marina radio. ""We know that Australian search and rescue has contacted her ... and she is alive and well,"" Pinkston said early Friday morning. Sunderland's parents, Laurence and Marianne, wrote on her blog: ""We have just heard from the Australian Search and Rescue. The plane arrived on the scene moments ago. Wild Eyes is upright but her rigging is down. The weather conditions are abating. Radio communication was made and Abby reports that she is fine! ""We don't know much else right now. The French fishing vessel that was diverted to her location will be there in a little over 24 hours. Where they will take her or how long it will take we don't know."" Mom talks about dangers her daughter faces on high seas . Earlier Friday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority had taken over the search for Sunderland, noting the stormy seas that prompted her to activate her distress beacons had calmed. ""The weather is moderating. It is improving slightly,"" Carly Lusk of the AMSA said at the time. ""Now, it's not perfect, but any improvement in the weather is a positive when you're looking at a search and rescue operation."" Sunderland's vessel is adrift in the middle of the Indian Ocean some 2,000 miles east of Madagascar, 2,000 miles west of Australia and 500 miles north of the French Antarctic Islands. Sunderland's family began scrambling to organize a search-and-rescue effort for her after they learned her emergency beacon was detected just an hour after they last spoke to her on Thursday, according to Jeff Casher, an engineer on her support team. The government of Reunion -- a French island -- diverted a fishing boat toward her last known position, but it is not expected to reach the area until Saturday, Casher said. An Australian military ship, more than two days sail away, has also been dispatched, Casher said. Electronic signals from the boat indicate it is drifting at just a mile per hour, which means it is still afloat but not under sail, Casher said. iReporter follows the story . Sunderland began her journey from Marina del Rey, California, on January 23 with the goal of sailing her 40-foot boat around the world without stopping. Mechanical troubles forced her to make two stops for repairs, including at Cape Town, South Africa, in May. She has kept in touch with family and followers through a satellite telephone. Her website has published frequent blog updates, including one posted Wednesday. ""The last few days have (been) pretty busy out here,"" Sunderland wrote in her last blog entry. ""I've been in some rough weather for awhile with winds steady at 40-45 knots with higher gusts. With that front passing, the conditions were lighter today."" Sunderland is a ""very determined"" and ""very capable sailor,"" Thomas said. ""She's pretty much unfazed by most everything, but she had been fatigued by this period of winds which she's been going through for several days now,"" he said. When Abby's older brother Zac sailed around the world alone last year, with stops, he became the youngest person to ever do so at 17. Mike Perham of the United Kingdom, a younger 17-year-old, took over the distinction weeks later. Last month, Australian Jessica Watson, days before her 17th birthday, claimed to have become the youngest person to have completed a non-stop, unassisted solo circumnavigation -- a mark held by then 18-year-old Jesse Martin of Australia since 1999. However, sailing journalists have said -- and her team hasn't disputed -- that Watson's route was less than 21,600 orthodromic nautical miles, which is the length of the equator and the distance generally used for round-the-world sailing records. Abby has been on a schedule to complete her global journey about two months before her 17th birthday, which is on October 19. CNN's Samuel Gardner, Ed Payne, Irving Last and Allison Blakely contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities say 16-year-old has tools to survive at sea .

181,"Langley, Arkansas (CNN) -- One person remained missing Monday from last week's flash flood at an Arkansas campground that left 19 dead, and ""there's still a possibility there could be others,"" Gov. Mike Beebe told CNN. Rescuers found a 19th body over the weekend about half to three-quarters of a mile downstream from the campground, Arkansas State Police Capt. Mike Fletcher told reporters. Eighteen of the 19 bodies recovered so far have been identified, Fletcher said. A wall of water swept through the Albert Pike Recreation Area before dawn Friday, when most campers were sleeping. The park is located along the Caddo and Little Missouri rivers, and the flood struck so quickly there was little chance for campers to escape, officials said. ""I don't think any of this has been a good day,"" Fletcher said. ""I think we need to keep these families in our thoughts and our prayers."" But, he said, ""We're just going to keep on doing what we do and come to a conclusion on this."" More than 100 people combed the rugged woodlands of the Ouachita National Forest until nightfall Sunday, said Mike Quesinberry, the head of the rescue effort for the U.S. Forest Service. Fletcher said one searcher was overcome by heat exhaustion in Sunday's sweltering temperatures, which ranged into the mid-90s with high humidity. Quesinberry said the last two bodies found have been in piles of wood, rock and other debris along the riverbanks, and those are now the focus of the search. Six dog teams were included in the rescue effort, and authorities were planning to bring in more dogs and new equipment, he said. ""Some of these piles are just massive amounts of rock and debris,"" Quesinberry said. ""It's unsafe to get individuals in there with chainsaws and those type tools, so we've got heavy equipment coming in."" Funerals for two of the victims killed in the flash floods at a federal campground in Arkansas were scheduled for Tuesday. Services for Kylee Sullivan, 7, will be Tuesday morning, while her grandmother, Julie Freeman, will be buried that afternoon, Texarkana Funeral Home Director Kendall Hudson said. Authorities released the names of 15 of the dead Saturday, with six children among the victims, including one girl as young as 2 years old. Ages of the adult victims ranged from 23 to 69. Several groups of people with the same last name were listed. The victims identified were largely from Texas and Louisiana, with one person from Foreman, Arkansas. The warning system intended to notify campers on federal land about potentially devastating weather will be re-examined in Arkansas and throughout the nation, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Saturday.","NEW: ""There could be others"" as search for flood victims goes on, governor says .

182,"(CNN) -- Lightning strikes apparently caused a major fire at a gasoline pipeline company's ""tank farm"" in North Carolina early Sunday morning, fire officials said. The blaze started at Colonial Pipeline Company in Greensboro after midnight, said David Douglas, an assistant fire chief in Greensboro. A tank holding about 20,000 barrels of gasoline -- about half that tank's capacity -- caught fire. While some of the gasoline burned, some of it was safely transferred to another tank, according to Steve Baker, Colonial Pipeline's director of communications. Firefighters used foam to extinguish the flames on the tank, Baker said, adding that Greensboro firefighters kept water hoses trained on other tanks in the sprawling complex to keep them cool and prevent the fire from spreading. The huge facility is near Piedmont Triad International Airport, and the massive blaze sent plumes of smoke throughout the area. The blaze caused the temporary closure of a portion of Interstate 40, the North Carolina Department of Transportation said. There were no evacuations, Douglas said.

183,"(CNN) -- At least 15 people were killed and 45 others wounded in a bombing and gunfire near Iraq's central bank in the capital on Sunday, according to the Interior Ministry. After the initial blast, clashes broke out between security forces and armed men trying to rob the bank, the official said. There were conflicting reports about what the blast was, which hit at around 3 p.m. (8 a.m. ET). One Interior Ministry official said at least three roadside bombs exploded outside the bank, while another official said it was a suicide bomber. The spokesman for the Baghdad military command, Maj. Gen. Qassi, al-Moussawi, told state television that it was one roadside bomb. The casualties figures offered by the Interior Ministry only include civilians and security forces. The power generator for the bank caught fire and the burning fuel caused a large black plume of smoke seen over the capital, the first Interior Ministry official said.The bank is located in central Baghdad's Rasheed street. The bombing comes amid political uncertainty, a day before Iraq's parliament is set to convene for it's first session three months after national elections.

184,"(CNN) -- BP began deploying pressure sensors on its ruptured undersea well in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday in an effort to fine-tune estimates of the worst oil spill in U.S. history, government and company officials said. BP used remote-controlled submarines to begin positioning the sensors inside the well, located 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf, company spokesman Mark Proegler said. The sensors were requested by federal experts who have been trying to gauge how much oil has been pouring from the well, which experts say could have been spewing as much as 1.7 million gallons of oil a day into the Gulf. But Proegler said the devices may not yield accurate information for several days. ""It's not as if they'll plug these sensors in and get readings right away,"" he said. Researchers recently doubled estimates of how much oil has been flowing from the ruptured well, saying last week that up to 40,000 barrels -- or 1.7 million gallons -- a day may have leaked for weeks. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the Obama administration's point man on the disaster, said the sensors will help give those researchers a better picture of the flow rate. ""We think we need some independent pressure readings to validate the estimates that have been made by the scientists looking at the video and some other acoustic data,"" Allen said Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" Allen's deputy, Rear Adm. James Watson, has given BP until Sunday to provide alternative plans that adequately address substantially higher rates of oil flow. The company said Saturday that it was reviewing a letter from Watson, but no response had been disclosed late Sunday. The oil is believed to have been pouring into the Gulf since the April 20 explosion that sank the offshore drill rig Deepwater Horizon, killing 11 workers. The spill now dwarfs the 11 million gallons that were dumped into Alaska's Prince William Sound when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in 1989, and oil in varying amounts and consistencies has hit the shores of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Allen said the battle against the oil ""continues to widen,"" with efforts now being focused on the stretch of open water between the wellhead and about 15 miles off the coast. ""Rather than trying to capture all around the well head, we've got to get our skimmers further offshore and protect it so we minimize the amount of oil that comes ashore,"" he said. Allen's comments came on the eve of President Barack Obama's fourth scheduled visit to the stricken Gulf region, a two-day trip that will be followed by a Tuesday night address to the nation. Obama is scheduled to visit Mississippi, Alabama and Florida on Monday and Tuesday, then meet with BP executives on Wednesday. BP has captured some of the gushing oil through a containment cap that has been pumping the crude up to a drilling ship for about a week. BP said it collected more than 15,000 barrels of oil on Saturday and more than 7,700 by noon Sunday. But despite this advancement, pressure has not been removed from BP. White House adviser David Axelrod said Sunday the Obama administration wants BP to set up a massive, independently administered fund for cleaning up the oil-stricken Gulf states. ""The president will use every legal device at his disposal to make sure that this money is escrowed and that there is an independent administrator so that claims are not slow-walked, people can get the relief they need in a timely fashion and that we don't create more victims from this terrible disaster,"" Axelrod told reporters. He said administration lawyers have advised ""that we have the authority to compel such an escrow fund, if it comes to that."" Estimates of the cleanup costs and the damages BP will owe to businesses and residents on the Gulf Coast range from $3 billion to $40 billion. BP said it already has spent more than $1 billion trying to cap the spill and clean up the areas affected by the oil. Axelrod did not discuss how much money might be set up in the fund. But Allen told CBS that BP was ""a company that's got a lot of wealth inside it."" And a group of 54 Senate Democrats -- nearly all the Democratic caucus -- has called on BP to put $20 billion in trust for the spill. In a letter to the oil company's CEO, Tony Hayward, they note that the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound cost $7 billion, but Exxon paid far less for damages while continuing to make major profits. Alabama Gov. Bob Riley told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that he didn't care how the money was paid out. But he said BP owed ""every one"" of his state's Gulf Coast businesses. ""I don't think there is a dividing line,"" said Riley, a Republican. ""I don't think you can say that one group is going to get it and another one doesn't. If a restaurant in Gulf Shores, Alabama, is off 50 percent because the tourists didn't come, I think he is owed 50 percent of his revenues from last year. ""The same thing with anyone in these areas, because the whole economy is based on the tourist market,"" he said. ""And when it goes away, someone's got to compensate them, because most of these people are not going to be here next year if we don't."" Riley also criticized the Obama administration's handling of the disaster, saying the ""unified command"" set up with the federal government and BP is mounting a disjointed response. ""You can't have a committee making the decisions that are going to impact this entire coastal area. You can't have someone come in and say, 'Well, if it gets onto the beach, we'll clean it up and we'll clean it up rapidly,' and then OSHA come in and say, 'Well, the people can't work but 20 minutes out of an hour or two hours a day,' and get it cleaned up. Someone is . going to have to be in charge of each one of these operations,"" he said. Riley, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist are scheduled to meet with the president during his two-day visit. Barbour told CBS he was pleased to hear Allen talk of trying to fight the oil offshore rather than on the beaches, but said he would push Obama to end the six-month moratorium he slapped on offshore oil exploration since the disaster began. Obama has said no drilling should go forward until investigators determine the cause of the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon. But Barbour said Obama ""is going to hurt the national economy"" if the temporary ban isn't lifted. ""There have been more than 30,000 oil wells drilled in the Gulf of Mexico in the last 50 years. This is the first time something like this has ever happened. And we need to get to the bottom of it, find out what happened, make sure it doesn't happen again. But I think it is very reasonable to continue to drill,"" Barbour said.","NEW: Deadline for new plan nears .

185,"(CNN) -- The 16-year-old California girl rescued from her stricken boat in the Indian Ocean says she is ""safe and sound"" and argues that her age shouldn't be blamed for the problems she encountered while at sea. ""Storms are part of the deal when you set out to sail around the world,"" Abby Sunderland wrote in a blog on her website dated Saturday. ""As for age, since when does age create gigantic waves and storms?"" Criticism has emerged that she was too young to embark on such a journey, which apparently has ended. Abby lost satellite contact on Thursday and issued a distress call after what was described as a rogue wave hit the boat, damaging its mast and communications equipment. A French fishing vessel reached a remote area in the Indian Ocean on Saturday morning to fetch her. ""There are plenty of things people can think of to blame for my situation; my age, the time of year and many more,"" Abby said in the blog. She added that ""it was just a Southern Ocean storm."" ""The truth is, I was in a storm and you don't sail through the Indian Ocean without getting in at least one storm."" It will be several weeks before she is home in California, rescuers said. Her parents praised people from France and Australia for their help in reaching their stranded daughter. ""Their professionalism and the great value that they placed on Abby's life has been a gift to us that we can never repay. Thank you for caring for our daughter as if she were your own, for answering all of our many questions cheerfully and completely and for going above and beyond our wildest expectations to keep Abby safe,"" Laurence and Marianne Sunderland said in a post on the girl's website. The parents, who also briefed reporters in Thousand Oaks, California on Saturday said they were overjoyed their daughter was found. As for her boat, Wild Eyes, it had to be left in the middle of the ocean, and Abby said she's ""still trying to get over the fact that I will never see my Wild Eyes again."" Responding to questions from reporters on whether Abby was too young to take such a voyage, her father defended her skill. ""What this is about is a young lady who has a great skill on the ocean and a passion for bluewater sailing. She's a remarkable young lady and has done a remarkable job on 'Wild Eyes; sailing it over half way around the world,"" he said.","Teen sailor should be back home in weeks .

186,"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa died Tuesday at a hospital in Paris nearly two months after suffering a stroke, Zambian and French officials confirmed. He was 59. Levy Mwanawasa, president of Zambia, died after suffering a stroke nearly two months ago. Mwanawasa fell ill in late June at an African Union summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, Zambian officials said at the time. Mwanawasa's death ""is a great loss for the Zambian people who respected and had great affection for him,"" according to a statement from French President Nicolas Sarkozy. ""It's a great loss for the African continent as a whole, which appreciated his political courage,"" Sarkozy's statement said. ""It's a big loss for democracy, for which he was an ardent defender his whole life. ""France salutes his memory, full of courage and liberty."" The Zambian leader was taken from a hospital in Egypt to an intensive care unit in Paris in June, but initial reports that he died days later turned out to be false. Mwanawasa would have turned 60 on September 3. President Bush also issued a statement mourning the loss of Mwanawasa, described by the U.S. leader as ""a champion of democracy in his own country and throughout Africa."" ""As President of Zambia, President Mwanawasa launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign and dedicated himself to improving the welfare of all Zambians,"" according to the White House statement. ""As Chairman of the Southern African Development Community, President Mwanawasa worked tirelessly to uphold the values of good governance, speaking out against human rights abuses and threats to democracy when many others were silent. ""On behalf of the United States, we extend our sincere condolences to President Mwanawasa's wife, his family, and all Zambians during this difficult time.""

187,"(CNN) -- Could another deep water -- or even shallow water -- oil drilling disaster be looming ahead? Experts warn it certainly could happen again. The Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, they say, highlights flaws in the drilling industry's main defense against oil and gas explosions -- the blowout preventer, which is supposed to shut down an oil and gas well if something goes wrong. Oil companies have treated such devices as virtually fail-safe. ""They're certainly not fail-safe because they didn't close this well. If they had been 100 percent fail-safe they would have sealed, they would have closed,"" said Petroleum Engineering Professor Paul Bommer of the University of Texas at Austin. Indeed, there have been numerous rig blowouts, including a large gusher in the Timor Sea off the coast of Western Australia last year. A growing number of blowouts have caused offshore oil drilling to become sloppier in the past decade. There were 72 spills that dumped 18,000 barrels of oil into U.S. federal waters from 2000-2009, compared to just 15 spills that put 2,000 barrels into the water during the prior decade, according to data compiled by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Interior Department, which regulates energy exploration. (The database excludes spills of less than 50 barrels). Avoiding such spills depends upon the reliability of the blowout preventer, which is essentially a faucet on top of the oil well that keeps oil and gas from gushing to the surface. Rig workers use the preventer to keep a well under control, especially when oil and gas surge or ""kick up"" from a well. When its valves don't do the job, the blowout preventer can choke off the drilling pipe-- like squeezing a straw while drinking. And, if that fails to work, a blowout preventer has yet another line of defense -- huge shear rams -- like giant scissors that are supposed to be able to cut and seal the drilling pipe. But, a mile underwater, where the pressure is intense, drill pipes need to be thick, especially the joints between them. And those joints are very hard to cut. ""There are some parts of the pipe that the shears were never meant to cut,"" said Ford Brett, an expert in petroleum project management who is advising the Interior Department's oil drilling safety review. ""No one's equipment will shear the drill collar body. That's a lot of metal. It's not going to be possible to shear certain things,"" added Benton Baugh, another advisor to Interior's review of the Deepwater incident and President of Radoil, which designs and manufactures oilfield and subsea drilling equipment. A 2002 study for the Minerals Management Service warned of such trouble in shearing drilling pipe deep underwater. Initial research painted, ""a grim picture of the probability of success when utilizing this final tool in securing a well,"" wrote consultant West Engineering Services. West Engineering would not comment to CNN on its studies for the government. ""The blowout preventers had a probability of failing to crush that pipe that approaches 50 percent,"" said Professor Robert Bea of the University of California at Berkeley who is familiar with the study. ""It would be like getting on an airplane having a 50 percent chance of making it to your destination,"" added Bea. Based on 55 years of engineering experience, including a stint as chief offshore engineer for Shell, Bea is warning government investigators that blowout preventers are not reliable in the deep sea and he worries they could fail in the Arctic, where the industry is pursuing energy resources. ""You can keep on pushing equipment to the point of where it breaks, and I think we broke it. All of the drilling operations underway of this nature in the world today depend on these devices as the final line of defense."" In the harshest of environments, a mile underwater or in the Arctic Tundra, blowout preventers operate under great stress, increasing their potential vulnerability to wear and tear. ""It is a mechanical piece of equipment. It is utilized in harsh environments. Yes, it can wear out,"" said Professor Steve Sears, chair of the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Louisiana State University. In fact, BP told congressional investigators there were several leaks in the hydraulic system that was supposed to power the shear rams of the Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventer. ""It was a coupling that had not been tightened down adequately. It was several turns loose,"" said a person with knowledge of the investigation. BP officials also discovered a dead battery. The final safety switch for a blowout preventer that has lost communication with its oil rig is the ""deadman"" system that's supposed to trigger the blowout preventer to shut the well. It did not activate during the Transocean April 20th rig explosion. Another study West Engineering Services prepared for the Minerals Management System in 2003 found flaw with the deadman system. ""The most serious drawback to this system ...is the mind set of the rig personnel. Many operator and contractor personnel refuse to arm the system from fear that it will either not operate when needed or activate inappropriately, causing downtime."" Such downtime can be extremely costly. If the blowout preventer cuts through drilling pipe it can easily cost $10-million to replace that section of pipe and put the rig back into production, said Baugh. Given the multiple problems with blowout preventers energy experts concede the oil industry must quickly raise its safety bar. ""We must improve the safety systems of blowout preventers. Obviously it's time to take it to the next level,"" said Baugh. ""There are more strenuous conditions occurring and we must have more strenuous solutions for them."" The Interior Department, facing the reality of energy drilling dangers, is in the process of toughening rules for offshore oil exploration. ""We must ensure that offshore drilling is conducted safely and in compliance with the law,"" said Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. Drilling operations not subject to the administration's six-month deepwater drilling moratorium have until the end of the month to: . -- Provide independent third party verification of the safety and effectiveness of blowout preventers; . -- Install a secondary control system for subsea blowout preventers (current regulations do not require such a backup); . -- And, adhere to new inspection and reporting requirements for blowout preventers. By September the Interior Department intends to require blowout preventers to have two sets of sheer rams spaced at least four feet apart in case a drill pipe joint is in front of a shear during an emergency. The Interior Department says such steps will ""increase the safety in offshore oil and gas development,"" but concedes they, ""represent only the beginning of the Department's work.""","Blowout preventers are supposed to cut off flow from oil wells .

Petit Bois island was cleaned up and has been free of oil as of Sunday, the site said. The spill also has affected parts of the Gulf Islands National Seashore in Florida. Cleanup crews have been working on medium and heavier oil coverage at Perdido Key, Fort Pickens and Santa Rosa. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . In Alabama, the Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in Gulf waters or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan. The beaches remain open. The pier at Gulf State Park in Gulf Shores is closed to fishing but open for sightseeing, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. Oil has been reported on shore at Dauphin Island, Fort Morgan and Gulf Shores. Pensacola and Perdido Key, Florida . The waters in Pensacola and Perdido Key are open Monday for swimming and fishing, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Officials have not issued closures or health advisories for the area, the bureau's website said. Several tar balls were spotted in the area over the weekend.

189,"Dareta, Nigeria (CNN) -- In remote northern Nigeria, it is now a race against time to prevent a catastrophe in the world's worst-ever recorded outbreak of lead poisoning. Officially 163 people have already died in Zamfara state -- 111 of them children. But no one knows the true figures. ""You read about it in the literature but several hundred children have died here as a result of what happened here,"" says Ian von Lindern from the environmental engineering organization the Blacksmith Institute, which is heading the clean-up operation in the region. Children began to die in January, but only now in June has the clean-up operation begun in the mud-hut village of Dareta. Using the only tools available -- crude metal hoes normally used for farming -- local villagers are trying to clear the contaminated topsoil from the worst-affected housing compounds. Dug up, the soil is put into plastic bags and buried far from the village. Young children look on as their friends and family wear unfamiliar white protective suits and face masks. And they inhale more of the stirred-up dust. The U.S.-based Blacksmith Institute -- a global leader in pollution clean-up operations -- has found disturbingly high levels of lead across the village. ""The fact that this is 10,000 parts per million -- which is 1 percent lead -- that's very high,"" explains Casey Bartram of the Blacksmith Institute. In the U.S., the standard for residential-area soils is normally 400 parts per million. ""Because lead particles are so small, the levels so high, and because in this environment the kids are always in contact with the soil -- it's extremely dangerous for them to be exposed to levels like these,"" says Bartram. The Blacksmith Institute currently is trying to help clean up a toxic lead site in Senegal where, in the last few years, 18 people died. Until now, it was the worst case of lead poisoning anyone had seen. ""We were asked if we'd come over and look at this [site] so we only planned on a four-day visit -- but it's so bad we just have to stay and do what we can,"" says von Lindern. Many of the men in the region are gold miners. They bring the metal ore mined from the local mines back to be crushed by their wives and children in their homes. Unbeknownst to them, the gold ore contains extremely high levels of lead. The ore processing has since been moved out of most of the villages and, in theory, the lead could be cleared away. ""I will instruct all the people to excavate their houses,"" the local chief, Mohammed Bello, declares. ""But it will be difficult to enforce because of poverty."" There are also many other problems. Just getting to Dareta village takes several hours' drive -- a journey that will soon be made almost impossible with the oncoming rains. And with the rains coming, the young men working to clear away the contaminated earth are anxious to get to their farms. Simba Terima of the Blacksmith Institute is helping train them in safely removing the contaminated soil. ""This is a local problem, this is not an international problem,"" he says. ""So if they can own it, it'll be very good because long, long after we're gone they will be here."" It is hoped that Dareta village will be cleared in 26 days, but manpower is still lacking. The local government, apart from handing out red election hats for an upcoming vote, is almost nowhere to be seen. ""I tell you that the problem has now been contained and we are now on remediation,"" explains Abubakar Maru, the local environmental commissioner. ""I'm sure these measures are good enough."" The government claims there have been no more fatalities since it first identified the problem as lead poisoning. However, Dareta is only one of seven villages identified with extremely toxic levels of lead -- and the only village in the region receiving an on-going clean-up operation. From reports, some of the other villages are not being monitored properly. And there has been no thorough report on whether there are more villages suffering from the same toxic levels of lead. ""We hope to do just this village before the rainy season, but by mid-July there'll be so much rain we won't be able to, and we'll have to wait until October,"" says von Lindern. ""The kids will still be exposed."" On Sunday, the village cleared its first compound. For now, villagers are just taking it one home at a time.","Outbreak of lead poisoning has killed 163 in remote northern Nigerian state .

190,"(CNN) -- Oil coming ashore on the Gulf Coast has tourists keeping a close eye on conditions. States and visitors bureaus are working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . All of Florida's beaches remain open, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. Scattered tar balls have been found from the Alabama-Florida state line east to Walton County. ""There have been no reports of Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill-related oil products reaching the shore beyond the Northwest Florida region,"" Visit Florida's website said. iReport: Track the oil disaster . A portion of beach was closed Saturday in Panama City, Florida, after an oil container with BP markings washed ashore. There have been no oil impacts, the Panama City Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau website said. The water at Pensacola Beach is open for swimming and fishing, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. A health advisory has been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama line to the entrance of Johnson Beach on Perdido Key, the Pensacola Bay Area visitors bureau said. Swimming and fishing in the affected waters are not advised. Gulf Islands National Seashore . The National Park Service reported heavier oiling at Perdido Key last week. The area is part of the Florida portion of Gulf Islands National Seashore. All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are located in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the park service's website said. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama, have experienced significant oiling, accoring to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. Public beaches in both cities are flying double red flags, meaning the waters are closed to the public. The beaches remain open for sunbathing and walking, the visitors bureau site said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou or Old River. Grand Isle, Louisiana . Oil is affecting more than 45 miles of Louisiana coast, according to a state emergency website, although most of the coast is unaffected. ""The primary affected area is from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east. Over 75 percent of Louisiana's coastal waters extend westward from the mouth of the Mississippi River,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website. Grand Isle has closed its public beach, the site said.","Health officials have issued an advisory against swimming in Alabama Gulf waters .

191,"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Long truck convoys inched their way through heavy traffic in Haiti's capital Thursday, bringing relief efforts into full view in parts of Port-au-Prince. A 40-vehicle convoy that seemed to be coming from the neighboring Dominican Republic headed into town Thursday afternoon on the Route Nationale in western Port-au-Prince. Escorted by heavily armed United Nations troops, the convoy had more than two dozen tractor-trailers, in addition to water and fuel tankers and even an armored car toward the back of the caravan. Some of the trucks carried the insignia of the Catholic Relief Services organization, while other vehicles bore markings identifying them as being from the Dominican Republic. Other aid and military vehicles traveled elsewhere in western Port-au-Prince, particularly on Boulevards T. L'Ouverture and 15 de Octobre. Residents as well as caregivers had complained earlier this week that aid was not getting out quickly enough. Full coverage | Twitter updates . For the second day in a row, the city gave indications of coming back to life. The sidewalks were crowded with street vendors and kiosks, and many small food stores were open. Dozens of stalls at a dusty market sold fruits and vegetables along a pocked and rut-filled dirt side street. A smaller market on a street corner saw some business. On the Route Nationale, residents crowded around the back of a parked brown semi-tractor trailer for hours before the back doors opened and local aid workers handed each person a six-pack of bottled water. The throng seemed relatively orderly, and no commotion was noticed. Long lines formed in front of some of the city's money-transfer offices, which opened for the first time since the January 12 quake that shattered large parts of Port-au-Prince. Haitians in line were there to pick up money sent to them from elsewhere, mainly the United States. iReport: List of missing, found | Are you there? Streets were choked with tap-taps, the brightly painted small pickup trucks that have been converted into passenger minibuses, with 10 or 12 people sitting on two facing benches on the truck bed. Many tap-taps carry Christian inspirations such as ""Jesus saves"" on their windshields and have intricate designs and messages on the side walls. Haitian police and U.N. military vehicles were common, and local authorities seemed to take an increased posture. Five national police officers, easily identified by their camouflage uniforms, jumped out of their truck at an intersection in the Cite de Soleil neighborhood near the harbor. They investigated men at the rear of two small pickups stopped there. One officer dropped to his right knee and briefly pointed his rifle toward the men. He and the other officers then abruptly turned around and walked away a few seconds later. Impact Your World . Cite de Soleil is the poorest and roughest neighborhood in the city, known more for its rampant crime and violence than its poetic-sounding name. Like all other parts of Port-au-Prince, many residents say it has fallen into increasing disrepair since the 1980s. A nearby neighborhood, Carrefour, was once a tourist destination but has become a run-down, lower-class neighborhood.","A 40-vehicle convoy loaded with supplies heads into western Port-au-Prince .

192,"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- In the hours after a 2005 refinery explosion that left 15 people dead, a BP executive suggested a holiday weekend and the national furor over a Florida woman's last days would eclipse the tragedy. With the oil company now battling to save an image tarnished by the worst oil spill in U.S. history, the lawyer who found that e-mail among a mountain of BP documents says nothing appears to have changed. ""Their strategy is the same every time ... And it's always, first, damage control,"" Brent Coon told CNN. ""And with damage control, they accentuate the positive, downplay the negative, tell everybody they're sorry, they're gonna fix it, they're gonna do better, and not to worry."" Coon represented many of the victims of the March 2005 explosion at BP's refinery in Texas City, near Houston. The blast killed 15 workers and injured 180, with many of the survivors suffering severe burns, amputations and broken bones. During litigation that followed, Coon extracted about 7 million documents from the company, including the e-mail that discussed whether the upcoming Easter weekend would push the explosion off the public stage. SIU blog: Internal e-mail shows how BP handles a crisis . ""Looks like injuries and loss of life are heavy. Expect a lot of follow up coverage tomorrow. Then I believe it will essentially go away -- due to the holiday weekend,"" BP America public relations chief Patricia Wright advised other executives. Wright added, ""This is a very big story in the U.S. right now -- but the Terry Schiavo story is huge as well."" Read the email . Schiavo was the severely brain-damaged Florida woman whose case became the centerpiece of a national right-to-die battle, and the controversy was reaching a climax just as the Texas City explosion occurred. Coon said the document made him ""sick to my stomach."" But he says the stacks of paper, e-mails and slides uncovered after the Texas City blast offer a rare insight into the culture of BP and may take on a new meaning in light of the massive Gulf spill. BP is now under fire for its failure to shut down a ruptured undersea well in the Gulf of Mexico, a spill that now dwarfs the 1989 grounding of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound. Critics say it has downplayed the scale of the disaster, underreported the amount of oil leaking and is trying to keep images of the gusher under wraps. With its stock plummeting and the environmentally friendly image it spent years cultivating taking a beating, the company has taken out full-page newspaper ads and aired television spots in which CEO Tony Hayward apologizes for the spill and vows, ""We will make this right."" But Coon said BP appears to be following ""the same course of conduct"" it did after Texas City. ""I don't think there's a shred of evidence in BP's favor that shows that they've done anything to change their corporate safety culture,"" he said. BP has not responded to multiple requests for interviews with either CEO Tony Hayward or another executive familiar with the Texas City documents. At least four of the people included on Wright's e-mail are still working as spokespeople for BP, CNN has found. The Gulf spill began when the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon, owned by BP contractor Transocean Ltd., blew up and sank off Louisiana, taking 11 workers with it. BP, Transocean and oilfield services contractor Halliburton all have pointed fingers at each other in hearings in Washington and in New Orleans. Coon says the documents his law firm unearthed in the Texas City case showed BP employees warned that corners at the plant were being cut, and dangerous conditions were being ignored. ""Quit waiting for a known possible disaster to happen before correcting the problem,"" one worker wrote. Another stated, ""This company deliberately put my life in danger to try and save a buck."" A third complained, ""If this facility was an aircraft carrier, we would be at the bottom of the ocean."" Read BP employees' comments . ""What was shocking was that we didn't just find that smoking gun,"" Coon said. ""We found an entire arsenal. You could have fitted an army with all of the smoking guns that we found in this."" Also among the documents that turned up in the lawsuit was a guide to filling out incident reports, created by lawyers hired by BP, that urged workers to ""avoid language that is negative, inflammatory or implies criminal intent or willful misconduct."" Coon dubbed one slide from the BP presentation the ""dirty words document,"" which tells workers to avoid terms like ""reckless,"" ""careless"" or ""incompetent."" ""They don't want to have anything in any of their reports or anything in writing that indicates that they did anything wrong,"" he said. The Texas City blast killed 15 BP contractors who were housed in a trailer near the site of the explosion, which originated with equipment used to boost the octane levels in gasoline. In 2007, BP pleaded guilty to a felony, agreed to pay $21 million in fines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and paid another $50 million in criminal penalties in connection with the disaster. The plea agreement required the company to fix the problems that led to the explosion. But when that didn't happen, they fined BP again in 2009 -- an $87 million proposed penalty that would be the largest in the agency's history if upheld. BP is contesting those citations and the assessed penalties. Coon said the Texas City case shows BP ""has a lot of systemic problems that they are never going to change unless somebody makes them change."" ""If they don't make them change, something worse is going to happen,"" he said. ""And it won't be that long. And it did happen.""","Documents show BP's concern over media coverage of deadly 2005 Texas refinery explosion .

194,"(CNN) -- A flight attendant with a pilot's license ditched her normal duties and stepped in for a sick copilot of an American Airlines flight before the plane landed in Chicago, Illinois, airline officials said. The first officer had become sick with ""flulike"" symptoms Monday, according to Tim Wagner, a spokesman for American Airlines. ""He went back into the passenger cabin,"" he said. ""That's when the captain began to solicit help from any passengers with a pilot's license."" One of the five flight attendants on board flight 1612 from San Francisco, California, told the captain that she is a commercial pilot, and she immediately took over the first officer's responsibilities, Wagner said. The Chicago Tribune has identified the flight attendant as Patti DeLuna, 61. ""I was the best available [backup pilot] they had on the plane,"" DeLuna told the Chicago Tribune. ""I spent a lot of time in the cockpit looking at the flight deck and asking questions. My first question to the captain was, 'Where are the brakes?'"" The plane, carrying 225 passengers and seven crew members, landed safely at O'Hare International Airport at 4:24 p.m. Monday. The first officer, who is based in Chicago, was immediately taken to the hospital by paramedics waiting on the ground. He was treated and released and was resting Tuesday, Wagner said. ""The entire incident was handled very well on all accounts,"" Wagner said. He was not able to elaborate on the flight attendant's background Tuesday afternoon or provide any details of her piloting experience. The flight attendant is based in San Francisco, the captain in St. Louis, Missouri.","First officer of flight with 225 passengers aboard had ""flulike"" symptoms .

195,"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama used his first Oval Office address to the nation Tuesday to say 90 percent of the oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico will be captured within weeks, and to call for a new clean energy policy to end U.S. dependence on fossil fuels. The 18-minute speech, televised nationally, described what happened in the April 20 explosion and fire on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig that led to what Obama called ""the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced."" He compared the millions of gallons of oil leaking into the ocean to an epidemic ""we will be fighting for months and even years."" Obama meets Wednesday with the chairman of oil giant BP, which owns the broken well at the bottom of the Gulf, and the president made clear he expects BP to pay all clean-up costs and damages from the massive leak. He said he will tell BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg to ""set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company's recklessness."" ""This fund will not be controlled by BP,"" Obama said. ""In order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner, the account must and will be administered by an independent, third party."" In response to Obama's speech, a BP spokesperson said the company shared the president's goals of ""shutting off the well as quickly as possible, cleaning up the oil and mitigating the impact on the people and environment of the Gulf Coast,"" and looked forward to Wednesday's meeting ""for a constructive discussion about how best to achieve these mutual goals."" Earlier, senior administration officials told reporters that negotiations on the BP fund were continuing, with one major unresolved issue being whether workers who lose their jobs due to the government's six-month moratorium on offshore drilling will be eligible to file damage claims. Republican critics have complained the moratorium is eliminating badly needed jobs as the nation recovers from economic recession, but Obama said the government must ensure the safety of such deep-water operations before allowing them to continue. Obama said he knows the moratorium ""creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs."" ""But for the sake of their safety, and for the sake of the entire region, we need to know the facts before we allow deep-water drilling to continue,"" he said. Obama also called the Gulf oil disaster ""the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now."" The United States must end its dependence on fossil fuels, he said, calling for Congress to rise above partisan politics to take on the challenge of passing energy reform legislation that will lead the way to development of a clean energy economy. In an attempt to counter complaints of a sluggish government response to the oil disaster, Obama noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with ""thousands of ships and other vessels."" He said he had authorized deployment of more than 17,000 National Guard members along the coast to be used as needed by state governors. Republican responses, some distributed to reporters before the speech began, criticized Obama for using the oil disaster to push his energy reform policies, which GOP critics say will increase energy prices and eliminate jobs. ""Every day seems to bring more bad news about the size and scope of this crisis, and reversing that trend should be the president's priority,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""The White House may view this oil spill as an opportunity to push its agenda in Washington, but Americans are more concerned about what it plans to do to solve the crisis at hand,"" McConnell said. He complained the energy reform legislation supported by Obama also is endorsed by BP and will ""raise energy prices for every American family and business"" but ""won't end our dependence on foreign oil or protect the coastline and marshes of the Gulf coast."" Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said the administration's focus should be on stopping the leak, not pushing Obama's policies. ""I am concerned the administration is attempting to capitalize on public outrage over the spill in order to push through a cap-and-trade bill that will significantly raise energy prices for all Americans and add more burdens on businesses,"" Hutchison said in a statement. ""Right now, the president's number one priority needs to be keeping the jobs in the energy sector from going overseas and restoring the Gulf of Mexico."" Environmentalists supported Obama's call for Congress to pass energy reform legislation, with former Vice President Al Gore, now chairman of the Alliance for Climate Protection, saying that ""in the midst of the greatest environmental disaster in our country's history, there is no excuse to do otherwise."" Ultimately, Gore said in statement, ""the only way to prevent this type of tragedy from happening again is to fundamentally change how we power our economy."" Earlier Tuesday, Obama named Michael Bromwich to direct the federal government's efforts to regulate offshore oil drilling. Bromwich, who was a Justice Department inspector general in the Clinton administration, will oversee the reorganized agencies that formerly comprised the Minerals Management Service in the Department of Interior. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told ABC News on Tuesday morning that Obama's goal is to ""restore the Gulf, not just the way it was the day the rig exploded, but years ago."" Presidents have tackled a variety of topics in Oval Office speeches -- from the Challenger disaster in 1986 to the attacks of September 11, 2001. Energy was last a topic in 1979, when Jimmy Carter spoke about America's inability to overcome the energy crisis. While Obama has dealt with major issues including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a major economic downturn since taking office in January 2009, he had never spoken to the public from the Oval Office until now.

196,"(CNN) -- The oil spill on the Gulf Coast has states and visitors bureaus working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . Officials are advising against getting in the water in Destin, Fort Walton Beach and Okaloosa Island because of the increased presence of tar balls, according to the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors bureau, which represents the three destinations. The beaches remain open. ""Oil in the water is being skimmed and any balls that reach the beach are being removed as quickly as possible,"" the bureau's website said Thursday. iReport: See photos from Okaloosa Island . Dime-size to 5-inch tar balls continue to wash up in widely scattered areas of Northwest Florida, but all of the state's beaches remain open, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. ""There have been no reports of Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill-related oil products reaching the shore beyond the Northwest Florida region,"" Visit Florida's website said. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . There have been no oil effects in Panama City Beach, Florida, and the area's beaches and waters are open, the  Panama City Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau website said. The water at Pensacola Beach is also open for swimming and fishing, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""On Pensacola Beach there are reports of tar balls and sheen on less than one percent of the entire beach,"" the bureau's website said. Due to heavier oiling on Perdido Key, a health advisory has been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama line to the entrance of Johnson Beach on Perdido Key, the Pensacola Bay Area visitors bureau said. Swimming and fishing in the affected waters are not advised. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore beaches, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. In Florida, Fort Pickens and Perdido Key had increased oiling earlier in the week. Tar balls and light oiling have affected Petit Bois and Horn islands this week in Mississippi. ""Surveillance for oiling continues throughout all park areas on a daily basis. Clean-up operations continue throughout the park,"" the website said. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama, have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. The beaches remain open for sunbathing and walking, but both cities are flying double red flags at public beaches, meaning the waters are closed for swimming or wading. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. The city of Gulf Shores has suspended beach parking fees ""as a way to thank visitors for traveling to the coast,"" the website said. Grand Isle, Louisiana . Oil is affecting more than 45 miles of Louisiana coast, according to a state emergency website, although most of the coast is unaffected.

197,"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- On the first day of school after the earthquake, Medlika Rameau told her classmates about how she was trapped in the rubble of her house with her mother and little sister. Rameau's leg was pinned under concrete. Her mother wanted rescuers to amputate her left leg so she could be pulled out. ""I prefer to die with my two legs,"" said the 13-year-old Wednesday, looking down at her small feet in flowery flip flops. When she heard her mother screaming and crying, she made one last push to get her leg out and free herself. She managed to escape with a big gash, now neatly bandaged. She recounted her story from a makeshift classroom in the cemetery of a Catholic retreat center in the badly damaged neighborhood of Sainte Marie. For Rameau and 400 other fellow students, Wednesday returned a huge sense of normalcy to their lives: school. While aid groups have been delivering water, food and hygiene items to quake-devastated Haitians, few have received counseling for bearing witness to horror. Among them, tens of thousands of children -- some already impoverished and vulnerable -- who now must live with the added burden of terrible memories. Counselors from Israeli aid agency Natan I-Relief have been training the young teachers at Sainte Marie, who themselves suffered in the earthquake, on how to cope with their experiences. The first step: Talk about it. One by one on Wednesday, each child rose in their makeshift classrooms -- some in the open, some in tents with damaged tables salvaged from the wreckage of their old school. They recounted how they lost mothers, fathers and their homes and they talked about the bleakness of life under a makeshift tent. Many came to school with physical injuries. Psychologist Moshe Farchi described a ""golden month"" that was critical in the prevention of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. If survivors can talk through what they experienced and return to some semblance of routine within a month after tragedy, they are more likely to recover, he said. ""What's most important is they try to go back to a routine,"" said Farchi, whose aid group has been working at the school and Catholic retreat center in Sainte Marie since the earthquake. In that sense, a resumption of classes was vital. Farchi encourages teachers to help the children piece together a chronology of what happened. Otherwise, he said, ""there's no putting an end to the story."" The next step is to take control of their lives again; to not think of themselves as victims, but as survivors. Some children were afraid to even use the word earthquake. They called it ""the thing."" It's another way of avoiding dealing with pain, Farchi said. ""We encourage them to say words like 'earthquake' and 'falling houses,' "" he said. ""To say that people were killed."" An estimated 5,000 schools in Port-au-Prince were destroyed or damaged in the January 12 earthquake. Some privately run schools that are able to supply a safe space for classes, including Sainte Marie, were allowed to reopen this week. But it will take months to get the school system, among the world's poorest, up and running again. The students at Sainte Marie were happy to be back in class. Even though their building was gone, school was the only thing about their lives that still seemed the same -- to see their teachers and play with friends. ""It's as if they were thirsting for school,"" said teacher Jacques Junior Mathieu. They have come a long way, said Farchi, who described the children as quiet and reserved the first time he saw them almost three weeks ago. They were afraid to stray far from their parents. They rarely smiled. ""First aid to the soul is no less important than physical wounds and may be much more difficult to attend,"" said Amos Radian, the Israeli ambassador to Haiti, visiting the school Wednesday. Radian said the Israelis plan to rebuild the collapsed school and construct a community center that will include a clinic and after-school program. The school bell clanged and the sound of laughter filled the air. Teacher Claire Marie Oculien stepped inside her classroom tent with a warmth she said she hasn't felt in a while. She chose this profession because she loves children. She returned to work as soon as she could, despite having lost her home and family members, because she wanted to do her part as a Haitian. ""Without education, there is no future for Haiti. These children are very courageous,"" she said after listening to some of their stories. One of her students, Vanessa Saint-Louis, said she was studying when the earth began to shake. The 9-year-old's mother died and her aunt takes care of her now. Then, she sat back down and rested her head on the shoulder of the girl next to her.","Haitians are receiving aid in form of water, food, but few have received counseling .

199,"(CNN) -- A BP estimate made after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon noted that as much as 100,000 barrels per day could leak into the ocean if the blowout preventer and wellhead were removed, a higher worst-case scenario than previously reported. According to an internal BP document released Sunday by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, BP believed that the worst-case scenario could be as high as 100,000 barrels, or 4.2 million gallons of oil per day. The figure is the highest yet to surface regarding the leaking oil well. At the disaster's outset, BP claimed the leak was about 1,000 barrels a day, a number it later revised to 5,000 and then much higher. BP told the House Energy and Commerce Committee that the worst-case scenario was 60,000 barrels (2.5 million gallons) a day, lower than what the document states. The document, submitted in May, maintains the 60,000 barrel estimate, but stipulates that if the ""blowout preventer and wellhead are removed and if we have incorrectly modeled the restrictions, the rate could be as high as 100,000 barrels a day."" Markey said the document ""raises very troubling questions about what BP knew and when they knew it."" ""It is clear that, from the beginning, BP has not been straightforward with the government or the American people about the true size of this spill,"" said Markey, the chairman of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""Considering what is now known about BP's problems with this well prior to the Deepwater Horizon explosion, including cementing issues, leaks in the blowout preventer and gas kicks, BP should have been more honest about the dangerous condition of the well bore,"" Markey said in a statement. BP spokesman Robert Wine said the May estimate cited in Markey's document is irrelevant to the current situation because the oil company has no intention of removing the well's blowout preventer. ""The allegation doesn't make sense,"" Wine told CNN. ""Why on earth would we remove the blowout preventer when it's sitting on top of the sea well and providing some control (of the spill)?"" Toby Odone, another spokesman for BP, added that the blowout preventer will be removed only when the well is completely killed. A blowout preventer is designed to seal off a well in the event of an emergency, but the device has not been working since the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon. Also Sunday, while cleanup crews and technical teams continued efforts to stop crude gushing into the Gulf, Louisiana lawmakers proposed a different approach: prayer. State senators designated Sunday as a day for citizens to ask for God's help dealing with the oil disaster. ""Thus far efforts made by mortals to try to solve the crisis have been to no avail,"" state Sen. Robert Adley said in a statement released after last week's unanimous vote for the day of prayer. ""It is clearly time for a miracle for us."" The resolution names Sunday as a statewide day of prayer in Louisiana and calls on people of all religions throughout the Gulf Coast ""to pray for an end to this environmental emergency, sparing us all from the destruction of both culture and livelihood."" Also Sunday, wildlife officials were planning to transport and release 40 pelicans that rescuers rehabilitated after finding them covered with oil. The birds will be moved from New Orleans, Louisiana, to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Port Aransas, Texas. As much as 60,000 barrels (2.5 million gallons) of oil may be gushing into the Gulf every day, new government estimates found last week. BP said it was able to capture roughly 8,480 barrels of oil from midnight to 12 p.m. Saturday. The company said it captured 24,500 barrels -- just over a million gallons -- of oil Friday, a little less than it captured the day before. BP said Saturday that it has paid $104 million to residents along the Gulf Coast who have filed claims related to the Gulf oil spill, issuing more than 31,000 checks in the past seven weeks. There was no immediate response from local, state or federal officials to BP's tally of its payments. Meanwhile, oil recovery efforts in the Gulf resumed Saturday morning on the drill ship Discoverer Enterprise, after work was suspended for about 10 hours because of a mechanical problem. A venting device aboard the drilling ship was not working properly, said Ayla Kelley, spokesperson for the Deepwater Horizon command center. Other recovery efforts continued during the time that the Discoverer Enterprise was idled, she said. She said the problem was with a blocked flame arrester, designed to prevent oil from combusting by extinguishing the flame.","NEW: BP calls worst-case estimate irrelevant .

200,"Minneapolis, Minnesota (CNN) -- Attorney Brian O'Neill has a lifetime of experience when it comes to the legal battles that ensue following major oil catastrophes. After the Exxon Valdez oil tanker crashed in Prince William Sound in 1989, O'Neill headed straight to Alaska. The Minnesota-based attorney had an interest in environmental issues and wanted to help because, as he put it, ""there were an awful lot of hurt people."" He soon represented 2,600 fishermen and others affected by the spill. What he thought would be a two- or three-year ""adventure"" is still the biggest thing on his plate, one-third of his life later. O'Neill successfully argued the 1994 trial after which a jury ordered Exxon to pay $5.3 billion in punitive damages to O'Neill's clients and others affected by the spill. Exxon appealed almost two dozen times and O'Neill was there through it all. In 2008, the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court, where a 5-3 majority finally set punitive damages at $500 million. It was a significant blow to O'Neill and his clients. Today, O'Neill is working to make sure each of his clients receives the remainder of their payments from Exxon, which he expects will be complete by year end. O'Neill spoke with CNN in his downtown Minneapolis office at the Faegre & Benson law firm about the similarities between the Exxon Valdez situation, and the current disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. CNN: What are some of the key similarities you see between the two spills? O'Neill: The noise and the feeling that you get now is the same as the noise and the feeling that you got in the early days of the Valdez spill, with people saying the same thing and people reacting the same way. It's going to be interesting when the limelight is no longer on the Gulf as to how BP is going to act and how the federal and state governments are going to act. Because once this is no longer on the front page of the newspaper, everybody's reaction is going to be 'We need oil.' Oil runs the universe, and you can see governments settling with BP relatively cheaply and you can see BP at some point in time changing its attitude from 'We'll pay you' to 'We'll pay you if the court tells us to pay you.' CNN: This week, BP agreed to set aside a $20 billion escrow account to compensate U.S. businesses and workers who have been adversely affected by the Gulf oil spill.  What are your thoughts on that? O'Neill: I hope what it means is that they're going to take $20 billion and set up a fund for victims and that you'll go to the fund and that they'll pay you interim money and then they'll pay you final money. That's my hope. And for a lot of the plaintiffs, they may not need to ever go to court, so they're not going to get tied up for 20 years. [In that regard] it would be really positive. If they're successful in starting to move money quickly, it'll be a huge success, but if they're going to pay anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 people, that's awfully tricky. And it's going to take a lot of work and a lot of money to set this thing up quickly, and it only works if you set it up quickly ... For a lot of these people who live from year to year on their fishing businesses, they could be bankrupt by the end of the year. So that's what we have to do is we've got to get money to them quickly. CNN: Did anything surprise you once you started representing the fishermen and taking on Exxon after the Valdez spill? O'Neill: I thought that -- like a lot of people think now with regard to BP -- that Exxon would want to settle the case relatively early and move on and I was surprised a number of times with the fact that this was World War III to them, and they dealt with it that way ... They spent over $400 million on lawyers, essentially defending [against] our claims. They took every appeal they could take and they took every delay they could take and filed every motion they could take. Don't kid yourself: the oil companies have the best lawyers money can buy. CNN: Is that one of the most important things you think people in the Gulf should keep in mind when thinking about filing a claim? O'Neill: I think that they should -- if they have a claim --file a claim with BP and see if BP will pay it. If BP doesn't pay it I think they ought to go to the federal oil spill fund and see if the oil spill fund will pay it, and then if they have to file suit with the knowledge that it's gonna be a long haul ... make absolutely sure they're not giving up any legal rights. The major problem they face other than the legal system is that they don't know how hard they've been hit yet. You could say to yourself, if you're a shrimper, 'Well I haven't fished for the last month.' But what happens if this toxic oil does something to that fishery? Or what happens if the presence of that toxic oil does something to the price of Gulf shrimp around the world? You're not going to know the answer to some of those things for two or three or four years. So you have to settle part of your case now if you can ... because the scope of the harm to you is unknown. It's as unknown as where that oil is going to go. CNN: You mentioned the legal system would be one of their biggest problems: can you elaborate on that? O'Neill: Well if a company is rich enough and powerful enough to hire hundreds of lawyers they can essentially bring the legal system to a halt. They can. Most of these fishermen no longer believe that the court system of the United States provides equal justice. They've come to a conclusion that is the same as the conclusion that I've come to, and that is that our governmental institutions will always bail out big oil, and they did here. CNN: Do you think oil still has that great of an influence today? O'Neill: It's more than the influence that oil has. It's whoever controls oil rules the world. The fact that you came downtown in a car that needs oil [and the fact that] the electricity in the office is probably the result of oil are everyday reminders of the strategic importance of oil to the United States, and if you're a judge or you're the president...you're aware of the fact that you need BP and Exxon, so why the heck would you punish BP or Exxon in any way that impairs their ability to survive? You wouldn't, no matter how many people they hurt. CNN: Do you have any regrets from this case? O'Neill: I regret that I haven't done a lot of other professional things for the last 21 years, I do. It was never my plan to be a trial lawyer until I was 63 years old. I was going to go off and do something else, teach law school probably. But I didn't get the chance to do that so that's my biggest regret. Second regret is it's hard on you emotionally, so then it's hard on your family to always be worrying about the same thing all of the time. But we got through it ... I am proud of the work I've done. I am not proud of the fact that I didn't make my clients whole. I had expected in 1989 that in the end of the day, everybody would be fully compensated for their losses, and they weren't. And that's in part my fault. So while I'm proud I lasted 21 years, the result was not what my clients deserved.","After the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, attorney Brian O'Neill headed to Alaska .

201,"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- The government of Myanmar said three bombs caused the deadly blasts that ripped through Yangon on Thursday, an action it calls a terrorist attack. At least 20 people have died and more than 70 others were wounded, a staff member at Yangon Hospital said. But the government says only eight have died and more than 90 others were wounded. The blasts occurred at 3 p.m. local time during a water festival, part of the New Year's celebration taking place in Myanmar and other southeastern Asian countries. People toss water on each other as part of a cleansing ritual during the celebration. Myanmar, formerly called Burma, is under strict military rule and such blasts are rare. Yangon, Myanmar's former capital and the country's commercial hub, is generally a crime-free and calm city.

202,"Paris, France (CNN) -- The death toll from flash flooding in southern France rose to 25 Thursday as rain continued to inundate the region, authorities said. Up to 20 millimeters (0.8 inches) of rain fell in some areas overnight, the Var prefecture said in a statement. Despite the additional rain, most of the flood waters have begun to recede and cleanup has begun. Some 104,000 homes were without electricity across the region, and 20,000 homes were without phone connections, the 10prefecture said. Rescue operations officially ended Thursday and authorities were focusing on the distribution of food and water,clearing debris and assisting residents of Draguignan, which was hardest hit, authorities said. The city is about 27 miles west of Cannes. Are you there? Send us your pictures or videos? Authorities warned residents not to drink water that appears or tastes unusual. They were distributing tens of thousands of bottles of water, along with meals, in the Draguignan area, the prefecture said. More local thunderstorms were forecast for Thursday afternoon and evening, the prefecture said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy was expected to visit the stricken areas next week, authorities said. The flooding, which began Tuesday, forced 2,000 people into shelters, officials said Thursday. Some 1,200 firefighters and 650 police officers have taken part in the rescue effort, the prefecture said. More than 1,400 people have been rescued by helicopter and 100 have been rescued by boat. The flooding also forced French authorities to transfer more than 400 inmates at Draguignan prison to other prisons in the south of France. Var includes the Cote d'Azur, a popular tourist destination along the French Riviera.

203,"(CNN) -- Officials in Panama City, Florida, have beaten construction delays, permit problems and the ever-present threat of hurricanes to arrive at this day: a new airport that will open the region to the world and bring in planeloads of tourism dollars. But as regular air service begins Sunday, authorities never thought they'd have to contend with a new threat: an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that continues to gush thousands of gallons of crude every day. ""We've been getting calls ever since the oil spill occurred,"" said Dan Rowe of the Panama City Visitors' Bureau. ""You know, wondering about their vacation plans."" Tourism, Rowe said, is the largest industry in Panama City. The $318-million Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport is the first international airport to open in the country since 1997. ""It is really going to be an economic driver for all of northwest Florida's economy for years to come,"" he said. The new airport is expected to generate approximately $80 million in new state revenues over the first 20 years of operation. But the challenge, now, is to convince tourists that the water is clean. ""We'll get through the oil spill,"" Rowe said. ""There's no oil on Panama City Beach or any of the beaches in northwest Florida."" Indeed, the spill is more than 100 miles away from Panama City Beach's coastline. Local officials have said that if it comes ashore, they will swiftly deal with it. Yet, beach towns across the Gulf coast have seen business slide precipitously as tar balls -- pieces of emulsified oil -- wash ashore along the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist asked oil company BP, which owns the damaged well at the heart of the slick, to pay for a $35 million advertising blitz to reassure tourists that Florida beaches remain untarnished by the spill. Oil has been gushing into the Gulf at the rate of about 5,000 barrels a day (210,000 gallons) since late April, when the drill rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 40 miles off Louisiana. Some estimates have put the amount of oil spewing from the well far higher. Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the explosion and sinking, and the cause has not been determined. Efforts to shut down the well that was ripped open by the accident have failed so far, though BP says it has been able to capture some of the escaping oil and pump it to a ship on the surface. The company also said it will continue using a controversial subsea dispersant to break up the plume of oil, pushing back against a directive from the Environmental Protection Agency to find a less toxic alternative, the EPA indicated Saturday. The EPA issued the directive on Thursday, ordering BP to find within 24 hours a less toxic but equally effective chemical than its current product, Corexit 9500, and one that is available in sufficient quantities. The directive also gave the company 72 hours to stop applying it to the undersea gusher. Corexit has been rated more toxic and less effective than many others on the list of 18 EPA-approved dispersants, according to testimony at a congressional hearing Wednesday. The EPA released BP's response to the mandate on Saturday. The response, which BP submitted late Thursday night, said that the oil company identified the only other effective, less toxic alternative available in mass quantities as Sea Brat 4. However, BP said the Sea Brat product ""contains a small amount of a chemical that may degrade to a nonylphenol."" Nonylphenol is an organic chemical that is toxic to aquatic life and may persist in the environment for years. Corexit, however, ""does not contain chemicals that degrade into NP (and) the manufacturer indicates that Corexit reaches its maximum bio-degradability within 28 days of application"" and does not persist in the environment, BP's response said. ""Based on the information that is available today, BP continues to believe that Corexit was the best and most appropriate choice at the time when the incident occurred, and that Corexit remains the best option for subsea application,"" BP said. Also Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will lead a bipartisan Senate delegation to inspect the Louisiana coastline after globs of thick, heavy oil began washing into some of the state's marshlands this week. The delegation will meet with federal officials and BP representatives to discuss the ongoing response efforts. CNN's Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","Florida Gov.

204,"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN)  -- Two members of the U.S. Olympic delegation -- both gold medalists from previous Olympics -- suffered minor injuries Sunday in an accident as they were traveling in Vice President Joe Biden's motorcade, the White House said. Peggy Fleming and Vonetta Flowers were taken to a hospital ""as a precaution"" after a van in the motorcade was involved in a minor accident, according to Biden spokesman Jay Carney. Both were later released from the hospital. Neither Biden nor anyone else in the motorcade was involved in the incident, Carney said. The statement did not provide further details about the accident. Fleming, a champion figure skater, won gold during the 1968 Grenoble, France, games. She was the only American to place first during those games, according to the International Olympic Committee Web site. Flowers earned gold in the 2002 Salt Lake City, Utah, Olympics in the two-person bobsled competition, according to the IOC.","Peggy Fleming, Vonetta Flowers in Vice President Biden's motorcade in Vancouver .

205,"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- Stephen and Sara Stone say they never thought their six-month marriage would be tested so soon. But on April 20, a day before her husband was scheduled to come home from a three-week stint on the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, Sara Stone found herself waiting to hear whether he was dead or alive. ""My phone call was that there's been an emergency evacuation on the rig,"" she said. She went back to their home in Houston, turned on the television ""and saw that the rig was on fire."" Stephen Stone, a laborer aboard the rig, was asleep in his room after working a 12-hour shift when an explosion erupted. He was one of the 115 workers rescued from the Gulf of Mexico -- but it would be more than a day before he was allowed to call his wife. Meanwhile, she was calling hospitals and praying her husband was still alive and unhurt. ""I finally was able to get a hold of an emergency response team, and they informed me that he was on the OK list,"" she said. ""And ... where they'd been taken to, which was a hotel in Kenner, Louisiana."" The night of the blast, Deepwater Horizon marked seven years without an accident. It burned for two days before sinking, taking 11 men into the deep with it and unleashing the worst oil spill in U.S. history. BP, which owns the well; Transocean, which owned the rig; and oilfield services contractor Halliburton, which performed the cementing on the well, all blame each other for the disaster. Transocean workers have told investigators that rig managers and a BP executive argued over plans to finish up the well, which was several weeks behind schedule. And Stone told the House Judiciary Committee in May that work on the rig had to stop at least four times because of a loss of drilling fluid in the well, which indicated either an unstable or cracked formation. Stone still works for Transocean. But he's filed suit against his employer, BP, Halliburton and other companies working on the doomed rig, alleging negligence. Transocean has not responded to the claims in court, but some of the other companies have denied the allegations. Stone said he always tried to be safe on the rig, even stopping work at times to call attention to safety issues. But there were consequences, he said. At one point, he said, he was called in for a talk with ""one of the senior guys for Transocean"" aboard the rig. ""They were saying my work performance had been slipping,"" Stone said. He said he told his bosses, ""I always thought I'd try to pace myself. You know, we're out here 12 hours, so you try to pace yourself and not wear yourself out. And think about what I'm doing and work safe. ""As soon as I was done saying that, they were like, 'Well, don't use safety as a crutch.' So, you know, you kind of get mixed signals."" As a roustabout, Stone's job involved assisting crane operators and mixing the ""mud"" used as a counterweight and lubricant in the drilling process. It was a ""bottom of the barrel"" job, an entry-level position at Transocean. But he said that the drill crew was under pressure to work faster and that pressure worked its way down the chain. ""I think everybody feels it, and especially the guys lower down, because I'm sure the toolpushers and whatnot are getting plenty of pressure from the people above them,"" he said. ""But you know, we're getting pressure from everybody, pretty much, down at the bottom."" Stone was awakened by the explosion. He said he ran outside to see the barrack spaces aboard the rig ""just all fire"" and the crew scrambling for the lifeboats. ""You can't see anything like that and not expect, you know, possibly to die. So you just kind of wait for it, you know?"" he said. He watched the rig burn for eight hours, first aboard a lifeboat and then aboard a supply ship that picked up the survivors. Back in Houston, Sara Stone took the first flight to New Orleans, Louisiana. Though told her husband was safe, she still hadn't heard from Stephen. ""The main question that all of us had was, are they really on that boat? Why can't we speak to them?"" she said. Stephen Stone was finally allowed to call his wife 26 hours after the explosion and after submitting to a drug test. He showed up at the hotel a few hours later. ""It started out as the worst day of my life, and it ended up as the best,"" Sara Stone said. ""I think we probably hugged each other for as long as we could."" Stone says he doesn't think he'll return to the offshore drilling business. But he said he did manage to salvage his most important possession before the rig sank: his wedding ring. ""This amazing person decided to go get his wedding ring from his room,"" his wife said. ""I mean, he just has kind of really blown my mind as far as who he is.""","Stephen Stone was to come home from oil rig April 21 .

206,"(CNN) -- These past six weeks, we've been thinking a lot about the ocean. But there's a deeper story than this one oil spill. Unfortunately the Deepwater Horizon disaster is a pretty typical example of the way we think about the ocean: We just don't worry about stuff that happens out there. The ocean covers 71 percent of the Earth's surface, and we hardly know anything about it. We humans are creating big problems because of what we don't know. We take fish from the ocean to eat without really knowing where they came from, or what they eat, or how many of them there are, or if we're maybe taking the last one. We dump whatever we like in the ocean and watch it float away -- to where? Who cares? The ocean is a massive, unexplored area of our planet, and in the U.S., we spend less on getting to know it than we spend on getting to know outer space. And our lack of attention is showing. Ocean fish are shrinking in size from year to year; coral reefs are being scraped away, and glorious ocean habitats are dying. But because it happens in the blank blue part of the globe, we don't hear about it or if we do, we don't pay attention. Watch the story of a woman who rowed the Pacific . So how can we get your attention on the ocean -- so we can start solving these problems we're creating? In April, we went on a trip to the Galápagos with 100 ocean scientists, activists and artists, filmmakers and musicians, to talk about what's going on in the ocean and what we can do to help. On the Mission Blue Voyage, we heard things and saw things that shocked us -- like Brian Skerry's picture of shrimp bycatch, the 8 pounds of dead sea creatures that are thrown away as garbage in order to catch 10 ounces of shrimp. Watch Skerry's talk about the glory and shame of the oceans . And we saw Jeremy Jackson describe a nearly lifeless ocean taken over by jellyfish. We also saw amazing things, thing that blew our minds -- like watching a bioluminescent jellyfish light up its mating display in the pitch-black deep ocean. We talked with some of the smartest people we've ever met, and we came up with some big plans for saving the ocean. But we came home from the trip still wondering -- will it make a difference? We're not scientists, but we know something we can do: encourage you to talk and think about the ocean, with hope that you will be more involved in the things that will make a difference. It's hard to think about having a role in saving something so overwhelmingly immense. But you can be a part of making things better. In fact, all of us have to. Here are some great places to start: . • Write a letter to your elected representative. Handwrite it; it makes a difference if you do. Let them know you support increased funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The more we learn about the ocean, the better we can protect it. If you live in Hawaii, thank your legislator for being part of the ban on sharkfin soup; if you live outside Hawaii, ask your state or county representatives why it hasn't been banned yet where you live. • If you're on Facebook, join the Mission Blue page or if you're on Twitter, follow @MissionBlue to keep up with ocean news. • Get one of those little responsible seafood guides, and use it. If you eat fish, tell your fish guy that sustainable fish is important to you, and not to sell you any more shrimp from overseas. And don't eat any more bluefin tuna or sharkfin soup. Did you know we killed 10 million sharks last year just for their fins?

207,"Osh, Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- Life in this embattled country's second-largest city appeared calm Tuesday even as concerns over the plight of refugees grew. The calm came as the Central Asian nation's news agency AKI Press reported that the death toll had risen to 176, a number that some observers discounted as low. A team of Red Cross doctors who visited Jalalabad's main hospital estimated the death toll at ""several hundred."" The streets of the southern city of Osh appeared deserted, except for a few pedestrians and army checkpoints. Stores, warehouses and shops were burned along miles of streets, which were patrolled armed police and soldiers. Near the airport, the most dangerous part of town, no one could be seen on the streets, which were quiet except for the sounds of sporadic gunfire. In Jalalabad, about an hour away, journalist Dalton Bennett accompanied Kyrgyz military through the streets Tuesday evening and told CNN that the military appeared to have imposed total control in the downtown area. Explainer: Kyrgyzstan's ethnic unrest . But, in the outskirts of town, sporadic gunfire and impromptu ""checkpoints"" continued, he said. About two-thirds of the downtown area had been looted and/or burned, with Uzbek-owned buildings appearing to have been the primary targets, he said. Buildings marked ""Kyrgyz"" appeared undamaged, he said. In recent days, more than 100,000 ethnic Uzbeks have fled the clashes with ethnic Kyrgyz, streaming into camps in neighboring Uzbekistan, according to Uzbekistan's Foreign Ministry. Thousands more have been denied passage into Uzbekistan because of a lack of resources. Many were standing on the Kyrgyz side of a barbed-wire fence. Three border crossings between Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan were open, Uzbekistan's Foreign Ministry said. One, at Yor Kishlok, Uzbekistan, remained closed. The closure came after throngs of people fleeing the violence overwhelmed refugee camps in Uzbekistan. Working together, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent Society of Kyrgyzstan have helped 16 medical facilities caring for more than 1,130 injured people in the past week, the ICRC said in a statement. Police said 15 officers have been killed. The United States and Germany have evacuated 89 people -- including 31 Americans and 40 Europeans -- from Osh, the German Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. They were taken to the capital, Bishkek, in the north. The United States is providing humanitarian assistance to the impoverished country and evaluating what further help may be needed, including military, a senior U.S. health official said in Washington. ""Right now our focus is humanitarian but it remains to be seen exactly what, if any, security assistance Kyrgystan needs,"" said the official, who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue. The official said the United States is not considering acting alone to provide any security assistance. The U.S. military said the interim Kyrgyz government has presented an official request for aid from the U.S. government beyond the $800,000 in humanitarian assistance already provided. U.S. officials were working with the provisional government to determine how best to distribute another $200,000 in medical and emergency supplies. The clashes are part of the most serious outbreak of ethnic violence in the former Soviet republic since 1990, when hundreds of people died in skirmishes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in Osh. It was not clear what sparked the violence, which came weeks after bloody protests removed Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiev from office. But it was clear that Tuesday's calm did not indicate an end to the crisis. ""This is far from over,"" said Anna Nelson, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, in a telephone call with CNN from Geneva, Switzerland. ""It's still extremely volatile. The needs are still extremely great."" Those Uzbeks who are most vulnerable are those who have had to remain in Kyrgyzstan, many of whom include orphans and the elderly, she said. For some, the situation is dire. ""Orphanages are running out of food,"" she said. Mosques and hospitals in Jalalabad are receiving large numbers of burn victims and people with gunshot wounds, she said. On Uzbekistan's side of the border, refugees were seeking shelter in parking lots and abandoned buildings, the ICRC said. As demand for water outpaced supply, some refugees were drinking from irrigation ditches, raising concern about outbreaks of diarrhea. Some analysts have said the clashes stem from resentment from minority Uzbeks that they have been under-represented in government positions and fears from ethnic Kyrgyz that Uzbeks in the country will help Uzbekistan invade Kyrgyzstan. Refugees were seeking help at bleak camps on the Kyrgyz border with Uzbekistan. ""People are screaming, 'We need food; we need food,' to those who are passing by,"" EU Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva said. But in the refugee camp in Yor Kishlock, there were ample supplies of food, tents, beds, sheets and blankets. The vast majority of the camp's occupants were female. They said the males had largely stayed behind to look after their homes. The United Nations said it was sending an emergency team to Uzbekistan to aid refugees who had crossed the border. U.N. Security Council President Claude Heller said the group condemns the ""continued acts of violence in the Kyrgyz Republic and notes the need to support the delivery of humanitarian assistance."" He said the council was assessing the situation in Kyrgyzstan and called for ""calm and a return to the rule of law"" in the country. In Osh, that calm did come Tuesday. But some wondered how long it would last. ""A pause before the unknown, and it's not clear if dark or light is ahead,"" said relief worker Will Lynch said.

208,"(CNN) -- Portugal winger Nani has been ruled out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with a collar bone injury. Nani, who plays for English premier League side Manchester United, suffered the injury in a training session with his national side in Portugal, before leaving for the tournament which begins on June 11. Nani's injury was not immediately levelheaded by coach Carlos Queiroz, but the Portuguese football association announced that the winger would not be taking part in the World Cup on their official Web site on Monday. ""After daily assessment of the evolution of the injury, including the carrying out of complementary exams, we have concluded that Nani was not able to compete,"" a statement read. Nani will be replaced in the squad by Benfica midfielder Ruben Amorin, ahead of Portugal's first match against Ivory Coast in Port Elizabeth on 15 June. With Nani watching from the stands, Portugal labored to a 3-0 victory Mozambique in their final warm-up game in Johannesburg on Tuesday. After a goalless first half, Danny collected a pass from Deco to open the scoring in the 51st minute, before striker Hugo Almeida came off the bench to score twice. Nani is the latest Premier League player to succumb to injury in the build-up to the finals. Chelsea duo Michael Essien of  Ghana and John Obi Mikel of Nigeria, and Manchester United's England Captain Rio Ferdinand, are also missing the showpiece. Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, who also plays for Premier League champions Chelsea, is a doubt for the tournament after breaking his arm in his team's friendly against Japan on Friday. Meanwhile, European champions Spain warmed up for South Africa in style with a 6-0 thrashing of Poland. Winger David Silva and striker David Villa made it 2-0 at half-time before Xabi Alonso added a third early in the second period. Cesc Fabregas and Fernando Torres both marked their returns from injury by coming off the bench to score and Pedro added a sixth ten minutes before full-time. But many people's World Cup favorites suffered an injury scare when Barcelona star Andres Iniesta limped off after 39 minutes with a thigh injury.

210,"(CNN) -- Slipknot bassist Paul Gray's death two months ago was from an accidental morphine overdose, the Polk County, Iowa, medical examiner said Monday. Gray, 38, was found dead by staff at a hotel near Des Moines, Iowa on May 24, said Sgt. Dave Disney of the Urbandale Police Department. Toxicology test results showed a fatal level of morphine and fentanyl -- a synthetic morphine -- in Gray's body, said Dr. Gregory Schmunk. Schmunk also noted the presence of significant heart disease, according to a police statement Monday. The autopsy did show that Gray had been dead for several hours before his body was found, Schmunk said. Grammy-winning metal band Slipknot -- whose fans are affectionately known as ""maggots"" -- was formed in Des Moines in late 1995 and became immediately recognizable for the dark and often grotesque homemade Halloween masks its nine members wore on stage. The band won a Grammy award in 2006 for best metal performance for ""Before I Forget."" Slipknot's self-titled debut album went platinum in 2000. Its fourth album, ""All Hope is Gone,"" spent 69 weeks on Billboard's Top 200 charts, debuting at No. 1 its first week in 2008. Gray was arrested in Iowa in 2003 on drug possession charges when police found small amounts of marijuana, two syringes and a substance that field-tested positive for cocaine after he was involved in a wreck with another motorist. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Autopsy showed morphine overdose killed Gray .

211,"New York (CNN) -- Those following the news of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may be surprised at how much is still unknown about the extent and movement of the oil, in particular below the sea surface, as engineers and scientists attempt to stanch the flow. More than five weeks after the oil rig disaster, and even with today's sophisticated technology, tracking and measuring the spill remains a huge challenge. Understanding fundamental difficulties with measuring in deep water helps explain why. Because oil is lighter than water, it tends to rise to the surface and form slicks that can be very damaging to the natural ecosystem, and ultimately the regional economy, as we are seeing now. Spraying chemical dispersants on the slick, as BP has, is one way to remove oil from the surface. The dispersants break the slick into small droplets, which are transferred down into the water column by waves and turbulence. BP has also injected dispersants into the oil plumes rising from the oil rig's broken plumbing on the seabed to try to prevent oil slicks from forming on the surface at all. This appears to have been at least partly successful in reducing the size of the surface slicks. The oil that does not reach the surface is dispersed through the water column by ocean currents. Instruments lowered from a research ship in the gulf have detected large oil plumes near the leak, more than 3,000 feet down. This is therefore the first spill where large plumes of oil have been observed spreading below the sea surface. While we have some understanding of how much oil is sitting at the surface and where it is heading, we have virtually no idea how much oil and dispersants are drifting below the surface of the gulf, nor do we know where these pollutants are going. It is notoriously difficult to take measurements at that depth. We can remotely survey large areas of the sea surface with planes and satellites but surveying the ocean's interior is vastly more difficult. Water blocks electromagnetic waves, such as light and radar, preventing us from imaging the deep. To map underwater concentrations of oil and dispersants, instruments need to be lowered into the plumes to take measurements and samples that are later analyzed in a lab. Close to the source, where oil-droplet concentrations are high, it may be possible to map the plumes using sound waves, but dissolved chemicals, such as dispersants, cannot be detected with such acoustic methods at all. In other words, we can ""see"" what is at the surface, but to find out what is going on beneath the waves, we need to put our ""feelers"" out. Decades of research on natural plumes, such as those rising from deep-water, hydrothermal hot springs on midocean ridges, and man-made plumes, such as sewage outfalls, have taught us that mapping subsurface plumes is time-consuming and costly. To put this into perspective, consider how hard it would be to map the ash cloud from the erupting volcano in Iceland if, instead of satellites, we were forced to use weather balloons. Near the source of the oil plumes in the gulf, the sampling problem is particularly severe because ""young"" plumes tend to be extremely patchy (the oil distribution is very uneven). Varying ocean currents, such as tides and eddies, move the plume patches around continuously and randomly, and cause the plumes to spread. This makes sampling both easier, because the plumes become less patchy and therefore harder to miss; and more difficult, because the plumes become more dilute and therefore harder to detect. With each passing day the problem gets worse as the oil spill's boundaries grow. In recent days, scientists began mapping the subsurface oil plumes by ship and using unmanned underwater robots (floats and gliders). Unfortunately, these plume surveys are unlikely to produce a reliable estimate of the amount of oil dispersing through the gulf, especially since much of the oil may already be too dilute to detect. To determine the extent of the oil spill, we will need to combine measurements with computer modeling. But even a perfect model cannot make valid predictions if the data are wrong. Therefore, it is crucial that the amount of oil leaking into the gulf be estimated accurately. I am hopeful that the recently formed ""Flow Rate Technical Group,"" a multi-agency team that includes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will be able to carry out this task with minimal outside interference. It is equally important, however, to continue to collect data on the circulation in the gulf over the full water depth to validate and improve the realism of models for this spill. And monitoring the circulation should continue even after the oil leak has been stopped, until the oil has dispersed sufficiently so as not to pose any further biological risk. In this way, we will have a better idea of the full environmental impact of this incident. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andreas Thurnherr.","Andreas Thurnherr says it may surprise that much still unknown about spill's flow in deep sea .

212,"Palisades, New York (CNN) -- About six weeks ago, a large earthquake devastated Haiti and killed over 200,000 people. Saturday, a huge earthquake releasing 500 times more energy, devastated Chile and killed hundreds. So why did the smaller earthquake kill so many more people? And why the sudden spate of disastrous earthquakes in the Americas? No, the apocalypse is not coming. No, the two earthquakes are not linked in any way. And no, Pat Robertson, you can't blame the Devil or the French. The real answers, for those comfortable with science and the Enlightenment, are tectonics and poverty. Of the many revolutions of the 1960s, the one that really mattered to geologists was the revolution of plate tectonics. Tectonics is the word geologists use to describe the process by which mountains move and rocks squeeze and crunch. In the sixties, new data from research cruises and from earthquake seismometers led to the realization that tectonics makes mountains slide sideways long distances. Earth scientists discovered that the Earth has a patchy skin of mobile plates a hundred miles thick and thousands of miles across, and that they move horizontally at a slow but irresistible pace. It's where they collide that our problems begin. South America is a prime example of this process, one that geologists call ""subduction."" It's why we have the long chain of mountains called the Andes and it's why countries like Chile and Peru suffer giant, destructive earthquakes every few decades. Off the coast of Chile is a tectonic plate called the Nazca Plate. Unseen by most, it has been inching its way towards the South American continent, and sliding underneath it, for well over a hundred million years. Since the day that Magellan first rounded Tierra del Fuego it has encroached by 130 feet in a roughly east-north-east direction. The Nazca plate doesn't slide under the South American plate in an orderly fashion though. It moves in fits and starts, sometimes sticking and sometimes slipping, sometimes here and sometimes there. Along the coast of Chile, patches can get stuck for over a hundred years. When they do finally slip, they go with a bang. All that squeezing energy is released in seconds and an earthquake happens. On Saturday a patch roughly the size of Maryland came unstuck, unleashing one of the most powerful tremors ever recorded. Fifty years ago, a patch four times bigger and with an area of about 50,000 square miles, the size of Louisiana, slipped and triggered the Valdivia earthquake. Its magnitude has been estimated as at least 9.5, making it the largest earthquake of modern times. Over millions of years, this tectonic squeezing has formed the Andes and raised the high desert known as the Altiplano. Elsewhere it has created the Alps, the Rockies, the Himalayas, and Tibet. It has also created and distorted some of the islands of the Caribbean, including Haiti. So that's why some parts of the world suffer from big earthquakes that strike with irregular frequency, while other regions are seismically quiet: it all depends on where the plates meet and how fast they are running into each other. Knowing this helps us assess seismic risk and mitigate it. It helps us know where the strongest earthquake shaking will hit and roughly how often. Predicting when the shaking will hit is a much greater challenge, and geophysicists are working hard to reach that goal. In any case, prediction is not the real problem: poverty is. Poverty is what ultimately kills most people during an earthquake. Poverty means that little or no evaluation is made of seismic risk in constructing buildings and no zoning takes place. It means that building codes are not written, and even if they do exist they are difficult, or impossible, to enforce. It means the choice between building robustly or building cheaply is not a choice at all. Haiti is a tragic illustration of this. Weak building materials and poor construction standards share much of the blame for the grotesque numbers of fatalities, injured and internally displaced people. Of course it's complicated. Earthquake shaking is a complex process and the chain of causation from earthquake source magnitude through infrastructural damage to human harm involves factors like the type of earthquake fault, its orientation, the hardness of bedrock or presence of wet soil, and so on. A lot also depends on the time of day the earthquake strikes in terms of how many people are inside buildings that could collapse. Population density, distance from the epicenter, and the depth of the rupture are the most important factors of all. Nevertheless, those countries most at risk of seismic tragedy are not simply those on tectonic plate boundaries, but also those with the least money to spend on protecting themselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Colin Stark.","Chile's quake released 500 times more energy than Haiti's, says Colin Stark .
Earthquake's magnitude is related to movement of plates on earth's surface, Stark says .
Quake damage partly due to level of poverty, quality of building techniques, he says .",51542 68 417 122 44 243 306 234 1 487 5795 2219 9649 3 329 56 856 125 62 430 1 573 5795 4731 739 197 45 1387 2219 6271 3 329 767 59 271 116 0 2147 5795 1178 59 106 45 62 3 271 0 3323 8995 5 6251 12435 4 0 12188 61 0 18075 10 26 439 61 0 51 12435 28 26 1417 4 100 114 3 61 5918 7779 78 57 47 2059 0 8281 50 0 1115 0 386 3121 6 118 2247 9 1834 3 0 30143 28 52453 3 3674 5 0 106 21109 5 0 4005 0 35 11 204 14299 2 25677 14 0 3509 5 4692 52453 52453 10 0 1324 25677 244 2 2510 0 660 15 38 3755 334 3 4334 7323 3 9629 4 0 12532 68 1247 17 721 13965 3 17 5795 104144 391 2 0 17938 11 52453 563 3755 6711 16299 188 9931 1746 1696 742 11 0 1746 20 1 18679 1973 5 1543 6868 1 3361 675 3702 3 574 5 675 261 3 11 30 334 26744 12 1 2340 18 18427 2921 13 7 81 30 17940 11 110 619 1335 330 636 10 1 798 959 5 24 660 35 11 25677 387 74863 13 7 271 43 19 0 188 2735 5 3755 149 0 24382 3 13 7 271 752 84 6271 3 8736 2372 1443 8574 12435 195 218 1126 99 0 1241 5 6271 10 1 29675 4692 149 0 75971 4692 12533 15 96 13 20 29 30456 86 114 842 0 330 356 4799 3 8824 4595 13 6 124 56 1 3361 298 75 105 0 108 11 50391 69 7175 49690 5008 48067 13 20 43999 15 4831 942 4 1 2925 289361 2130 0 75971 4692 433 47 6711 140 0 330 356 4692 4 23 17145 1737 315 13 2533 4 6537 3 2323 922 5650 3 922 8224 922 190 3 922 48 337 0 1241 5 6271 10720 57 94 2268 6 56 1 3361 75 36 30 89 766 4800 30 130 9 1 5790 49 11 15049 1387 10 345 4 1782 3 23 5795 1783 8 430 1 6681 2925 0 1310 5 4175 167 35421 17490 35 5 0 96 1370 21765 302 1683 9081 75 234 1 6681 156 197 1890 3 9 23 314 5 44 464 125 1721 675 0 1310 5 5104 4379 3 3786 0 64337 5795 86 8000 20 29 1299 16 12 296 562 280 257 13 0 1080 5795 5 1500 197 56 1042 5 75 24 29675 15049 20 2719 0 24382 3 835 0 220 4200 241 16 0 79156 2092 13 20 810 0 11430 0 22155 0 22733 3 18310 13 20 41 810 3 14587 76 5 0 3733 5 0 5055 129 9649 59 11 7 271 76 1001 5 0 115 2372 17 269 12435 11 1627 9 14054 8660 77 66 3747 28 64995 2216 13 49 5542 8 81 0 6868 782 3 97 1414 30 28 647 54 236 66 2117 24 2118 152 5135 15494 694 3 14513 13 13 2118 152 143 81 0 5279 5795 5152 42 327 3 2925 97 398 8509 36 0 5152 42 327 10 1 133 1323 976 3 86777 28 277 393 2 894 11 827 4 100 229 10359 10 26 0 386 589 3674 10 3674 10 64 1979 7069 96 62 93 23 5795 3674 547 11 231 50 61 7465 10 90 5 15494 694 4 17890 2277 3 61 29885 729 176 13 547 11 715 10087 28 26 1062 3 101 63 30 89 3441 30 28 556 50 2084 2 7245 13 547 0 1259 136 715 25735 50 715 17219 10 26 1 1259 12 49 9649 10 1 1518 10583 5 24 3529 715 3400 3 1060 2585 1822 877 133 5 0 2059 6 0 16074 1205 5 8317 881 3 11297 6254 62 5 540 13 7 3763 5795 5152 10 1 1732 660 3 0 2735 5 49783 17 5795 910 8000 112 74166 1005 2 630 2065 3500 3202 84 0 1380 5 5795 3700 86 8537 0 64789 5 19303 50 1814 5 4347 4056 3 59 8 1 276 41 5542 8 0 53 5 108 0 5795 3152 4 969 5 97 106 62 28 454 2277 11 72 3573 1390 13357 2281 17 0 14702 3 0 5539 5 0 21029 28 0 96 428 3202 5 49 5879 118 752 96 12 694 5 15494 1649 28 26 789 118 8 29675 4692 6899 18 41 118 9 0 296 321 2 1052 8 3358 612 0 2085 1101 4 24 2432 28 2180 118 5 5928 5203,5d89f145eb12a37970869c33f76e107b8d7903ac,
213,"(CNN) -- Fueled by hot, dry conditions, a wildfire near Flagstaff in northern Arizona grew to 10,000 acres, city officials said late Monday. The blaze spread so quickly, it caught some locals off guard.  Flagstaff city spokeswoman Kimberly Ott said the source of the fire was an abandoned campfire. The Schultz Fire ignited late Sunday morning, shutting down part of U.S. Route 89 and causing the Coconino County  Sheriff's Office to evacuate at least 748 properties, including two residential neighborhoods, an animal shelter and the Sunset Crater and Wupatki National Monuments. The sheriff's office is recommending that nearby residents put together evacuation kits. ""It's something that unless you've lived through it, I don't think you can imagine,"" evacuee Patti Vorhees told CNN affiliate KTVK as she packed up her pets and left. ""You literally take your prescriptions, your animals and the clothes on your back."" The Red Cross has set up a shelter at Mount Elden Middle School in Flagstaff. The Coconino County website says the U.S. Forest Service and several fire departments responded with about 300 firefighters, eight air tankers and five helicopters to put out the blaze. A Type One Incident Management Team also was sent to the scene. The U.S. Fire Administration website says that's a self-contained team of 35 to 50 highly trained personnel deployed to manage incidents of ""national significance."" High winds in the area Sunday didn't help. The winds both stoked the flames and caused emergency crews to ground the air tankers for 5 1/2 hours Sunday afternoon. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said gusty southwesterly winds, from 20 to 30 mph, will blow through the area through Tuesday, then calm by Wednesday morning. There's a slight chance of showers and thunderstorms in the area beginning on Thursday, Morris said. Government fire spokesman Eric Neitzel told CNN affiliate KPHO that higher humidity and lower temperatures overnight allowed firefighters to ""make some good progress on the line"" and protect structures. KTVK's website, www.azfamily.com, says authorities shut down part of Highway 89 Sunday because of visibility issues, as the Schultz Fire was producing a huge plume of smoke that could be seen for miles. But by Monday morning, Neitzel told KPHO the cooperative overnight weather, including calmer winds, were making the smoke ""[lay] down ... so you don't see the big tower of smoke."" The Schultz Fire was the second large wildfire to break out in the Flagstaff area this weekend. The Hardy Fire started early Saturday afternoon. But the Hardy Fire is much smaller, at 300 acres, and firefighters have been able to contain 30 percent of it. The Flagstaff Fire Department initially had ordered evacuations of two neighborhoods and the Cococino Humane Society because of the Hardy Fire, but those evacuation orders have been rescinded, said the Coconino County website.","NEW:  10,000 acres burned in northern Arizona .

214,"London, England (CNN) -- Fashion designer Alexander McQueen hanged himself in his wardrobe and left a suicide note, a coroner told a London inquest Wednesday. McQueen, 40, was found dead at his London apartment Thursday. The cause of death was asphyxia and hanging, said coroner's officer Lynda Martindill. A police officer told the inquest that McQueen's death was ""nonsuspicious,"" according to Martindill. ""The coroner said a note had been found and is being looked at by the police,"" Martindill said, without offering details about the note. The coroner adjourned the inquest until April 28 in order to complete the full post-mortem report, she said. McQueen, who had dressed stars from Sarah Jessica Parker and Nicole Kidman to Rihanna and Sandra Bullock, killed himself nine days after the death of his mother. He expressed his devastation at her death on his Twitter account days before he died. McQueen, whose real name was Lee Alexander McQueen, had a reputation for controversy that earned him the titles ""enfant terrible"" and ""the hooligan of English fashion."" British Vogue Editor Alexandra Shulman called him a ""modern-day genius."" ""His brilliant imagination knew no bounds,"" she said after his death. Eccentric singer Lady Gaga, who called herself a big fan and wore McQueen's alien-inspired stilettos in a recent video, dedicated her performance at Tuesday night's BRIT Awards in London to the designer. McQueen was born in 1970 in London's East End, the son of a taxi driver, according to a biography on the Vogue Web site. He trained in London's Savile Row at a company that made suits for Prince Charles. One anecdote that helped cement his bad-boy image was that he had once embroidered a suit for the Prince of Wales with a profanity sewn into the lining. His clothing line was purchased in 1991 by stylist Isabella Blow, who became a close friend. She committed suicide in 2007, five years after his label was brought into the Gucci Group, based in Paris, France. In an interview with CNN's Jim Bittermann in October, McQueen spoke of the changing nature of runway shows for fashion designers. His latest show was an invitation event for 1,000 people, and was streamed live on the Internet. ""It's got to progress and it's got to move on,"" he said. ""I've been doing these shows for over 15 years now; I must have done about 60 shows. Even I get bored with the same concept, so this way, I can see a brighter future for fashion."" The designer was honored as a commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003, and won numerous other awards in the fashion world.","Coroner tells inquest designer left note and hanged himself .

215,"New York (CNN) -- More than 1,000 people in New Jersey and New York, many of them adolescent Orthodox Jews, have been sickened with mumps since August, health authorities said Monday. Orange County, New York, has confirmed 494 cases since early November, county spokesman Richard Mayfield told CNN. Almost all of those infected with the virus are of the Orthodox or Hasidic Jewish population, and their average age is 14, he said. Neighboring Rockland County has confirmed 317 cases since August, with all of the sick from the Orthodox Jewish community, said Kathleen Henry, county Deputy Commissioner of Health. Their average is 14 to 18, she said. Just south of the two counties, in New York City, Brooklyn had 79 confirmed cases of mumps as of October 30, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in November. Any confirmation of other infections in the city are expected to be announced Tuesday. The mumps outbreak began at a summer camp for Orthodox Jewish boys in Sullivan County, New York, according to the CDC. Health officials have linked the outbreak to an 11-year-old boy at the camp. He had recently returned from the United Kingdom, where a mumps outbreak had spread to 4,000 people. The mumps outbreak also spread to Ocean County, New Jersey, where 159 confirmed cases have been diagnosed since September, county spokeswoman Leslie Terjesen told CNN. An additional 70 others are suspected of having mumps, she said. Only seven of the infected are not Orthodox Jewish, but they all had exposure to the community, Terjesen said. The average age of the sick is 21, she said. Lakewood, New Jersey, Rabbi Yehunda Pirutinsky was surprised when his 14-year-old son was diagnosed with mumps a week ago. Lakewood is in Ocean County. ""He was completely vaccinated,"" Pirutinsky said. ""So it was a surprise to us he came down with mumps."" Anyone fully vaccinated from mumps receives two doses of the vaccine, according to the CDC. Of the New Jersey cases, 77 percent were vaccinated, Terjesen said. But the vaccine is not 100 percent effective, according to the CDC. At two doses, the vaccine is 76 to 95 percent effective, the CDC says on its Web site. In November, the CDC called the spike in mumps cases, ""the largest U.S. mumps outbreak since 2006, when the United States experienced a resurgence of mumps with 6,584 reported cases."" Then, only 179 people were sickened in New York and New Jersey. Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus, according to the CDC. Initial symptoms appear 12 to 25 days after infection and include fever, headache, muscle aches and loss of appetite. Mumps can cause the jaw and cheeks to swell, with further complications including the inflammation of the brain, testicles or ovaries, and deafness, according to the CDC. Pirutinsky's son has fully recovered from his bout with mumps, which Pirutinsky assumes he contracted while at his Jewish high school. A doctor advised the teenager to not attend school for a week and limit time with his siblings, Pirutinsky said. The outbreak has disproportionately affected Orthodox Jewish communities, but Pirutinsky said he wasn't overly worried. ""I wouldn't say the community is alarmed, but it's something we're aware of,"" he said. CNN's Edmund DeMarche, Miriam Falco and Nicole Bliman contributed to this report.","Almost all the cases of mumps involve adolescent Orthodox Jews .

216,"(CNN) -- A fast-developing storm spawned at least one tornado Sunday in Billings, Montana, ripping the roof off a massive entertainment complex and causing extensive damage in the region. No injuries were reported. Amateur video shows the funnel cloud hovering over the MetraPark venue -- home to a sports arena, expo center and other facilities -- kicking up debris and peeling away the roof of one of the complex's buildings. Gov. Brian Schweitzer estimated that the roof damage could cost between $8 million and $15 million, but noted it was fortunate the arena was not hosting an event when the twister struck around 4:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET). The damaged building held a football game at the same time just a night earlier, he said. Meteorologist Keith Meier of the National Weather Service in Billings estimated the tornado to be as strong as an EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds estimated at more than 100 mph. Meier said the storm also produced quarter- to half-dollar-sized hail. Schweitzer plans to travel to the region Monday to survey the damage; he said the National Guard is ready to assist in cleanup efforts if needed.

217,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Large and small donations flowed in Monday evening as dozens of celebrities answered phones for Larry King's telethon to help the people of the U.S. Gulf Coast suffering from the oil disaster. ""A hundred dollars? Wow! Thanks you so much,"" rocker Tyson Ritter told one donor who called in. The two-hour CNN show raised more than $1.81 million, with proceeds going to three charities deeply involved in the efforts to help humans, wildlife and the environment. ""Everyone's really pissed off,"" actress Jenny McCarthy, who was monitoring online messages in the telethon's ""Tweet Suite,"" told host Ryan Seacrest. Donors could choose to send their money to the United Way, National Wildlife Federation or The Nature Conservancy. Celebrity journalist Giuliana Rancic said she was on the phone with ""Barbara"" from Kokomo, Indiana. ""She's saying it's the animals,"" Rancic said. Actress Victoria Principal sat next to her on another call. ""We're just talking about the wildlife,"" Principal said. Singer Aaron Neville, a New Orleans native, said most of the calls he answered in New York were from people concerned about animals impacted by the oil. ""People are crying on the phone and giving money,"" Neville said. Actor Ted Danson said it was important for him to ""hear people's emotions, their fear and sadness"" when they called in donations, . CNN correspondents reported live from the Gulf Coast, interviewing people whose lives have been interrupted by the oil disaster. ""The toughest thing I see is losing a way of life that we've had down here for generations and generations,"" said shrimper Archie Dantin in Pointe a la Hache, Louisiana. A BP spokesman issued a statement Monday saying the oil company is ""proceeding with urgency to make the situation right for the environment and for those who have affected by this tragic event."" ""We stated from the beginning that we accept responsibility for cleaning up the spill and for paying all legitimate claims for those directly impacted financially by this environmental disaster,"" BP's statement said. The company said over 65,000 claims have been submitted and more than 32,000 payments have been made, totaling more than $107 million. ""The average time from filing a claim to checks being issued is only a few days,"" BP siad. ""Even for more complex business claims that have provided supporting documentation."" ""I don't think they're responding fast enough,"" shrimper Keillen Williams said. Retired NBA star Jalen Rose, who was helping answered phones at CNN's Los Angeles bureau, said he is sure President Barack Obama will make BP pay. ""But it will take time for that to happen, so we're here today to provide immediate relief to those in need,"" Rose said.","NEW:  Larry King telethon for Gulf raises more than $1.8 million .

218,"(CNN) -- The bodies of young elephants covered in the brown dirt of dried-up wells tell a heartrending story. A baby elephant in the Gourma region of central Mali had been trapped in a well for three days. Reaching desperately for drops of water, they had lowered their trunks, toppled in, remained trapped and died in Mali's scorching heat. The ""last desert elephants in West Africa"" have ""adapted to survive in the harsh conditions"" they face, Save the Elephants said Monday. But now, the group says, conditions have gone from bad to worse, and they are living ""on the margin of what is ecologically viable."" Save the Elephants distributed new pictures Monday that depict the devastating drought and the struggle for survival in Mali, one of the poorest nations in the world. ""Six elephants have already been found dead,"" the group wrote in a news release accompanying the photos. ""Four others, including three calves, were recently extracted from a shallow well into which they had fallen when searching for water. Only the largest survived."" The youngest are in the most danger, since their smaller trunks can't reach deep into the few remaining wells, the group said. The worst drought in 26 years is threatening the existence of the ""last desert elephants in West Africa,"" the northernmost herds in the continent, Save the Elephants said. The animals, now numbering only about 350 to 450, have been called ""the last elephants of Timbuktu,"" said Jake Wall, a scientist with Save the Elephants. But they're south of Timbuktu, Wall told CNN in a phone interview from Bamako, Mali. ""We tend to refer to them as 'the last Sahelian elephants.' ""  See a map of Mali » . Each year, the elephants trek farther on the fringes of the Sahara to find water. They have the longest migration route of any in the continent, traveling ""in a counterclockwise circle"" of about 700 kilometers (435 miles), Save the Elephants said. The images are signs of the crisis gripping the northwest African nation. The U.N. Development Programme ranks Mali near the bottom of its Human Development Index. It cites a 56 percent poverty rate in the country, with nearly a third of the population unlikely to live past age 40, and an illiteracy rate of 77 percent. The World Food Programme says the majority of infant deaths in Mali are due to malnutrition. The drought, combined with soaring temperatures, has also led to deaths of cattle, Save the Elephants said. ""The stench of rotting corpses fills the air, and what little water remains is putrid and undrinkable by all standards."" In areas where the elephants live and search for water, ""the normal peaceful coexistence between the elephants and herdsmen is starting to break down and giving way to conflict over access to water,"" Wall said. There is some hope for the weeks and months ahead. ""We're hoping the rains start in June, and that will allow the elephants to start drinking out of shallow ponds until the really heavy rains begin"" in July or August, Wall said. But ""urgent action"" is needed in the interim ""to secure water for the elephants,"" Wall's group said in its news release. Save the Elephants, which focuses on helping elephant populations worldwide, said it has partnered with a foundation and the Mali government in its fundraising appeal.","Elephants dying in Mali are among 350 to 450 left in the area .

219,"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian security forces blamed a privately owned vehicle Thursday for allegedly running into protesters during Sunday's opposition protests on a Shiite Muslim holy day, according to a news agency. ""There were no deaths resulting from a car accident in the Vali-e Asr area. We referred to the fact in our previous statement that a privately owned Patrol vehicle hit a number of rioters on Azadi [Freedom] Street between Roudaki and Khosh Streets,"" said the semi-official Iranian Labour News Agency, referring to a model of car made by Nissan. ""The vehicle was traced by the security forces and the case is being investigated,"" ILNA said. At least seven people were killed Sunday -- the Shiite Muslim holy day Ashura -- as anti-government protests turned violent. The Iranian government denies that any of the deaths were caused by official security forces, but the clashes -- depicted in sometimes grainy and shaky amateur videos -- show a number of protesters with serious and possibly fatal injuries, including some with apparent gunshot wounds. In one video -- shot Sunday, according to the posting on the Web site YouTube -- green-and-white police trucks rush into crowds of demonstrators in Tehran. The protesters scatter in all directions, but one truck drives into a group trapped in a narrow street with a wall on one side and parked cars on the other. The camera follows the truck, which appears to be a police truck, as it backs away, but a person briefly can be seen crumpled in the street where the truck had been. When the camera returns to the spot, another truck drives over the person. Other protesters rush to the downed person's aid. It is not clear whether the person was killed. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the video, or another one obtained by CNN that shows a woman who was said to have been killed when hit by a car driven by members of the Basij, the Iranian paramilitary group. ILNA said it released the statement Thursday from security forces ""owing to the fact that a film has been shown by foreign and anti-revolution [news] networks regarding a vehicle similar to those used by Security Forces being involved in hitting a man at the Vali-e Asr Square."" ""Since the film may be a fake, which is the way foreign and anti-revolution media work, the case is being investigated."" Iran's chief prosecutor, Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, told reporters this week that seven people where killed in Sunday's clashes on the holiday of Ashura. Most died after being struck with ""hard objects or due to similar causes,"" Dolatabadi said. Opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi's nephew, Seyyed Ali Moussavi, died from a gunshot wound on Sunday. The elder Moussavi's Web site said he was killed during the demonstrations, but state-run news agencies said that Moussavi's death was not connected to the Ashura protests but ""had been planned in suspicious circumstances."" Sunday's clashes were the worst since opposition protesters took to the streets for days following the disputed June 12 presidential election. At least eight people were killed during those protests. Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, who was killed in battle in Karbala in 680 A.D.

220,"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (CNN) -- The sight of a baby girl suckling on the breast of her dead mother changed the course of Abebech Gobena's life forever. The year was 1980 and Ethiopia lay in the grip of what would become one of the most devastating famines in its history. Gobena, a devout Christian, was on a pilgrimage to a holy site in the north-east region of the country when she came across the dead mother and her baby, lying amid a sea of people who were starving to death. ""When I was returning, there were so many of these hungry people sprawled all over, you could not even walk,"" Gobena told CNN. ""I had some bread on me, so I tried to feed them. I fed two men. When I reached this woman, she was dead, but the child was still suckling at her breast,"" she continued. ""One of the chauffeurs charged with picking up the corpses said to me, 'I am waiting for the child to die so I can pick up both bodies. I just can't bear to take the child as well while she is still alive,'"" Gobena said. Without a second thought, Gobena bundled the tiny girl into her arms and smuggled her to the country's capital, Addis Ababa. In that instant, she transformed both the baby's future and her own. Haunted by the images of the dying people, it wasn't long before Gobena headed back to the countryside in an effort to source water for the destitute locals. She came across another child in the arms of his dying father. Find out more about Gobena and her orphanage. Gobena told CNN: ""At the end of the day, as we were going home we came upon five people, three of them dead, two alive. One of the men dying by the side of the road said to me, 'This is my child. She is dying. I am dying. Please save my child.'"" Gobena took the baby boy home which posed a threat to her own safety, she explained to CNN. ""It was a terrible famine. There were no authorities. The government at that time did not want the famine to be public knowledge. So I had to pretend the children were mine and smuggle them out."" By the end of 1980, Gobena had taken in 21 children. But her desire to save the young children caused friction in her family. ""My family, my husband gave me an ultimatum, choose the children or choose your life,"" she told CNN. ""My relatives, even my mother said, 'She has gone mad, she should be checked at the mental institution.'"" Gobena continued: ""I was not welcome at home. So I decided to move to some land I had bought with the intention of raising some chicken. I moved into this forest area with the kids."" Thirty years on and Gobena, now more famously known as ""Africa's Mother Theresa,"" is the founder of Ethiopia's oldest orphanage. Gobena's thirty-year legacy means she has raised a generation of Ethiopia's abandoned children, orphaned by the ravages of famine, war and HIV/AIDS. However, leaving her own family was a tough decision for Gobena, who had struggled since childhood to gain an education, job and secure family life. Born in 1938, she was only a month-old when her father was killed during the Ethio-Italian war. As tradition dictated, she was brought up by her father's parents until the age of 11, when she was married off without her consent. Revolting against her marriage, Gobena ran away from home to Addis Ababa, where she scraped a basic education, gained a job as a quality controller and remarried. She told CNN: ""I suffered because of the traditions of the country I was born in. But things have improved. My goal is not to marry them off, but to raise them as adults who can take care of themselves."" Gobena has come a long way since 1980 when she struggled to survive, resorting to selling her possessions and tearing up her own dresses to make clothes for the infants. Now her orphanage, as well as sheltering, also acts as a school, educating over 700 children. But she says: ""I have no regrets. God has helped me get to this point. I always had great faith in God. ""I knew we would survive, even selling small things by the roadside. I am so happy because none of the children died, and all of them grew up.""","Abebech Gobena is the founder of Ethiopia's first orphanage .

221,"(CNN) -- Severe weather took only about five minutes to knock out windows and rip signs and awnings off buildings in downtown Bridgeport, Connecticut, Thursday afternoon, eyewitness Beth Bowman reported. ""In seconds it just turned black, and you can't see across the street. There was foggy, crazy hard rain,"" said Bowman, who was in a downtown bookstore in Bridgeport when the severe weather barreled through. After five minutes of darkness, the weather cleared and the sun came out, Bowman said. The damage from the brief but powerful storm included uprooted trees and overturned U.S. postal boxes, she said. Mayor Bill Finch said via Twitter that his city was under a state of emergency. Weather data showed winds up to 75 mph, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. It was not immediately clear if the winds were from a tornado or strong thunderstorm, he said. But the National Weather Service characterized the event as a thunderstorm. It reported wind damage that included ""extensive tree damage."" The Bridgeport Police Department said the storm caused significant damage.

222,"(CNN) -- The oil spill on the Gulf Coast has states and visitors bureaus working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . Oil has affected sections of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key beaches, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Photos from the area showed patches of dark, syrup-like oil on the white sand. A health advisory has been issued by Escambia County for parts of Pensacola Beach and Fort Pickens, CNN's Rich Phillips reported. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . The beaches in Fort Walton Beach, Destin and Okaloosa Island are open to the public, and the air quality is good, according to the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, which represents the three destinations. ""Depending on the wind direction, tar balls may float ashore in Destin or Ft. Walton Beach later in the week, but cleaning crews are standing by,"" the bureau's website said. Small to moderate-size tar balls continue to wash up on some beaches of south Walton County, but the impact has been isolated, and all 15 beach communities remain open, according to the Walton County Tourist Development Council's website. Meanwhile, small scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach, but the beaches are open and the swimming is still safe, the area's visitors bureau website said. ""Our sugary white sand beaches are open for the enjoyment of our guests and, as of now, we are seeing only intermittent impact,"" according to the bureau. iReport: A slick trip to Perdido Key . Last week, the Escambia County Health Department rescinded a health advisory that had been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama border to the entrance of the Perdido Unit of the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Government officials said that there was no oil sheen or oil slick observed in the water from the high-water mark out to 100 yards from shore. Dime-size to 5-inch tar balls continue to wash up in widely scattered areas of northwest Florida, but all of the state's beaches remain open, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. But several spots have been affected by the oil spill. On Santa Rosa Island, crews cleaned up when light mousse -- a frothy oil-water mixture -- made landfall. Significant tar balls washed ashore near Opal Beach. ""Response efforts include the constant surveillance for oil on the water,"" the website said. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""The beaches are open and visitors are still welcome to sunbathe and walk the beach, but we strongly suggest they swim in a pool or enjoy our many off-beach activities,"" the site said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan, and in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Grand Isle, Louisiana . The oil's biggest impact in Louisiana is on the portion of the coast from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east, according to a state emergency website. ""Most of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, 70 percent, is unaffected by the oil spill and remains open for commercial and recreational fishing,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website.

223,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Farrah Fawcett's death a year ago was the top story for only a few hours, quickly eclipsed by shocking news that Michael Jackson had died. Jackson arrived in an ambulance at UCLA Medical Center three miles away and just three hours after Fawcett was pronounced dead at another hospital on June 25, 2009. ""It was such an odd coincidence that she and Michael Jackson should die just within hours of each other,"" Fawcett's closest friend, Alana Stewart, said. ""It's just amazing that something like that could happen."" Fawcett might have ""gotten a smile about the attention being off her,"" Stewart said . ""I always had the sense that Farrah would kind of be getting a laugh out of that and saying 'Thank God, they're over there, finally. They're leaving me alone. The paparazzi, the reporters, the news cameras.'"" Stewart is not so understanding about the Academy Awards producers decision not to include Fawcett in their 2010 Oscar tribute to movie figures who had died. ""I was so angry,"" she said. ""I called up the director of the Academy the next day and never thought that he would take my call, and he did take my call. And I said, 'Please tell me this was a horrible oversight.' And he said, 'No, there was a lot of discussion about it, and finally we felt that she was known more as a television actress.'"" Stewart pointed out that Fawcett acted in at least 16 movies. She was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for her acting in ""The Apostle"" with Robert Duval. One of Fawcett's five Golden Globe nominations was for best actress in the film ""Extremities."" ""I can't imagine why they would have made that decision, and it was just really wrong,"" she said. Fawcett's long battle with cancer was closely followed by fans, thanks in part to a camera carried by Stewart. Fawcett asked Stewart to tape her doctor's visits at first as a way to remember what she was told, but she later decided to make it public. The documentary ""Farrah's Story"" aired just five weeks before her death. The actress, whose hair and face made her a global icon, chose to not hide the ravages of her disease under makeup. ""She wanted it to be real, and she didn't want any window dressing on this battle with cancer,"" Stewart said. ""She felt like she could really make a difference and that she could help others and she could share her experience in this battle with cancer with other people who were also battling cancer,"" Stewart said. Fawcett traveled to Germany to seek alternative cancer treatments not offered in the United States. ""She said to the doctor in Germany one day, 'You know, I'm glad I got cancer, because now I know I can make a difference,'"" Stewart said. Even after her death, she is battling cancer through the Farrah Fawcett Foundation, which will fund research and clinical trials of alternative treatments for anal and pediatric cancers, Stewart said. ""Some of the traditional things in the beginning of her treatment here really harmed her and really sucked the life out of her,"" Stewart said. ""They were so debilitating."" Fawcett searched for ""cutting edge"" alternatives to the chemotherapy that was ""like napalming your body,"" Stewart says. Fawcett's story -- which Stewart also chronicled in her book ""My Journey With Farrah"" -- is about a woman fighting to live against mounting odds of a spreading cancer. It was a spirit that kept her alive, she said. ""The kind of cancer she had and the way it had spread, most people wouldn't have lived as long as she lived,"" Stewart said. ""What's so incredible about her story is that she had this indomitable spirit and this incredible courage, and you know also her sense of humor."" It was a battle that she never thought she would lose, always expecting the miracle, Stewart said. ""She fought until the very last day,"" she said. ""The doctors, the nurses, everyone around her said they had never seen someone fight so hard. And she did not want to give up. Not for one second. Not till the very end."" Stewart, who was at her hospital bedside when Fawcett died, will say little about her last moments. ""I just felt like that was a very personal, private time and I can say that she went very peacefully with just a few people around her,"" she said. ""Ryan (O'Neal) was there, I was there, her friend Mela (Murphy) was there, the nurse and the doctor were there, and that was it."" The ""Charlie's Angels"" actress will be remembered on the anniversary of her death when her closest friends gather in Beverly Hills, California, Friday to cut the ribbon on the Farrah Fawcett Foundation's new headquarters.","Michael Jackson's death hours later overshadowed Fawcett's .

224,"Okaloosa Island, Florida (CNN) -- Vacationers were the first to notice the bird fumbling in the water near this popular tourist beach last week. It bobbed and swayed differently than other birds, and didn't react when humans came dangerously close. Once it was ashore, they could see why: a light sheen of oil covered its feathers. Animal health technician Stephanie Neumann tried to rescue the Northern Gannet, but beach safety officers stopped her. Her coworkers at the Emerald Coast Wildlife Refuge already had stabilized birds and a sea turtle affected by the Gulf oil disaster, but officials wanted to know: Did she have a contract with BP? Could she -- and the bird --wait while they verified her organization's status? ""They're trying to do their job,"" Neumann said as she crouched over the motionless bird, wrapped in a white sheet and barely hidden from the stares of kids and parents. ""They have to make sure protocol is followed."" When brown clumps of tar began to wash up on the snow-white beaches around Destin last week, the mood in this sunny beach community shifted from optimistic denial to furious worry. Local ideas about how to protect the area clashed with plans from BP, state and federal agencies. Community volunteers struggling to cut through protocol cheered a decision by Okaloosa County to defy BP and the feds. They were done waiting. They'd use their own plans. ""This is ridiculous. We'll take the heat. We would do whatever it took to stop the oil,"" said the county commission chairman, Wayne Harris. After months of wrangling with agencies responding to the spill, Harris wasn't willing to stake the county's ecology and economy only on boom that captures or absorbs oil. The commission authorized emergency management teams to add skimmers, barges and extra boom, and an air wall they hope will push the oil away. They plan to layer prevention measures in the pass that connects the Gulf to Choctawhatchee Bay, where fresh and salt water mix and dolphins play. Harris said the plan could cost up to $6 million per month, which he hopes will be covered by money from BP. The county developed its oil plan in the days after the disaster began to unfold, but it was plagued by miscommunications, disagreements and bureaucracy once it left local hands, Harris said. Communities along the Gulf Coast have made similar complaints. Mayors grilled a BP official about the response during a press conference earlier this month. In Magnolia Springs, Alabama, locals went outside the federal plan and risked incarceration by adding boom and barges to protect Weeks Bay. In Pointe Aux Chenes, Louisiana, Native Americans pitched in to string boom near an island where many of their ancestors are buried. Harris said some of his county's efforts may work; others may not. ""Doing something is better than doing nothing,"" he said. On the Okaloosa Island beach, local response to the oiled Gannet was quicker, but the federal response had less red tape to work through. U.S. Fish and Wildlife workers arrived before Neumann's status was verified, so she left their bird in their care. ""Time is essential with these guys,"" she said. ""Every minute counts."" For the rest of Okaloosa County, more boom and barges were starting to appear in the water. The county commission vote was ""smart,"" and sped up the state and federal response, said public safety director Dino Villani, who was quickly invited to an ""olive branch"" meeting in Mobile. Most of the county's preferred plans are moving forward, Villani said, and they'll continue to adapt as the oil moves throughout their waters. Harris said the plans would have gone forward even without approval from BP or other government agencies. ""I'm sure they're cussing. I'm sure they're cussing us bad,"" Harris said. ""If we had waited, we'd still be waiting. Why did it take us giving an ultimatum?"" Charles Diorio, a Coast Guard commander in Mobile, said some communities decided to implement their own plans once they saw they didn't top the list of state and federal priorities, if they were on the list at all. Some just wanted to act before the mess -- and response agencies' attention -- began to move their way. Now that oil is reaching Florida's shores, resources are shifting there, Diorio said, and there's a plan to meet with Okaloosa commissioners this week. ""Now is the time to make sure these relationships are still working and strong and the lines of communication are open,"" he said. The commission's vote marked a turning point for Okaloosa County residents and vacationers. Even as oil crippled fishing, tourism and ecology in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, wishful thinkers hoped for the best around Destin, which calls itself the ""World's Luckiest Fishing Village."" ""I'm guilty of it. Every day something doesn't happen, you walk down your beach and don't see it, the feeling gets stronger -- until it arrives,"" Okaloosa County's beach safety division chief Tracey Vause said as he picked gummy tar balls from the sand. ""I was infuriated. It's almost like grieving. This is the destination, white, sandy beaches. Now they're not."" June is typically a busy month along the area known as Florida's Emerald Coast. Beaches in Destin and Fort Walton are usually packed with families freed from school and work, and the water is crammed with boats. But when traces of oil actually arrived last week, clean-up crews were on land and familiar local fishermen wore life jackets, a tell-tale sign they were called into service for BP. Tourist rentals already were down as much as 50 percent, county officials said. Shops were quiet, service jobs were cut back and only a few umbrellas and towels were scattered across the soft sand. No oil-related illnesses or injuries had been reported as of late last week, said Cecilia Wagner, a community health worker for Okaloosa County. A health advisory warned beachgoers against swimming one day last week, but it was lifted hours later. The arrival of oil spooked residents, and made clear the conflicts between local action and BP's response. On the boardwalk at Okaloosa Island, volunteers cleaned up after a group of campers made oil-absorbing boom from hosiery and animal hair. Boom makers Yente Sehman and Barbara Johnson said they'd prefer boom made with renewable resources in the water around Okaloosa County's beaches, and as oil came closer, more materials and volunteers had showed up to help their efforts. In a warehouse nearby, the pair stacked human and animal hair donations funneled through the non-profit Matter of Trust and postmarked from Missouri, Georgia, Massachusetts, Australia and China. Volunteers packed dog and alpaca hair clippings into the legs of pantyhose, then tied them off and strung them into mesh casings with plastic pieces that float in the water. Already, more than 5,000 boom were stacked inside the warehouse. County officials said they don't want to discourage volunteers, but they aren't planning to use the animal hair boom, except as a last resort. Sehman's phone was busy with calls from local business owners and real estate agents who wanted the boom to protect their businesses, but organizers can't give the boom away without county approval and a clear plan for its disposal. ""We live in paradise and everybody wants to believe it's not going to happen to us,"" Johnson said. ""It's turning into anger and frustration. BP, local government, state government, everybody sitting around waiting for someone else to do something. We want to help, but we can't."" Still, the women said they won't stop their boom-making effort, especially as more community members notice the empty beaches studded with tar balls and look for ways to get involved. ""Once we started, no way,"" Sehman said. ""I'm very proud to live in this county at this point in time. People of this county are going to do what they want to do.""","Residents and vacationers in Okaloosa County in Florida are starting to spot tar balls and oiled wildlife on their beaches.
County commissioners voted to respond to the oil spill with their own plans, regardless of whether unified command approved.
Unified command sped up approval of their plans and will meet with commissioners this week.",67683 1277 1287 122 32591 37 0 69 2 2386 0 4344 33500 4 0 622 299 24 691 3388 1610 55 131 13 43300 3 18575

225,"(CNN) -- An EF1-scale tornado briefly touched down Thursday in Bridgeport, Connecticut, knocking out windows and ripping signs and awnings off buildings, the National Weather Service confirmed Friday. With winds at an estimated 100 mph, the twister took only about five minutes to cause the damage in downtown Bridgeport, eyewitnesses said. The areas affected included several streets near Interstate 95, the National Weather Service said. ""In seconds it just turned black, and you can't see across the street. There was foggy, crazy hard rain,"" said eyewitness Beth Bowman, who was in a downtown bookstore when the twister barreled through. After five minutes of darkness, the weather cleared and the sun came out, Bowman said. The damage from the brief but powerful storm included uprooted trees and overturned U.S. postal boxes, she said. The Bridgeport Police Department said the storm caused significant damage.

226,"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's last physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, wasn't the one who gave the pop star a fatal overdose of propofol, according to Murray's attorney, hinting at the defense strategy in the involuntary manslaughter case against his client. ""The fact (of the way) that he died was a mystery a year ago, and still is,"" Houston attorney Ed Chernoff told CNN in an exclusive interview recently. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson's June 25, 2009, death was from an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep. Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. His preliminary hearing is expected this fall. Murray, hired as Jackson's personal doctor while he rehearsed for his comeback concerts, admits he was giving Jackson propofol as a sleep aid, but Chernoff said the amount was much smaller than what was found in Jackson's body during the autopsy. The toxicology results included in the autopsy report said the propofol level was equal to what would be used to sedate a patient for major surgery. ""There is no way that Dr. Murray pumped Michael Jackson full of propofol sufficient for major surgery,"" Chernoff said. ""No way. I would stake anything that I own on this fact."" Theories of how Jackson might have gotten the fatal dose, other than from Murray, include someone else entering the upstairs bedroom and administering it -- or Jackson waking up and giving it to himself. A anesthesia expert hired by the coroner addressed the possibility that Jackson may have accidentally killed himself with propofol. ""It would have been difficult for the patient to administer the drugs to himself, given the configuration of the IV set-up,"" the expert wrote in the autopsy report. Chernoff said the possibility was not completely ruled out by the expert. ""The coroner's report deemed it to be unlikely, because it would be difficult, so I'm assuming they've addressed that situation and that's what they believe, but is it possible? Absolutely, it's possible,"" Chernoff said. Jackson's personal doctor . Chernoff said Murray had no idea what he was getting into when he signed on as Jackson's personal physician. Murray was reluctant to accept the job despite the $150,000 monthly salary, Chernoff said. ""He was leaving two practices, one in Houston and one in Nevada,"" Chernoff said. ""He was going to be giving up those practices that he built up over 20 years, with no guarantee that when he was done with Michael Jackson he would have his practices back."" Murray knew Jackson had trouble sleeping, but did not know he was using propofol as a sleep aid, Chernoff said. ""Did Dr. Murray know that 'when I get onboard treating Michael Jackson that I'm going to have to deal with this drug propofol?' No,"" Chernoff said. Chernoff said Murray was trying to wean Jackson off an addiction to propofol. ""He wanted to help him do that,"" Chernoff said. ""Who else is addicted to a drug like propofol?"" The anesthesia expert consulted in the autopsy report said propofol was intended for use only in a surgical setting. But Chernoff defended Murray's usage of the drug in a residential setting. ""The fact that medicines may have been prescribed or administered at home -- that alone doesn't make it egregious,"" he said. ""A hospital is just four walls. I can't say he was in over his head, but he certainly was intending to try to help Jackson get off that drug."" The hours before Jackson died . Murray told investigators that he tried for nine hours to get Jackson to sleep the day he died, starting at 1:30 a.m. By 10:40 a.m., after giving Jackson several other sleep aids, Murray said he gave Jackson 25 milligrams of propofol through an intravenous tube attached to Jackson's leg. The doctor's whereabouts during the 90 minutes leading up to when Jackson was found unresponsive are unclear. Phone records show Murray made three calls totaling 47 minutes during that time. Murray told investigators he left Jackson's side for ""two minutes maximum"" while he went to use the bathroom, according to a police affidavit filed in the case. The timing is important because it's the only window when someone else, including Jackson, could have administered the fatal dose of propofol. Prosecutors said the evidence points toward Murray as the only person responsible for Jackson's death. Chernoff said he's confident that a jury will see it differently. ""We get a fair jury and we are able to afford just some of the necessary experts and investigators then, yes, the doctor is going to win,"" he said. ""Whatever the doctor did for Michael Jackson, whatever he did, was to help, and he took the necessary precautions and then something happened that is unexplainable,"" Chernoff said.","Lawyer: Dr. Murray did not give Jackson fatal overdose .

227,"(CNN) -- Authorities in southern California said the strong smell of marijuana helped them discover $45 million worth of drugs in the back of a tractor-trailer they had pulled over for a traffic violation. Deputies stopped the truck Wednesday morning, then opened the trailer after finding problems with the paperwork for the load, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office said Friday. An ""overwhelming odor"" led investigators to about 20 tons of narcotics stashed in pallets in the back of the truck, including about 38,000 pounds of marijuana, 2,700 pounds of cocaine and 67 pounds of methamphetamine, the sheriff's office said in a statement. Sheriff Rod Hoops said Friday night the seizure was one of the largest in the county's history. The truck's driver, Fernando Luevano, 32, was arrested and charged with possession, transportation and sale of narcotics, authorities said.","""Overwhelming odor"" in tractor-trailer leads to major drug bust, authorities say .

228,"Srinagar, Indian-Controlled Kashmir (CNN) -- One person was killed and four others injured Sunday when Indian security forces opened fire on a violent mob that tried to torch a paramilitary bunker in Srinagar, the capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir. The incident occurred during the funeral of a youth who died in the hospital Saturday night after he was allegedly beaten by members of the Indian paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force during violent protests last week. The family of 25-year-old Rafiq Bangroo said CRPF troopers struck him on the head with gun butts, causing a fatal skull injury. The CRPF has denied the allegation, saying Bangroo died after he was pelted with stones. Bangroo's body was handed over to relatives. As it was being carried for burial Sunday, angry mobs charged at a bunker of the CRPF and attempted to burn it, police said. The CRPF troopers manning the bunker opened fire on the crowd. Five people were injured, and one, a 26-year-old man, later died. ""They tried to torch the bunker after damaging it. Our soldiers opened fire in self-defense,"" CRPF spokesman Prabhakar Tripathi told CNN. As the clashes started spreading Sunday, Indian security forces were rushed to the area to enforce an undeclared curfew. Hundreds shouting ""We want freedom"" joined the funeral procession. Bangroo's death triggered impromptu protests in various parts of the city. Police and paramilitary troops used tear gas and baton charges and fired warning shots in the air in some spots to break up the angry protesters, according to authorities. The Kashmiri separatist group All Parties Hurriyat Conference has called for a Kashmir-wide shutdown Monday to protest the killings. Srinagar has been tense over the past week following the killing of another youth, a 17-year-old student who died June 11 after being struck in the head by a police-fired tear smoke shell. Kashmir been in the throes of a violent separatist campaign for over two decades and has been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan. The mounting toll in the region's two-decade-old insurgency is placed at over 43,000 by officials, while various rights groups and NGOs put the figure at twice the official number.","Indian security forces open fire on protesters .

229,"Beijing, China (CNN) -- More than 1,000 people have been rescued from rushing flood waters in eastern China after a dike burst on the Fu river in Jiangxi province, the Xinhua news agency reported. About 35,000 people had to flee the area because of the rushing water, the news agency said. This new flooding comes as heavy rains have battered nine Chinese provinces -- including Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces -- in the last two weeks. Devastating floods have already killed 199 people and left another 123 missing, Xinhua reported, quoting a Ministry of Civil Affairs statement. More than 29 million have been affected with almost 2.6 million evacuated from their homes, Xinhua said. Total economic losses could reach 42.12 billion yuan ($6.17 billion) with 1.6 million hectares of farmland flooded and 12.5 percent of crops destroyed. Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao called for an all-out effort to combat floods and rescue victims Tuesday, Xinhua reported. iReport: Are you there? Share photos, video .

230,"VERACRUZ, Mexico (CNN) -- With Hurricane Dean hours away from a second dangerous encounter with Mexico, government officials warned residents of Veracruz and other coastal towns to prepare for its arrival. A resident tries to make his way through a flooded street in Chetumal, Mexico, Tuesday. Not only is the area particularly prone to flooding, a nuclear plant near the city supplies power to much of northern Mexico. While the facility itself is safe, high winds could affect some pylons carrying electricity away from the plant, CNN's Karl Penhaul reported. Winds were picking up and waves were growing higher as evening fell in Veracruz, he said, even though Dean's predicted landfall was 12 to 18 hours away. After raking Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula earlier, making landfall as a Category 5 storm -- the most extreme level on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity -- Dean was back to Category 1 as it entered the Bay of Campeche later Tuesday. It was forecast to build back up to Category 2 intensity before its second landfall. At 11 p.m. ET, Dean's maximum sustained winds remained near 80 mph as the storm moved  west-northwest at near 18 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. ""On this forecast track, Dean is expected to be very near the coast of central Mexico during the day Wednesday,"" according to the center.  See the storm's projected path » . Authorities set up temporary shelters around Tuxpan, Mexico, with the capacity to hold thousands, according to Ramon Rodriguez, municipal president of the city. The evacuation of 5,000 people in the urban areas and 4,500 people in the rural areas was under way, he said. Residents of unstable areas were being urged to go to temporary shelters as soon as possible. On the Yucatan, Mexico's tourist areas dodged a bullet, but President Felipe Calderon expressed concern for some of the peninsula's poor Mayan communities that may have borne the brunt of the storm.  Watch Dean batter Mexico » . ""We still have to know what happened in the more isolated communities,"" Calderon said, speaking at a summit in Quebec, Canada, with President Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The Mexican leader left the summit early, saying he would head to the Yucatan to ""supervise the rescue missions"" which will concentrate on the poorer indigenous communities. ""I have a great deal of concern for the housing and the lack of services in that general area for the indigenous people there and that will be the main area of concern for us,"" he said. Calderon said the government suspended oil production near the city of Campeche, Mexico's main oil production center, as Dean passed -- cutting off about 2.5 million barrels of oil per day -- and evacuated nearly 20,000 workers from oil platforms in the area. Downed power lines and damaged buildings were reported in Mexico and northern Belize. But even in the hardest-hit area, Red Cross officials said, no deaths were reported and there was only one minor injury, CNN's Gary Tuchman said.  See CNN correspondents track Dean through Mexico » . Streets were flooded in Chetumal, just south of where Dean's center made landfall around 4:30 a.m. (5:30 a.m. ET) with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (266 kph), according to the hurricane center.  Power was out in the coastal city, where most of the 130,000 residents appeared to have heeded government warnings to seek shelter or evacuate. But overall, there was no major damage in Chetumal and the sense was that ""this could have been a lot worse,"" CNN's Harris Whitbeck reported. Watch CNN coverage as Dean made landfall . The storm's eye passed just south of the resort areas of Cozumel and Cancun, Mexico, striking a rural and sparsely populated area. Watch as Dean sweeps through Playa del Carmen . Some of those Mayan communities Calderon spoke of were evacuated several days ago, Whitbeck said. About 3,500 Mayan Indians fled from a nature preserve where they live. But many other isolated communities must still be checked out. Ancient Mayan ruins in the town of Tulum, south of Cancun, held up well, resident Enrique Perez told CNN. But the town itself was battered. Local officials say about a third of the hotels and beach cabins in Tulum were damaged, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, in Jamaica, residents cleaned up fallen trees and debris Monday as the island nation started to recover from its brush with Dean on Sunday.

Dean is being blamed for at least nine deaths in its march across the Caribbean, including two in Jamaica, two in Haiti, two in Martinique, two in Dominica and one in St. Lucia. Mexico's Yucatan resort region was devastated in 2005 by Wilma, a Category 3 hurricane. But lessons learned from the fierce storm helped the Yucatan area better prepare for Dean, Quintana Roo Tourism Secretary Gabriella Rodriguez told CNN. ""This was a piece of cake compared to Wilma,"" she said. The U.S. military's Southern Command, said it had deployed a 25-person damage assessment team to Belize. Ahead of the storm, the Mexican government deployed 4,000 troops to the area, and a state of emergency was declared in the inland state of Campeche, where residents were bracing for as much as 20 inches of rain in some places. Forecasters do not believe Dean presents a threat to the United States, although officials in Texas continued to make storm preparations just in case Dean's path takes an unexpected turn. A hurricane warning remains in effect along Mexico's Gulf Coast from the tip of the Yucatan's Gulf Coast near the town of Progreso, northward to Tampico, where ""preparations ... should be rushed to completion,"" the NHC said.

231,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spain is reeling from its most severe drought in 70 years with the nation's reservoirs on average just half full, the Environment Ministry reports. The tower of a former church, underwater before the drought, reappears in the Mediano reservoir. Rainfall has been less than half of what's considered normal for the last six months and reservoir levels were already low after two years in which normal rain levels failed to rebound from the driest 12 months on record -- October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2005. The worst-hit areas are the Catalonia region -- whose capital, Barcelona, is the nation's second-largest city -- and central Spain in the Castilla-La Mancha region near Madrid, according to Antonio Mestre, a climate specialist at the State Meteorological Agency in Madrid. The Baells reservoir near Barcelona is about 20 percent full, and in some places it appears to be bone dry. A little row boat could this week be seen resting on the sandy dirt bottom of the reservoir. In a nearby village, Gelida, trucks already bring drinking water every week because the town's three wells are too dry. It's become a political headache for Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who is just starting his second term. ""Despite the difficult drought years,"" Zapatero said in the investiture debate in parliament, ""there's been no shortage of drinking water anywhere in the country."" But Barcelona might run out by October. The government has decided to quickly build a water pipeline for 60 kilometers (37 miles) along the major AP-7 highway, to pump water in to Barcelona, if necessary by the autumn and depending on reservoir levels at that time. The project would cost 180 million euros ($280 million). The water would come from the Ebro river and that has sparked protests from the regional governments of Valencia and Murcia, down the Mediterranean coast from Barcelona, that the central government is favoring Barcelona. Valencia and Murcia leaders this week threatened to take the case to the Constitutional Court, the highest in Spain. Barcelona-area officials already have restricted the use of water for home gardens and parks and public fountains. They have also considered bringing drinking water in by boat. To tackle chronic water shortages, Spain in recent years has also invested heavily in desalination plants, which take the salt of sea water to make it drinkable -- but several are not yet finished, including one that would serve Barcelona. The latest drought hits Spain just after tens of thousands of new vacation homes have sprung up en masse along the coast in recent years, along with dozens of new golf courses thirsting to stay green. ""The amount of water resources depend not only on precipitation, but also on consumption,"" Mestre said. ""The water demand in Spain has increased a lot in the last 10 or 15 years."" Despite recent showers, the past six months are the driest period in Spain in 70 years, when record-keeping began, Mestre said. Farmers also compete for the water, to irrigate their fields, which are suffering in the latest drought. Some critics say that successive Spanish governments have repeatedly taken short term measures during droughts, rather than making long-term water-use plans. One old fisherman at the Riosequillo reservoir - an hour north of Madrid and just a third full despite the recent rains - said he'd never seen it so bad. ""We'd have so much progress,"" said Gregorio Consentini, the 78-year-old fisherman, ""but we're doing badly."" To make matters worse, he didn't catch any fish that day -- which he also blamed on the drought. E-mail to a friend .","Spanish reservoirs on average half full after six dry months .

232,"About 1 in 7, or 13.5 percent of adults who encountered intense dust clouds after the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11 were later found to have asthma, compared with just 8.4 percent who had no dust cloud exposure, researchers in Atlanta and New York City reported on Tuesday. Among rescue workers, the asthma risk was highest for those who worked on the pile on September 11. Likewise, among various groups of people connected to the Twin Tower collapse, rescue and recovery workers were more likely to have a diagnosis of asthma (12.2 percent) than passers-by (8.4 percent). The results are from a survey, conducted from November 2006 through December 2007, to assess the health status of more than 46,000 adults five to six years after the disaster. Health.com: Bad air day? Here's how to survive . That such a horrific event left lasting physical and emotional scars is, perhaps, no great surprise. Among adults with no prior diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 23.8 percent have reported symptoms after September 11, and the prevalence of symptoms has increased over time, researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The mental health effects, which can be debilitating and often chronic, ""seem to be the largest health problem coming out of 9/11"" says Lorna Thorpe, Ph.D., the deputy commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Division of Epidemiology and one of the coauthors of the study. ""But immediately after the 9/11 event, I don't think there was a clear understanding of what the physical impacts would be."" Health.com: Is your child's asthma under control? Take this test . People in the vicinity of the collapse had ""the potential to inhale huge amounts of particulate matter,"" observes Joan Reibman, M.D., an associate professor of medicine and environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and the director of the school's Bellevue Asthma Center, who was not involved in the study. ""We think that could act as a real irritant to the airways."" Some 23 million Americans have asthma, a lung condition that causes airway swelling and inflammation. People with asthma may experience repeated bouts of coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and tightness in the chest. Anthony M. Szema, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine and surgery and the head of the allergy diagnostic unit at SUNY Stony Brook School of Medicine, has studied the effects of the World Trade Center collapse on children living in Manhattan's Chinatown. His team's most recent study, accepted for publication in Allergy & Asthma Proceedings, will show that the rate of asthma at the closest elementary school to the World Trade Center (29 percent) is high compared with the rate of asthma in children in the general population. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 9.3 percent of U.S. children have asthma. ""[The new study] is entirely congruous with our findings,"" he says.

Brackbill, Ph.D., M.P.H., led the team of New York City and Columbia University researchers whose study examined the longer-term health impact of exposure to Ground Zero and its varying effect across groups of people. The analysis is based on data from the World Trade Center Health Registry, described as the largest post-disaster-exposure registry in U.S. history. More than 71,000 rescue and recovery workers, lower Manhattan office workers, nearby residents, and passers-by enrolled in the registry. Participants were interviewed from September 2003 through November 2004 to record their exposure to the disaster and document their pre- and post-event health status, and again in 2006-2007.

Among rescue and recovery workers, for example, the asthma risk was highest for those who worked on the pile on September 11. The risk diminished with later start dates. However, even downtown office workers and lower Manhattan residents were affected. Among these people, the risk of asthma was highest if there was a heavy coating of dust in their home or office, compared with no such damage. ""It shows that people who had heavy dust exposure in the initial period, that this was a risk to developing asthma but not the only risk,"" says Reibman, who also serves as the director of New York City's World Trade Center Environmental Health Center, one of three centers dedicated to treating September 11-related conditions. Reibman says the new study is important because, in addition to corroborating previous studies, it should help people with September 11-related asthma realize that their symptoms are real.

233,"(CNN) -- Boeing says it has notified all 767 aircraft operators about cracks found on two American Airlines 767-300 planes, and by mid-July will recommend more frequent maintenance checks. American Airlines found the cracks in large pylons that hold engines onto the wings of two of its 767-300 aircraft, which Boeing currently recommends inspecting every 1,500 takeoff and landing cycles. ""Boeing will recommend decreasing the number of flight cycles between inspections of the pylon mid spar fitting from every 1,500 flight cycles to possibly as low as every 400 flight cycles,"" the company said late Wednesday. About 260 planes constructed in the same manner as the damaged American Airlines aircraft could be affected by the recommendation, Boeing said. American Airlines spokesman Tim Wagner said the problem was first discovered on one of its 767-300s about two weeks ago during a maintenance check targeting other parts of the aircraft. The airline then found cracking on one more 767-300 after inspecting a total of 56 aircraft -- 767-300 and 767-200s -- a process American Airlines completed Monday night. ""We found these issues when it's best to find them, which is early on,"" said Wagner. The airline has sent the first damaged pylon to a metallurgy lab to try to determine why it cracked. ""Until that metallurgy testing is completed no one knows what the cause is,"" said Wagner. The damaged planes were among American's older aircraft, Wagner added. American flies Boeing 767-300s on international routes as well as long-haul domestic routes. The 767-200s fly primarily transcontinental routes. Airlines have previously found similar cracks at the holes where the pylon attaches to the wing, which led Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration five years ago to recommend checks every 1,500 cycles. At that time, when the FAA issued an airworthiness directive it said, ""We are issuing this (directive)  to prevent fatigue cracking in the primary strut structure and reduced structural integrity of the strut, which could result in separation of the strut and engine.""","American Airlines found cracks on two 767-300 aircraft .

234,"(CNN) -- The oil spill on the Gulf Coast has states and visitors bureaus working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . Oil has affected sections of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key beaches, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Photos from the area showed patches of dark, syrup-like oil on the white sand. Pensacola Beach is open, but the waters from the Park West recreation area to the area just west of Portofino are closed to all swimming and wading until further notice because of large quantities of emulsified oil in shore waters and along the shoreline, the bureau said. ""The shoreline and water along Santa Rosa Sound on the north side of the island is still clean, clear and open for swimming,"" according to the bureau's website. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . The beaches in Fort Walton Beach, Destin and Okaloosa Island are open to the public, and the air quality is good, according to the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, which represents the three destinations. ""Depending on the wind direction, tar balls may float ashore in Destin or Ft. Walton Beach later in the week, but cleaning crews are standing by,"" the bureau's website said. Pebble-sized tar balls have been washing ashore on some beaches of south Walton County. The local health department has also issued a health advisory for the area stretching from the Miramar Beach Access eastward to the end of Topsail Hill State Preserve. All beaches remain open, according to the Walton County Tourist Development Council's website. Meanwhile, small scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach, but the beaches are open and the swimming is still safe, the area's visitors bureau website said. ""Our sugary white sand beaches are open for the enjoyment of our guests and, as of now, we are seeing only intermittent impact,"" according to the bureau. iReport: A slick trip to Perdido Key . Dime-size to 5-inch tar balls continue to wash up in widely scattered areas of northwest Florida, but all of the state's beaches remain open, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. But several spots have been affected by the oil spill. A health advisory is in effect from Walkover 23 on Pensacola Beach, Florida, to the west tip of Santa Rosa Island including Fort Pickens. This advisory extends to the Perdido Key area, including Johnson Beach. ""Because of significant quantities of oil in the water and coming ashore signage and flags advise visitors to not wade or swim in the water,"" according to the park. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""The beaches are open and visitors are still welcome to sunbathe and walk the beach, but we strongly suggest they swim in a pool or enjoy our many off-beach activities,"" the site said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan, and in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Grand Isle, Louisiana . The oil's biggest impact in Louisiana is on the portion of the coast from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east, according to a state emergency website. ""Most of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, 70 percent, is unaffected by the oil spill and remains open for commercial and recreational fishing,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website.

235,"(CNN) -- One of the men killed in Monday's coal mine explosion in West Virginia knew of the danger but didn't let it bother him, his family said Tuesday. The blast at the Massey Energy Co. mine in Montcoal, West Virginia, killed at least 25 miners; four others are unaccounted for, officials say. The cause of the explosion had not been determined as rescuers worked Tuesday to bore ventilation holes into the Upper Big Branch Mine. Benny Willingham, 61, a deacon in his church and the patriarch in his family, was among those killed, relatives told CNN's John Roberts. ""He was a good man. I know everyone thinks that about their loved ones, but Benny truly was a wonderful man,"" Willingham's sister Jean told CNN. ""He loved the Lord, and in church the other day, he thanked the Lord for saving his soul, and he thanked him for watching over him in the mines for over 30 years, and he said, 'If he takes me tomorrow, I've had a good life,' "" she said. iReport: Are you there? Share photos, video . Her brother kept his affairs in order because of the constant risk of death, she said. Still, the accident shocked the family. ""It's scary. It's just really, really scary,"" Willingham's granddaughter Tiffany Ellis said. ""My stepdad also does this, and this is just a wake-up call to me. I've seen it happen before, but I never imagined I'd be here today, telling my story about it."" She said her grandfather stepped in to help raise her after her father walked out on the family years ago. ""I didn't have a dad; my grandfather filled them shoes for me,"" she said. ""He spoiled me. Anything I wanted, his little girl got it. ""He taught me everything, from learning how to tie my shoes to driving, to learning the game about boys. He was always there to listen to my problems, whenever I had them."" The families of the victims are not limited to bloodlines, according to Willingham's relatives and other local residents. ""It's a good community -- tight,"" his daughter Michelle McKinney said. ""We look after each other. We support each other."" ""If you're from here, you're part of a coal mining family,"" Grace Lafferty of Harper told the Charleston Gazette newspaper. ""You know a lot of people who work here. It takes your breath away, your heart drops and you have that empty feeling."" ""Coal mining gets in your blood,"" Willingham's brother-in-law Bobby said. ""The camaraderie is like a sports team. There's no love like the love among workers in coal mines."" After hearing news that miners may be trapped, former miner Randy Cox told the Register-Herald newspaper in Beckley, ""I just got down on my knees and started praying that they were OK."" Cox, of Arnett, West Virginia, mined coal for 18 years and now is disabled, the newspaper reported. ""I never was in a situation like that, but I have seen roof falls,"" Cox said. ""I'm praying for them, and I hope this turns out OK. May God be with them."" CNN's Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.","Benny Willingham, 61, kept his affairs in order, relatives say .
""If [God] takes me tomorrow, I've had a good life,"" he said, according to sister .

236,"(CNN) -- Abby Sunderland says the next goal awaiting her seems more dangerous and unfamiliar than sailing around the world: getting her driver's license. Sunderland, 16, answered questions about her rescue and on-land plans Tuesday in Los Angeles, at her first news conference since returning to the United States. Sunderland's quest to circumnavigate the globe was cut short when a large wave rolled and crippled her boat in the Southern Ocean near Australia. The rogue wave, which she said rolled her boat while she was down below, broke the ship's mast. A fishing vessel from Reunion Island rescued her. Despite falling short of her goal, she sailed a total of 12,000 nautical miles and became the youngest person to sail around Cape Horn at the tip of South America. While she wants to get back to sailing, she said she will wait a few years before trying to circumnavigate the world again. For now, she plans to finish high school and get back to normal life. Sunderland said she is happy to be home, disappointed that she didn't make it all the way around the world, but proud of what she did accomplish. It's really great to think that I may have inspired some people to go for their dreams"" she said. ""I mean, I'm living proof that things don't always work out the way you plan, but you can only plan so far on an adventure."" Asked her response to those who said she was too young to have embarked on her journey, she said, ""I've crossed two oceans, I've sailed around Cape Horn and Cape Argus -- the question of my age should have been over weeks if not months ago."" iReport: Sunderland speaks out . Sunderland's brother, Zac, family spokesman Lyle Mercer, and Jeff Casher, a technical advisor for her voyage, also spoke at the news conference. The young sailor's mother and father, Marianne and Laurence Sunderland, missed the news conference because Marianne was in labor, Mercer said. They plan to name the child Paul after the captain of the ship that rescued Abby Sunderland, Mercer said. Marianne and Laurence Sunderland have been criticized nationally for letting their child embark on a seemingly dangerous mission alone. In a statement read by Mercer, they said the ""intense personal criticism crossed the line of human decency,"" and that people don't realize how meticulously they planned the trip. ""Parenting isn't easy for any of us,"" they said in the statement. Abby Sunderland said she and her brother, who set the record as the youngest person to sail around the world alone at 17 last year, have grown closer because of their common experience of being isolated on the ocean. Zac Sunderland said at the news conference that he isn't bitter about his younger sister receiving more media attention for her adventure. While plans for a reality show fell through, Abby Sunderland wants to write about her trip for herself and will consider turning it into a book, she said.","Abby Sunderland answered questions at her first U.S. news conference Tuesday .

237,"Crawfordville, Florida (CNN) -- When Chris Beatty got word about the oil spill in the Gulf, like many Floridians, she wanted to help -- but she wanted to help in a very specific way. Beatty runs an organization called the Florida Wild Mammal Association (FWMA) in Crawfordville, Florida.  The organization houses injured and sick wildlife and nurses them back to health so that they can be released back into the wild. Working very closely with animals, she realized that the region's wildlife could be in serious danger because of the oil spill disaster. The FWMA takes in over a thousand animals a year -- possums, raccoons, deer and birds. Seeing images of oiled birds and wildlife splashed across the news channels, Beatty wanted to be ready in case they were called upon to take in these animals. After recognizing that people in her community were feeling the same way, Beatty and the FWMA organized a volunteer day and opened their doors to locals who wanted to help out. In just that one day they received roughly $19,000 in cash, supplies and free labor, including $5,400 in donations and $13,600 in labor and supplies. Beatty believes that her community wanted to help because the wildlife is so much a part of what the state is all about. ""The whole panhandle is a rural area,"" Beatty said. ""And that's what our livelihoods depend on.  So without wildlife, we'd be very damaged.""","Florida group gets cash, labor and supplies .

238,"South Padre Island, Texas (CNN) -- Hurricane Alex made landfall along the northeastern coast of Mexico Wednesday night as a Category 2 storm with 105 mph winds, the National Hurricane Center reported. As the storm lashed a sparsely populated area about 110 miles south of the Texas border, Gulf Coast residents hunkered down in shelters.  Maximum sustained winds were 100 mph as Alex moved to the west at 10 mph. At least 1,000 people in southern Texas were taking shelter in evacuation centers as Alex's winds and heavy rain squalls bore down on the coastline, officials in Cameron and Hidalgo counties reported. Brownsville, Texas, appeared to be taking the brunt of Alex's outer bands after as many as six tornadoes were reported in the area, officials said. Sgt. Jimmy Manrrique, spokesman for the Brownsville Police Department, said the city was receiving ""an intense amount of rain"" and flood waters were reported to be as high as 2 feet in some areas. In Harlingen, just 30 miles north of Brownsville, wind gusts of up to 65 mph were reported hours before the storm's expected landfall. No injuries were immediately reported from the twisters near Brownsville, but some damage was reported, including downed trees and power lines, weather and emergency management officials said. Carol Rumsey was riding the storm out in her Los Fresnos, Texas, home, not far from Brownsville and about a half hour from the coast. She told CNN Radio on Wednesday night that her house had an eerie feel as the storm approached. ""You board up your windows and it's like living in a dungeon,"" she said. ""You can't hear anything, you can't see anything."" She said she had considered evacuating as the region was being pummeled by heavy rain and occasional gusts of wind, but said ""this is the price you pay for living in paradise."" Meanwhile, authorities in South Padre Island closed the Queen Isabella Memorial Bridge -- which crosses to the popular vacation spot -- as a precaution ahead of the approaching Alex. At 10 p.m. CT (11 p.m. ET), the storm's maximum sustained winds were 100 mph as it headed west at 10 mph, the National Hurricane Center reported. Forecasters said the storm was expected to continue in that direction and move farther inland over northeastern Mexico Thursday. Tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 205 miles from the center of the storm and hurricane force winds extend outward up to 35 miles, according to the hurricane center. Heavy rain and thunderstorms associated with the outer bands of Alex were affecting the entire Gulf Coast from Texas to Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. Brownsville received more than 4 inches of rain by Wednesday afternoon, the weather service said. Harlingen Assistant Fire Chief Cirilo Rodriguez said his region was expecting 7-10 inches of rain. Coastal flood advisories have been issued for Louisiana and Mississippi. Minor coastal flooding is expected along the shore due to a prolonged strong southeasterly wind caused by the large counterclockwise circulation of the hurricane. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Wednesday that the state is prepared for the storm. The State Operations Center is fully activated, he said, and Texas continues to work with federal and local authorities to track the hurricane and the BP Gulf oil disaster. ""As Hurricane Alex grows in strength and approaches landfall, Texas is ready to handle this storm and its impact,"" Perry said in a written statement ahead of the storm. ""My message to South Texans is to finish your preparations, stay connected to credible information sources and heed the warnings of your local officials, who are closely integrated with the state's emergency management effort that has been mobilized to prepare for Alex's impact."" President Barack Obama issued a federal emergency declaration for Texas ahead of Alex's expected arrival, the White House said Tuesday night. After the hurricane made landfall around 9 p.m. CT (10 p.m. ET), forecasters from the National Hurricane Center changed the hurricane warning to a tropical storm warning for the coast of Texas south of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande. A tropical storm warning issued earlier remained in place along the Texas coast from Baffin Bay to Port O'Connor. A hurricane warning was in place for the coast of Mexico from the mouth of the Rio Grande to La Cruza, Mexico. The storm continued to move away from the massive BP oil catastrophe near the Louisiana coast in the northern Gulf of Mexico, but it already was complicating cleanup efforts. The storm created 12-foot waves Tuesday and oil-skimming ships were sent to shore from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. The rough seas may force crews to replace and reorganize booms meant to deter the oil from reaching shore, reported CNN's Ed Lavandera. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist said that even though Florida may dodge any problems with this storm, the Atlantic hurricane season is just beginning. ""In Florida, we've had a lot of hurricanes a number of years ago, but we handled them very well,"" he told CNN's Campbell Brown. ""The difference and the distinction that we face now is that we have a Gulf of Mexico that's full of oil. So our hope and our prayer is that we don't have a mixture of hurricanes with oil that could potentially damage the beautiful beaches of Florida. But if we do, we're prepared for it."" Pat Ahumada, the mayor of Brownsville, said the city was expecting to distribute 60,000 sandbags and provide shelter for roughly 2,000 families.  Utility crews were on standby to handle outages.  At the same time, the state government provided 90 buses in case an evacuation is needed. ""I expect about 10 percent of residents to evacuate voluntarily, which already started yesterday,"" Ahumada said Tuesday.  ""I see a steady flow of people going out, but no bottlenecks -- which is good. ""We're not taking it lightly,"" he said.  ""We're ready for a worst-case scenario."" CNN meteorologist Sean Morris and CNN's Dave Alsup, Matt Cherry and Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report.","NEW: Hurricane makes landfall with 105 mph winds .

239,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Fifteen Africans died while trying to reach Spain's southern coast in a small, overcrowded boat, Spanish officials told CNN on Thursday. Thousands of African migrants risk their lives trying to reach mainland Europe in small, overcrowded boats. Rescue teams located the craft late Wednesday off the coast of Almeria province and helped it ashore. Aboard were 33 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and a dead woman. They told authorities that 14 others, including nine young children, had died en route and were dropped overboard, officials told CNN. The survivors included men, women and a months-old baby.It was the second incident in a week involving African migrants. Authorities said a ship overturned off the coast of Motril, killing 14 people -- 23 others were rescued. Spain is the preferred route to Europe for many Africans. Hopeful immigrants typically pay hundreds of dollars to illegal smugglers for a seat on a small boat. The number of attempted crossings usually increases during the summer months when the seas are calmer, Paco Gil, government spokesman in Seville told CNN. The Ministry of Interior said illegal crossings by boat from Africa declined 54 percent in 2007, from a year earlier. A total of 18,000 people were tallied. The decline is due to increased sea patrols off West Africa, along with increased repatriations, officials said. More than 56,000 illegal immigrants were returned to their native countries last year -- a six percent increase compared with 2006. Officials hope the large number of repatriated immigrants will send a message that the costly and perilous crossing could result in nothing more than a trip back home. Immigrants from Latin America, Eastern Europe and Africa make up 10 percent of Spain's population of 45 million. Morocco and Romania are the leading sources, with more than 500,000 immigrants from each nation. Ecuador has sent more than 400,000. The total number of immigrants to Spain from sub-Saharan African countries is far less, but their plight on the boats has sparked a great deal of media attention.","Craft found with 33 people from sub-Saharan Africa and a dead woman .

240,"(CNN) -- An Ohio man says he is seeking a jury trial on a charge of driving under the influence that was slapped on him after he crashed the vehicle he was piloting -- a barstool. The barstool was welded to a small metal frame attached to a five-horsepower lawnmower engine. ""It was just an accident. I mean a little minor accident,"" Kile Wygle, 28, explained in an interview this week with CNN affiliate WSYX. His homemade vehicle was made from a barstool welded to a small metal frame attached to a five-horsepower lawnmower engine, four wheels and a lawnmower steering wheel, according to the Newark, Ohio, police accident report. Officers responding to a report of a crash with injuries March 4 said they found Wygle nursing his injuries and highly intoxicated. According to the police report, when asked how much he had had to drink, Wygle responded, ""a lot."" He crashed during his attempt at a U-turn while speeding down the street in front of his home -- a daring move from atop the specialized barstool even for the most nimble and sober of men. Measuring 6-foot-1 and 230 pounds, and after having consumed what he later told an officer was 15 beers, Wygle appeared to be neither. He was treated at a hospital for minor injuries. According to the police report, Wygle claims his unique vehicle can reach a speed of 38 miles per hour, though at the time of the crash he was going around 20. He entered a plea of not guilty.","Kile Wygle: ""It was just an accident. I mean a little minor accident""

241,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spain commemorated victims of the March 11, 2004 Madrid train bombings with somber ceremonies on Tuesday at three stations in the capital where 191 people died in the Islamic terrorist attacks. A bouquet of flowers for a victim of the 2004 bombings is attached to railings near Atocha station. King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero attended the main ceremony at Atocha station, where most of the casualties came when bombs exploded on one train inside the station and a second on the tracks just outside. Some of the survivors of the attack, which left 1,800 people wounded, gathered with the king and prime minister at the train bombing monument -- a circular glass structure in front of the station that was inaugurated on the third anniversary of the attacks. There were no speeches, just the placement of a floral wreath and the performance of ""Da pacen domine,"" a song for peace, by an orchestral and choir ensemble. Other smaller memorials were held at the Santa Eugenia and Pozo stations down the line from Atocha, where the other two trains were torn apart by explosions four years ago. ""This year it was especially delicate to reach the anniversary,"" Pilar Manjon, who lost a son in the bombings and is president of the March 11 Victims Association, told Spanish radio network SER. ""Everything has been stirred up again. There were elections again."" Zapatero  won an upset victory in 2004 three days after the bombings, and was re-elected last Sunday. A Spanish court last October convicted 21 people in connection with the attacks. Seventeen of those were Islamic terrorists and four were Spaniards who were sentenced for supplying explosives stolen from a Spanish mining operation that ended up being used in the attacks. Seven people were acquitted. Various appeals to that sentence are still pending before Spain's Supreme Court, which is expected to rule on the cases later this year. A few other suspects thought to be linked to the bombings could yet face trial, including two in Morocco and another in Spain. Authorities say Spain remains under constant threat from Islamic terrorism. Al Qaeda reports regularly mention Spain -- among other countries -- as a target, and more than 300 suspected Islamic extremists have been arrested in the country since the bombings. Besides the train bombing trial, a separate trial concluded last month with the convictions of 20 men, mainly Algerians and Moroccans, for Islamic terrorist activity in Spain. In another case, a judge held in prison for investigation 10 men, mainly Pakistanis, who were arrested last January in Barcelona on suspicion of planning al-Qaeda style attacks in Spain, Germany, France, Britain and Portugal.

242,"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Mercedes Gorden remembers August 1, 2007, like it was yesterday. Mercedes Gorden was driving home from work on the Interstate 35 West bridge when it suddenly collapsed. ""I remember everything. I remember it being sunny and hot. I had my window down,"" Gorden said. ""The next thing I knew, the concrete started to wave in front of me."" It was a normal day. Or so she thought. She was driving home from work on the Interstate 35 West bridge that spans the Mississippi River when it started to buckle and collapse during the evening rush-hour traffic. ""The bridge pulled apart in front of me ... and I went sliding,"" Gorden said. Without warning, cars careened into the Mississippi River below and Gorden's Ford Escort plummeted about 60 feet down into the river bank. ""I said I will not die on that bridge. I am not going to die today,"" Gorden, 31, said. ""This is not the way I am going to go."" She was trapped for more than an hour and rescue workers had to cut her out of the car. All of the bones in her legs were shattered and her spine was fractured. Nine surgeries and countless hours of physical therapy later, she knows it could have been worse. Thirteen people died that day and 100 others were injured. One year after the tragedy, many Minnesotans and commuters around the country wonder if their bridges and highways are safe.  Watch: Are U.S. roads and bridges safe? » . The answer is: Maybe. Across the United States, there are about 600,000 bridges. The Federal Highway Administration reported in 2006 that one quarter of the nation's bridges were at risk. The American Society for Civil Engineers said in 2006 that it would cost nearly $10 billion every year for the next two decades to fix them. But the funds used to repair and maintain the country's bridges and highways are drying up. Some of the money comes from the Highway Trust Fund, which Americans pay for through taxes on gasoline. Faced with higher gas prices, more commuters are carpooling, taking mass transit or driving less, about 4 percent less in May alone compared with a year ago.  Interactive: Check troubled bridges in your state » . The federal Department of Transportation predicted taxes will fall far short of what's needed for improvement projects -- leaving many projects delayed or even canceled. Ryan Toohey, a lead strategist with America Moving Forward, a group that lobbies for private investment to fix the nation's infrastructure problems, said nearly every state is facing a budget crisis and doesn't have the money to solve problems. ""When I hear that many states have close to a majority of their bridges deemed obsolete or structurally deficient, that scares me and I think that finding ways to help remedy those problems that simultaneously relieve states of the burden financially is very, very important and should be a welcome trend in the United States,"" Toohey said. The Bush administration projected that at some point in the next fiscal year, after October 1, 2008, the highway account will hit zero, down from $8 billion at the start of the fiscal year. Payments for repairs can't be made if the money isn't there. U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said, ""Without a doubt, our federal approach to transportation is broken"" and ""it is time for a new, a different and a better approach."" Peters said one short-term solution may be for the Highway Trust Fund to borrow from the Mass Transit Fund. But she said it wouldn't be easy to get congressional approval. The House has passed a resolution to inject $8 billion into the Trust Fund, but even if the Senate passed it, President Bush has threatened to veto the measure. Some states, such as Minnesota, are trying to get creative in raising money for road projects. ""We are looking at mileage-based revenue structures where people could be taxed based on the miles they travel. We are looking at private sector investments,"" said Minnesota's Transportation Commissioner Tom Sorel. The Minnesota legislature has passed a package of tax increases to raise $6.6 billion to improve the states' roads and bridges. Even after the Minneapolis bridge collapse, not all the bridges in the state are structurally safe. In fact, on July 26, chunks of concrete weighing about 1,200 pounds fell from an overpass in St. Paul, just a few miles from the Minneapolis scene. CNN has learned that bridge was rated ""structurally deficient"" 23 years ago, in 1985, and the Minnesota Department of Transportation confirmed it was rated ""structurally deficient"" again in 2007, just days after the Minneapolis bridge collapsed. Still, the state said it was safe to drive on. Nobody was hurt in the St. Paul bridge incident, but critics like Rep. Jim Oberstar, a Democrat from Minnesota, are demanding action. ""You would have thought the state learned its lesson and done a better job of inspecting the bridges and overpasses, yet this was one they failed to accurately assess ... It was like a meteor falling to the ground,"" said Oberstar, who is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Sorel said bridges now are supposed to be shut immediately if there is any risk. His department has inspected 1 in 5 of the more than 20,000 bridges across the state and closed at least six. The state also said it has spent $390 million on repairing and replacing its bridges since 2003. Is that enough? Not for victims like Gorden, who drives by the site of the collapse every week on her way to physical therapy. She wonders how sales taxes can be found to subsidize a new baseball stadium in Minneapolis -- but not for bridges. ""I say how did we get money for stadiums? How did we get money for all these new stadiums we're building?"" Gorden said. ""What's more important: baseball or safe traveling? Should we all be afraid every time we cross a bridge now?""","Mercedes Gorden was driving across the I-35W bridge when it collapsed in 2007 .

243,"(CNN) -- Ever since a devastating earthquake struck Haiti on January 12 followed by others in Chile, Baja California and Indonesia, many people have asked the question, ""Are earthquakes getting worse?"" The answer is a firm and unequivocal ""No."" I know it's hard to believe given the devastation these earthquakes have caused and the intense level of media attention they have received. However, it turns out that large earthquake frequency has not changed at all over the last 20 years. But don't take my word for it. Go to the United States Geological Survey website and see for yourself. As of April 25, 2010 is on pace to have approximately 18 earthquakes larger than a magnitude 7 on the Richter Scale. That sure sounds like a lot, but it's only one more than last year and very close to the 15.4 large earthquakes per year that Earth has averaged over the last 20 years. Of course, some years are more active than others, but that is to be expected. In fact, in 1995 there were 20 of these large earthquakes, but nobody talks about that year as being particularly lively. The fact that several of this year's large earthquakes occurred near populated areas only adds to the perception that the overall frequency or intensity of earthquakes has increased. Before the earthquake in Haiti, there hadn't been an earthquake of that size in over two months. This ebb and flow of earthquakes is completely natural. And what about volcanic eruptions? USGS records show they have also remained constant since the 1960s, with between 50 and 70 eruptions each year. Over the last few days, another misconception began to emerge when CNN published an opinion article by author Alan Weisman titled ""Is the Earth striking back?"" The piece outlined a theory that, as glaciers melt due to global warming, the Earth's crust will begin to stretch and rebound. It goes on to imply that this stretching could cause not only earthquakes, such as in Haiti and Chile, but also volcanic eruptions. The article even suggests this process is responsible for the recent eruption of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland with its neighbor, Katla. ""threatening to detonate next."" Do these studies exist? Yes. Is this really what they say? No. First, some background. The source of this idea is a series of papers published by the Royal Society in England that looked at the potential effect of climate change on some types of natural disasters. This idea is generally based on the well-known phenomenon that, as Earth's glaciers continue to melt, the crust rebounds as it is relieved of the burden. In fact, this has been happening for thousands of years since the peak of the last ice age. Several of these papers did propose that climate change could affect certain types of earthquakes on the ocean floor or underneath melting glaciers, however, Haiti is neither on the bottom of the ocean nor under a glacier. As for the Chilean quake, it was caused by the incredible amount of pressure generated as two tectonic plates are forced together. The point is that not all earthquakes are caused by the same forces and earthquakes on the ocean floor or under glaciers could not be more different from earthquakes in Haiti or Chile. It's like saying cigarettes cause lung cancer, therefore they cause skin cancer as well. The bottom line is that Weisman's claims that earthquake frequency is increasing and that earthquakes in Haiti and Chile are caused by global warming are unsupported by the scientific articles he uses to form his conclusions. The effect of his article is to take several well-meaning, preliminary, cautious and limited scientific studies and create unnecessary fear and confusion in the general public. If the public concludes that earthquake frequency has increased, it will be wrong. If it concludes that volcano eruption frequency or intensity has increased, it will be wrong. If it believes that earthquakes in Haiti or Chile were caused by global warming, it will not only be wrong, but it will believe it because it was told it was the conclusion of geologists. It wasn't. Most scientific papers do not lend themselves to sound bites or headlines. That means the media needs to do a much better job understanding them. For their part, scientists need to be willing to confront these errors before they spread. Whatever effect climate change has on our planet in the future, inaccurate reporting of research leaves the public at a huge disadvantage and cannot be tolerated. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ian Saginor.","Ian Saginor says many people have asked if there's an increase in earthquakes .
He says quakes, volcanoes are occurring at average level .
Saginor says the Haiti, Chile, Iceland events are not related to global warming .
Only a certain class of quakes might be affected by melting ice sheets, he says .",122 302 105 1 2488 5795 1209 9649 8 414 266 790 15 313 4 6271 26216 846 3 5936 106 62 19 224 0 774 28 12435 325 1344 0 1332 10 1 1021 3 20104 61 46 143 13 7 393 2 270 240 0 6598 134 12435 19 592 3 0 2621 676 5 389 795 30 19 450 185 13 2424 40 11 487 5795 8660 20 26 867 12 49 56 0 55 226 75 18 138 47 113 104 1324 6 13 130 2 0 259 323 10358 1985 591 3 127 6 2252 16 5 577 467 518 10 8 2921 2 19 3178 402 12435 1983 60 1 8000 482 8 0 29394 2250 11 470 2939 84 1 276 18 13 7 80 35 45 60 55 79 3 107 320 2 0 292 343 487 12435 338 79 11 1746 20 13854 56 0 55 226 75 5 540 76 75 28 45 1892 60 313 18 11 10 2 22 405 4 437 4 3555 48 37 226 5 134 487 12435 18 1946 1477 44 11 79 16 74 873 9043 0 437 11 247 5 24 79 7 487 12435 1319 299 7770 815 80 2258 2 0 5987 11 0 1793 8660 50 6601 5 12435 20 1385 65 0 5795 4 9649 48 2329 47 29 23 5795 5 11 1310 4 56 51 193 24 23580 3 3882 5 12435 10 931 1257 3 64 44 11612 17965 24687 1286 199 30 19 41 1271 2997 105 0 4005 9 136 464 3 1377 17965 236 79 56 0 55 218 172 119 21306 335 2 5049 36 122 147 23 1431 1517 15 1951 2564 87469 4883 10 0 1746 3033 88 0 1353 6798 1 3364 11 16 18642 11128 381 2 1085 6585 0 1746 7 18552 42 1335 2 3482 3 13219 13 805 8 2 16323 11 24 7345 72 639 26 80 12435 132 16 4 9649 3 6271 18 41 11612 17965 0 1517 101 1906 24 660 10 1028 6 0 346 14734 5 54861 4 9766 9 86 3684 171813 2416 2 15935 153 89 134 2002 3441 1375 10 24 204 64 30 123 61 69 76 2156 0 910 5 24 669 10 1 609 5 3287 147 15 0 1006 1098 4 546 11 567 12 0 785 1143 5 3216 394 8 76 2835 5 1257 7907 24 669 10 2508 571 8 0 4074 4993 11 16 1746 7 18642 499 2 11128 0 18552 26661 16 13 10 4740 5 0 4835 4 437 24 20 29 1835 6 574 5 75 105 0 3442 5 0 55 2357 537 247 5 134 3287 116 9563 11 3216 394 72 2270 1011 2835 5 12435 8 0 2536 1159 50 4595 10798 18642 185 9649 10 1900 8 0 1484 5 0 2536 1844 140 1 15122 16 6 0 10955 11371 13 14 592 15 0 1630 927 5 801 4840 16 51 29675 6868 28 580 349 0 326 10 11 26 49 12435 28 592 15 0 179 878 3 12435 8 0 2536 1159 50 140 18642 72 26 22 45 322 17 12435 4 9649 50 6271 13 7 84 223 6859 639 5562 1606 2360 30 639 1973 1606 16 124 0 1484 530 10 11 87469 7 481 11 5795 8660 10 2011 3 11 12435 4 9649 3 6271 28 592 15 1085 6585 28 31887 15 0 3595 7126 27 1708 2 697 33 7182 0 1143 5 33 1517 10 2 113 247 25710 4199 7169 3 1614 3595 2002 3 900 5133 1038 3 4868 4 0 576 200 63 0 200 9562 11 5795 8660 20 1385 13 42 22 696 63 13 9562 11 12125 14734 8660 50 6601 20 1385 13 42 22 696 63 13 854 11 12435 4 9649 50 6271 37 592 15 1085 6585 13 42 26 80 22 696 18 13 42 270 13 82 13 14 67 13 14 0 3630 5 25677 13 483 47 96 3595 3287 89 26 9739 612 2 1744 9738 50 3107 11 547 0 389 707 2 89 1 133 305 460 2353 73 6 34 144 1696 215 2 22 1976 2 6127 134 6059 65 30 1432 1552 1143 3216 394 20 8 110 2971 4 0 440 9480 2677 5 721 1866 0 200 12 1 573 14228 3 682 22 9327 0 2085 1101 4 24 2432 28 2180 118 5 2706 122308,c38de2e8f3e446f78dbb42a571c73aba759a99d1,
244,"(CNN) -- As Gulf Coast residents wait for a huge oil slick to reach their shores, the spill and the massive response already have begun wreaking havoc on livelihoods in a region where jobs are largely dependent on two ocean intensive industries: seafood and tourism. Stephen Denmark, a city council member in Dauphin Island, Alabama, said Saturday that local scientists are predicting that the seafood crop could take a decade to recover from the oil slick. ""The last two years have been tough already,"" Denmark said, referring to the recession. ""This will be catastrophic to the mom-and-pop businesses, which is 90 percent of the business down here on the island."" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Saturday that heavy oil is likely to begin hitting the state's coast by Sunday or Monday. U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen -- the Obama administration's national incident commander for the slick -- said Saturday that oil also is likely to reach shorelines in Mississippi and Alabama in coming days. But some Gulf Coast oyster beds and other seafood harvesting grounds are already awash in oil, according to Casi Callaway, executive director of the Alabama-based environmental group Mobile Baykeeper. ""It's already covering shrimp beds and shrimp grounds in the Gulf,"" she said. ""So it's here and it's now and it's happening."" Callaway said that the oil could ruin oyster beds for up to two decades. Forty percent of the fish harvested in the lower 48 states comes from the Gulf of Mexico. Vacationers, meanwhile, spend billions of dollars every year in the region. But this week, many Americans canceled plans to travel to the Gulf Coast over the summer. ""I'm pretty much on pause right now ... it's just a big waiting game,"" said David Boola, a fisherman who leads boat trips out of Venice, Louisiana. ""I'm extremely worried because I have customers that [have] already canceled trips,"" Boola said Saturday. ""I should be out taking people fishing today and I'm not. I'm not making money today. Or tomorrow. I'm worried about the 'now' factor, you know?"" Besides the oil, the deployment of hundreds of thousands of feet of floating booms along the Gulf Coast to protect sensitive land areas has kept many fishing boats tied up at the dock. In Florida's Panhandle, where Saturday was the deadline for tourists to cancel summer plans at many hotels, phones were ringing off the hook. ""In the hurricane season, you know you can't stop the hurricane, but you can prepare ... and we're great at that,"" said Jewel Cannada-Wynn, deputy mayor of Pensacola, Florida. ""But how do we deal with an oil spill? It's a helpless feeling."" Blows to seafood and tourism are likely to be felt in other industries in the Gulf Coast and beyond. ""It affects the people that truck it, the people that make the ice, the people that [provide] fuel -- the labor just to transport it is just monumental,"" said Denmark, describing the long chain of workers involved in harvesting and shipping seafood. ""It's not just the people that catch it and process it.""","Spill and response already have taken toll on seafood, tourism industries .

245,"(CNN) -- Young, athletic and troubled -- NFL player Chris Henry might have been a football cliché. After being arrested four times, suspended by the league three times and released once by the Cincinnati Bengals, the wide receiver appeared to be on a personal and professional comeback. But all that ended in December 2009. Henry died after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fiancée. His death was considered a tragic and bizarre end to a life plagued by behavioral problems. This week, findings from Henry's brain examination reverberated through the sports world, raising questions about head injuries and safety in high-contact sports. Doctors found evidence of brain damage, called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, that has been observed in retired players who've had many concussions. Unlike those older players, Henry was 26 when he died. CTE is also known as dementia pugilistica, because career boxers who've suffered repeated blows to the head have been known to develop the syndrome. Sudden stops and collisions can cause the brain to slosh inside the skull. Its effects are mainly neurobehavioral. These symptoms include poor decision-making, behavioral problems, failure at personal and business relationships, use of drugs and alcohol, depression and suicide. ""The effect on the brain appears to be damages to the emotional circuitry of the brain,"" said Dr. Julian Bailes, chairman of neurosurgery at West Virginia University. ""We think Chris exhibited some of the characteristics of the neurobehavioral syndrome of CTE,"" he said at a news conference Monday. ""We don't know if there is a cause and effect."" The neurologists at the Brain Injury Research Institute at West Virginia University did not draw any association between Henry's actions and the disease. ""His case highlights the fact there is documented damage in someone young and actively playing,"" said Bailes, a former doctor for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Bengals coach: Henry 'beacon of hope' before death . The syndrome is believed to be caused by large accumulations of tau proteins in the brain that kill cells in the regions responsible for mood, emotion and executive functioning. Tau proteins are also found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The findings regarding Henry's brain raised unsettling questions: Could CTE contribute to misbehavior of football players? If Henry, a seemingly healthy athlete in his mid-20s, had signs of CTE, could other young athletes have this syndrome, too? Dr. Jon Weingart, professor of neurological surgery and oncology at Johns Hopkins University, said extrapolating from one case, like Henry's, would be a ""big leap."" ""That would be misleading,"" he said. ""There's not enough data. ... To think that this is something brewing in many players -- there's no data to support that statement."" Weingart said the relationship between multiple traumas and head hits and CTE is not a proven cause and effect. At this point, it's a correlation. Sports Illustrated: Concussions and football: Is the game too dangerous for our kids? In 2009, the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at the Boston University School of Medicine reported that an 18-year-old multisport athlete who suffered multiple concussions also had CTE,  a finding that a neuropathologist described as ""shocking."" MRIs and CAT scans are unable to detect CTE. Detecting the syndrome requires brain samples, which cannot be given until a person is dead. The samples are colored with special microscopic stains. In Henry's brain, doctors found a tau protein accumulation, inflammatory changes and white matter changes that were significantly abnormal. The fibers in the brain had brown discoloration and showed significant damage. In previous findings of former NFL players, the brown tangles flecked throughout the brain tissue resembled what might be found in the brain of an 80-year-old with dementia. Dead athletes' brains show damage from concussions . Henry could've had a genetic predisposition for the type of brain injury, because a majority of the brains with CTE contained the gene called the apolipoprotein E3 allele. ""We may be seeing a genetic trend that Chris is in the 70 percent of those diagnosed with CTE, who have a special genetic sign,"" said Bailes, the West Virginia University neurosurgery chairman. ""Perhaps that may be a clue as to who's at risk for this to develop."" Genetic factors could make some people less able to tolerate subtle trauma to their brains. For example, some high school athletes get a concussion and struggle afterward, while others who experience the same degree of head bump recover without a hitch. ""There's some variability of how someone is able to handle and recover from trauma to the brain,"" Weingart said. Henry's case has ""sparked a lot of social debate and reflection and was scientifically valuable,"" Bailes said. ""We want to continue to study. We don't have all the answers. We're also looking, as soon as we can, to find treatment and prevention,"" he said. NFL medical heads and Goodell convene on brain injuries . The NFL has recently pledged to step up its efforts on head injuries and named new co-chairs and members to its medical committee. The league has also changed guidelines prohibiting a player suffering a concussion to practice or play.","NFL star Chris Henry was found to have a type of brain damage seen in older players .

246,"South Padre Island, Texas (CNN) -- Heavy rains pelting northeastern Mexico left at least one person dead and thousands more in shelters as Hurricane Alex moved inland, Mexican emergency officials said early Thursday. A contractor in Monterrey died when a wall fell on him as a result of the rain, Carlos Eduardo Aguilar of Nuevo Leon's Civil Protection agency said. CNN-affiliate Televisa reported that at least three other people died when a wall collapsed on them in Acapulco, on the country's Pacific coast. Alex made landfall along the northeast Mexican coastline late Wednesday as a Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of about 100 mph, the National Hurricane Center reported. Forecasters downgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane early Thursday morning and said it would continue to weaken as it moved inland. The center reported at 5 a.m. ET that Alex was weakening, but still a Category 1 hurricane, moving west at 12 mph with 80 mph maximum sustained winds. Residents on both sides of the border braced for additional flooding and tornadoes. Rivers and creeks were already well above their normal levels Wednesday. Rescuers saved a young man from rushing waters, Nuevo Leon state officials said. Officials closed schools across the state Thursday as they braced for floods. Heavy rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides, especially in areas with mountainous terrain, the National Hurricane Center said. Are you affected by Alex? Send photos, video . Power outages were reported throughout the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, where shelters were housing more than 5,200 people Thursday morning, Salvador Treviño Salinas of the state's Civil Protection agency said. At least 1,500 people were in shelters in the city of Matamoros -- located across the border from Brownsville, Texas -- where flash floods inundated at least 48 neighborhoods after more than 14 inches of rain fell in 24 hours, he said. The storm also affected other Mexican states Wednesday. In Guadalajara, Jalisco, the water reached more than three feet in some streets, Televisa reported. Heavy rains from Alex were also expected to hit the Mexican states of Veracruz, Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas Thursday. In Brownsville, Texas, about 40 streets had flooded by early Thursday morning, Assistant City Manager Jeff Johnston said. Officials predict that the city could see up to 12 inches of rain from the storm, he said -- a significant amount, but less than originally feared. ""We're keeping a very close eye on the rain,"" he said. ""Brownsville is a very flat city...When we get a significat amount of rain in a short period of time, it's very difficult to move that water out of the city fast."" At least 1,000 people in southern Texas were taking shelter in evacuation centers as Alex's winds and heavy rain squalls bore down on the coastline, officials in Cameron and Hidalgo counties reported. Brownsville appeared to be taking the brunt of Alex's outer bands Wednesday after as many as six tornadoes were reported in the area and about 4,000 customers lost power, officials said. But by Thursday morning, all but 60 customers were back on the grid, Johnston said. In Harlingen, just 30 miles north of Brownsville, wind gusts of up to 65 mph were reported hours before the storm's expected landfall. No injuries were immediately reported from the twisters near Brownsville, but some damage was reported, including downed trees and power lines, weather and emergency management officials said. Carol Rumsey was riding the storm out in her Los Fresnos, Texas, home, not far from Brownsville and about a half hour from the coast. She told CNN Radio on Wednesday night that her house had an eerie feel as the storm approached. ""You board up your windows and it's like living in a dungeon,"" she said. ""You can't hear anything, you can't see anything."" She said she had considered evacuating as the region was being pummeled by heavy rain and occasional gusts of wind, but said ""this is the price you pay for living in paradise."" Meanwhile, authorities in South Padre Island closed the Queen Isabella Memorial Bridge -- which crosses to the popular vacation spot -- as a precaution ahead of the approaching Alex. Tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 205 miles from the center of the storm and hurricane force winds extend outward up to 35 miles, according to the hurricane center. Heavy rain and thunderstorms associated with the outer bands of Alex were affecting the entire Gulf Coast from Texas to Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. Brownsville received more than 4 inches of rain by Wednesday afternoon, the weather service said. Harlingen Assistant Fire Chief Cirilo Rodriguez said his region was expecting 7-10 inches of rain. Coastal flood advisories have been issued for Louisiana and Mississippi. Minor coastal flooding is expected along the shore due to a prolonged strong southeasterly wind caused by the large counterclockwise circulation of the hurricane. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Wednesday that the state was prepared for the storm. The State Operations Center was fully activated, he said, and Texas was working with federal and local authorities to track the hurricane and the BP Gulf oil disaster. President Barack Obama issued a federal emergency declaration for Texas ahead of Alex's expected arrival, the White House said Tuesday night. After the hurricane made landfall around 9 p.m. CT (10 p.m. ET), forecasters from the National Hurricane Center changed the hurricane warning to a tropical storm warning for the coast of Texas south of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande. A tropical storm warning issued earlier remained in place along the Texas coast from Baffin Bay to Port O'Connor. A hurricane warning was in place for the coast of Mexico from the mouth of the Rio Grande to La Cruza, Mexico. The storm continued to move away from the massive BP oil catastrophe near the Louisiana coast in the northern Gulf of Mexico, but it already was complicating cleanup efforts. Residual effects from the storm will last for at least four days, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said, and could prohibit skimming and burning of oil in the Gulf at least until Saturday or Sunday. The storm created 12-foot waves Tuesday and oil-skimming ships were sent to shore from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. The rough seas may force crews to replace and reorganize booms meant to deter the oil from reaching shore, reported CNN's Ed Lavandera. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist said that even though Florida may dodge any problems with this storm, the Atlantic hurricane season is just beginning. ""In Florida, we've had a lot of hurricanes a number of years ago, but we handled them very well,"" he told CNN's Campbell Brown. ""The difference and the distinction that we face now is that we have a Gulf of Mexico that's full of oil. So our hope and our prayer is that we don't have a mixture of hurricanes with oil that could potentially damage the beautiful beaches of Florida. But if we do, we're prepared for it."" Pat Ahumada, the mayor of Brownsville, said the city was expecting to distribute 60,000 sandbags and provide shelter for roughly 2,000 families. Utility crews were on standby to handle outages. At the same time, the state government provided 90 buses in case an evacuation is needed. ""I expect about 10 percent of residents to evacuate voluntarily, which already started yesterday,"" Ahumada said Tuesday. ""I see a steady flow of people going out, but no bottlenecks -- which is good. ""We're not taking it lightly,"" he said. ""We're ready for a worst-case scenario.""

247,"(CNN) -- After a severe earthquake centered in Pakistan's Kashmir province killed more than 70,000 people in 2005, teams from a nonprofit architecture group based in London, England, helped the region start to rebuild. The group, Article 25, worked with local craftspeople to develop a design that could withstand earthquakes and trained them to build the structures. That experience may provide some lessons for the rebuilding of Haiti, where Article 25 is also planning to help with reconstruction, according to Robin Cross, an architect who is the organization's director of projects. As in Haiti, at least some of the death and injury in Pakistan stemmed from local building methods. ""The important point is that it isn't generally earthquakes that kill people,"" Cross said. ""It's generally buildings that kill people. Building design is a way to solve that problem."" In Pakistan, Article 25 worked with local craftspeople to determine the best way to build structures that could withstand quakes and then helped train people to build them. ""By the time we built 80 to 100 buildings and we pulled out, we were leaving not just buildings, but also a capacity to build,"" Cross said. ""Each building we built there was the site of a training exercise for a team of workers -- concrete workers, carpenters, roofers, plasterers,"" said Cross. ""They have obviously been able to take these skills away. In the long run the idea was that we would do ourselves out of a job."" Cross spoke to CNN on January 29. CNN: What is the role of architects in planning the rebuilding of Haiti, based on your experience in Pakistan? Robin Cross: At this point, the focus is rightly on relief, and the provision of water, food and medical care, the basic life support system. ... What we won't be doing is clogging up that quite strained delivery system with the bricks and mortar of longer-term reconstruction. But there is going to come a point very shortly when minds need to turn to longer-term construction planning, and that's where architects and engineers have a role to play. Our work in Pakistan began quite soon after the earthquake. But the important factor is that it's still ongoing, that we need to be there for the long run. ... What we were doing there was working with local NGOs [non-governmental organizations], particularly with Muslim Aid, to identify the most vulnerable members of the community who could most benefit from our architectural and design skills, and couldn't afford to buy in their own construction expertise, and would be most marginalized and vulnerable in the future. So we worked with Muslim Aid to develop a series of earthquake-resistant buildings which could then be delivered on a range of different sites. We put people in the field to provide quality assurance, to make sure that the buildings that were built would be earthquake-resistant. After a disaster there's an enormous demand for reconstruction, a demand for materials, designers, particularly builders -- so they will tend to be drawn very rapidly into high-value commercial work, which could leave less financially strong people without access to building skills. That could lead to them building in a poor and unsafe way, so you get into a very dangerous cycle of vulnerability. By building the capacity of local work teams to build, you enable people to build for themselves and break that cycle of vulnerability. CNN: What kind of buildings did you build? Cross: We were intent on providing an earthquake-resistant home design. ... The buildings are a lightweight frame construction, which means they are able to flex in the event of an earthquake. We adopted the dhaji dewari technique, an indigenous technique developed out of the materials in that landscape. We adapted it and improved its details to make it more earthquake-resistant. ... CNN: How much do these houses cost? Cross: Approximately £4,000 [about $6,300 at current rates] per house. That compares very well with the equivalent house in concrete block, which would normally be used. It isn't just safer than a concrete-block equivalent but it's also more economical and it's quicker to deliver. CNN: What's it made of? Cross: It's made of lightweight timber frame with many cross-facing elements, and the gaps between cross-facing elements are infilled with stones and mud and then rendered over with mud. What that generates is a design which flexes when the earthquake strikes, the energy of the earthquake is dissipated through the many framing elements of the building, and the energy is lost in the friction between the timber and the stone infill. ... A concrete-block building which isn't able to flex is more apt to collapse. ... The other thing that's worth mentioning is that the buildings have a lightweight roof. In the worst eventuality, if the roof collapses, if it's lightweight, it's much less likely to kill people. ... CNN: What similarities are there between the building styles in Pakistan and Haiti? Cross: I haven't yet been to Haiti, and we'll be undertaking our first visit as soon as conditions really allow that to happen, which I think will be in February or early March. But what I think we will find is that there will be an equivalent vernacular tradition in Haiti from which we can learn a lot. I'm sure the problem that we saw in Pakistan is shared in Haiti -- in that concrete buildings have been built poorly, without adequate technical supervision, and have proved very vulnerable to the earthquake. A good architect will never decide at a distance what the right technical approach would be, because it's always important to understand the location. ... So when we go to Haiti, the first thing we will do will be to carry out participation workshops with the local communities, to carry out a needs assessment but also a skills assessment ... so we design the right buildings, appropriate to the materials available and the skills that are present. CNN: It's still early, but how do you assess the need in Haiti compared to the need in Pakistan? Cross: All of the information we have at the moment suggests that the need is even greater in Haiti. In Pakistan, the earthquake did enormous damage, but there was still a strong national government, relatively strong local government and a strong military presence in the Pakistan army with which we could collaborate. In Haiti those institutions were already weak and in many cases have been destroyed by the earthquake. The partnerships which we would look to build with local governments may be much harder. ... There's likely to be an even greater role for strong strategic planning and long-term thinking from architects. ... I should say that you should never see Haiti as a blank slate. You look at the images, you think the damage is so great, it's a clean sweep -- but you should never see it as a blank canvas on which to impose a master plan from London or North America. There remains in Haiti a social infrastructure, an economic infrastructure, even in the slum areas there's an economically vibrant infrastructure. It's those threads of the community infrastructure that we need to find and build a new Haiti around. So all of our work starts with community participation and is part of empowering the local community and making sure that what we design is compatible with their objectives. ... One of the big problems immediately after this kind of disaster is the lack of long-term investment. The funding for short-term relief is good and is needed, but very often at the point of about a year, that funding just falls off a cliff. That's what I'm hoping will be improved on in the Haiti response.","Earthquake centered in Kashmir region of Pakistan killed more than 70,000 in 2005 .

248,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- More oil than what would fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool slipped by the cap on BP's ruptured undersea well due to bad weather on Friday, said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft. The cap on the well in the Gulf of Mexico, bouncing in the rough conditions, captured 20,000 barrels (840,000 gallons) fewer than anticipated, Zukunft said. Bad weather has also prevented skimming or burning for the past two days, displaced boom and made it unsafe to fly, he said. Crews are standing by to resume skimming operations and survey inland waterways that may have seen impacts due to a storm surge. Shoreline cleanup operations continue with limited weather interruption. For the 12-hour period from noon Thursday until midnight, approximately 9,515 barrels of oil were collected and about 4,150 barrels of oil and 28.6 million cubic feet of natural gas were flared. Thursday's total oil recovered was approximately 25,150 barrels. High winds account for the cap's ""wobble,"" said Mark Proegler, a BP spokesman. He noted that forecasters expect rough seas to calm a bit this weekend. The oil is more likely to move east than west along the coastline and, if it rides on the Loop Current, could reach the southwestern Florida coast in a degraded form, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in a report released Friday. The Loop Current flows northward between Cuba and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico, then U-turns and flows out between Cuba and Florida into the Atlantic Ocean. NOAA predicts that there's up to an 80 percent that the Florida Keys, Miami and Fort Lauderdale will be affected by the disaster, depending on the weather conditions, currents and recovery efforts. It would reach the shore in the form of tar balls or weathered patches -- not as a slick. The western side of Florida is highly unlikely to be hit, NOAA projected. Hurricane Alex whipped up strong winds and waves before it made landfall in northeastern Mexico late Wednesday night. With Alex fading, many in the Gulf states were hoping they could get back to cleaning up the massive oil spill. The dangerous storm had created choppy seas in the Gulf of Mexico and caused hundreds of oil skimmers to be docked. ""We had to stand down because of the storm activity. Now that oil has been spewed all over the Chandeleur Islands,"" Craig Taffaro, the president of St. Bernard Parish in Louisiana, said Thursday. ""We are going out again tomorrow to start cleaning it up. We have to go back out, basically start over."" Newly retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen announced Friday that since June, the skimming capability in the Gulf has increased more than fivefold -- from approximately 100 large skimmers to 550 skimming vessels of various sizes working to collect oil in all parts of the region as of today.To date, 28.2 million gallons of an oil-water mix has been skimmed from the Gulf's surface. Shoreline cleanup operations continued Friday with limited weather interruption. The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa P. Jackson, planned to tour parts of the Gulf Coast on Friday, a day after her agency gave BP a new directive on how to deal with the clean-up of the massive oil spill. Jackson will hold a town hall meeting in New Orleans and tour areas of Pensacola, Florida, on Friday, which is her sixth trip to the area since the April 20 oil disaster, the EPA said. On Thursday, the EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard issued a directive to BP on how the company should manage recovered oil, contaminated materials and waste recovered in cleanup operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Among other requirements, the directive requires the oil giant to give the EPA and state agencies access to any waste storage site and to provide specific plans, waste reports and tracking systems for liquid and solid waste. ""While the states of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida are overseeing BP's waste management activities and conducting inspections, this action today is meant to complement their activities by providing further oversight and imposing more specific requirements,"" the Coast Guard said Thursday. ""Under the directive, EPA, in addition to sampling already being done by BP, will begin sampling the waste to help verify that the waste is being properly managed."" Waste sampling to date has been done in compliance with EPA and state regulatory requirements, the Coast Guard said. Researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels (about 1.5 million gallons) and 60,000 barrels (about 2.5 million gallons) of oil have been gushing into the Gulf every day since April 20, when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank off the coast of Louisiana.","NEW: Containment cap bounced, allowing 20,000 barrels to get by .

249,"New York (CNN) -- A bedbug outbreak at two trendy New York retail shops has sounded the alarm among city residents and businesses, prompting calls for the city to examine how it deals with the prickly pests. Hollister, a popular clothing store owned by Abercrombie & Fitch in the fashionable Soho neighborhood, remained closed Friday after a bedbug infestation was found earlier in the week, according to company spokeswoman Iska Hain. And an Abercrombie & Fitch store in South Street Seaport also has been closed by an infestation. Abercrombie and Fitch said Friday afternoon the problem in the SoHo Hollister store had been taken care of and the shop will reopen Saturday morning. ""The company has requested guidance from the mayor's office on how businesses in Manhattan should deal with this issue,"" the company said in a news release. ""In the meantime, the company's first priority continues to be its customers and associates."" The incidents mirror a sharp overall spike in bedbugs in recent years, yet efforts to combat the problem have mostly focused on residential buildings, leaving the issue of contamination in commercial spaces largely ignored. ""We've had them in banks, grocery stores, movie theaters, judge's chambers, schools, dentists' offices -- everywhere,"" said Jeff Eisenberg of PestAway, an exterminating company in Manhattan. The problem, according to Eisenberg, is that bedbugs carry a stigma, which causes many cases to go unreported. ""It's like a don't ask, don't tell policy,"" he said. ""People don't tell their employers that they have bedbugs in their house"" -- bedbugs that can hitch a ride to the workplace. According to the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, it issued 4,811 violation notices to residential landlords for bedbug infestations in 2009, compared with 82 in the 2003-2004 fiscal year. For the first half of 2010, 1,976 bedbug violation notices have already been written. However, such statistics represent only a fraction of bedbug cases in the city, as they come almost exclusively from buildings in the rental market. Owners of bedbug-infested residences are less likely to call 311, the city's non-emergency hotline, which then notifies the Housing Preservation Department. Further, landlords of commercial structures are currently not obligated to report bedbug infestation. State Assembly member Linda B. Rosenthal, who recently sponsored legislation to require landlords of apartment buildings to disclose information about an apartment's bedbug history to potential tenants, plans to address the matter of bedbugs in businesses, though she admits doing so will be tricky. ""People buy a shirt, leave it hanging in their apartment, a bug gets on it, and then they go to work."" Rosenthal told CNN. ""If you buy a piece of clothing you should assume it's bug free, but it's hard on the retailer to assure that it is, because how would they know."" Treating bedbugs can be extremely expensive, and no insurance policies cover them. ""It would be cost prohibitive on both sides,"" Rosenthal said. The rise in bedbug cases is not exclusive to New York. Last year, the federal Environmental Protection Agency sponsored a bedbug conference in Arlington, Virginia. Speaking to a crowd of 230 academics, agency employees and exterminators, Dale Kemery, an agency spokesman, said the incidence of infestation in the United States has tripled since 2005. Despite their name, bedbugs need not live in beds. They generally live within 10 to 20 feet of their hosts and avoid light, preferring the dark security of spaces behind headboards, under baseboards and behind hanging pictures.","Bedbug infestation shuts down 2 stores in upscale Manhattan areas .

250,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Three mortar rounds struck harmlessly inside Baghdad's Green Zone on Sunday night during a weekend visit by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. and Iraqi officials said. No damage or injuries were reported from the bombardment, which occurred about 10:30 p.m. Sunday (3:30 p.m. ET). The district, formally known as the International Zone, houses Iraqi government offices and the U.S. Embassy. But there were no injuries or damage reported from the shelling, Iraqi Interior Ministry and U.S. officials told CNN. The district was a frequent target of rocket and mortar attacks during the worst of the war that followed the U.S. invasion in 2003. A similar attack struck during a Biden visit in September. Biden landed in Iraq on Saturday to celebrate the U.S. Independence Day holiday with American troops, the White House said. He also met with Iraqi political leaders, including Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and with former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, whose political coalition narrowly won an election in March. Iraqi political factions are still negotiating who will lead the new government following that vote. Biden told them after their meeting that ""you must have all voices represented in this government for it to be successful,"" and noted later that a country's second election -- not its first -- is ""the most important election in a country's history."" ""Now there's a new parliament that's been seated, and when the new government is formed, it will mark something absolutely extraordinary -- a peaceful transition of power encompassing all the people of Iraq, maybe for the first time in their history,"" Biden said during remarks Sunday at Camp Victory, the U.S. base near Baghdad's airport. And Biden said the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq will continue as scheduled, with the pullout expected to be complete by the end of August. But he said 50,000 Americans will remain to train and support Iraqi forces, and the United States will remain engaged with Iraq ""diplomatically, politically, economically, culturally (and) scientifically.""

251,"Orange Beach, Alabama (CNN) -- On Thursday evening, a boat returned to its dock without its captain -- his vibrant personality and smile gone. On the dock was a wreath memorializing the Gulf fisherman known as ""Rookie."" His family and friends say ""Rookie,"" whose real name was Allen Kruse, was stressed beyond belief by the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf. On Thursday, a coroner ruled his sudden, tragic death a suicide. Kruse, 55, a charter boat captain who had been hired by BP to help clean Gulf waterways and render them safe, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Wednesday on board one of his own vessels. ""Most definitely a suicide,"" said Rod Steade Sr., deputy coroner for Baldwin County, Alabama. ""No question about it."" Kruse shot himself with his own gun, kept on board his boat, which was also named ""Rookie."" He sent two of his deckhands on an errand before killing himself. He did not leave a note, and none of his friends suspected he would do something so extreme. ""He must have had his demons,"" said Captain Bryan Watts. For 14 days, Kruse had been using his boats to haul protective boom off of Alabama's shores, instead of captaining them on the hunt for snapper and amberjack. A charter boat fishing captain for 26 years, he -- like countless other Gulf fishermen -- found his passion and his career threatened by the undersea oil gusher. ""The day that oil entered the Gulf, my phone quit ringing,"" he said last month in a television interview. Kruse told his family that he believed the Deepwater Horizon oil spill had effectively killed his livelihood as well as the ocean. ""He just thought it was over,"" said brother Marc Kruse. ""He said, 'the Gulf's dead.' ... There was no hope that the fishing was ever going to come back ... not in his lifetime."" Marc Kruse and another brother, Frank Kruse, told CNN they believe Allen Kruse would still be alive today if he had believed he was making an impact against the oil that was threatening the waters he loved. ""If he thought they were doing something that was working, that was effective, they were making a difference, yes, but every day there was a different meeting with a different plan,"" said Frank Kruse, referring to BP's program to enlist out-of-work fishermen. Allen Kruse didn't have much choice but to join the program, his brother said -- he used to make between $5,000 and $6,000 a day chartering his two boats, income that had ceased. So, he signed his boats up for the BP program, known as ""Vessels of Opportunity."" He worked for two weeks straight, his family says, but hadn't been paid. Allen Kruse called the program ""madness,"" they said, and told relatives it was a sham. His brothers said he told them that cleanup boats were put in the water close to shore, so people would think they were making a difference. ""It's just a dog and pony show,"" said Marc Kruse. ""Send them out. Ride around. Let everybody see them. Bring them back in."" A BP spokesman did not return CNN's calls for comment. The company has repeatedly said it's doing everything it can to fund and facilitate cleanup efforts, and cap the ruptured deepwater well. Government estimates say up to 60,000 barrels oil could be gushing daily. Anxieties and frustrations are increasing among Gulf residents over the ongoing oil disaster, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The department says it's concerned about an increase in depression and the potential for more suicides. ""We're all going through a lot of stress,"" said Tom Ard, president of the Orange Beach Fishing Association and a close friend of Allen Kruse. ""Just stress, starting a new job with BP. It's something we've never done before, being in the oil business, so we've got a lot on our plate. We've all been stressed out,"" he said. And others might buckle under the strain: ""We worry about that every day,"" said Captain Ben Fairey, one of Allen Kruse's friends. ""There's a lot of people on the edge. We feel hopeless. We feel helpless. We don't feel like there's an advocate out there,"" said Tony Kennon, mayor of Orange Beach, a close-knit fishing community. ""We're bringing in and asking all the preachers and all the churches to step up and help. We have a weekly meeting at lunch on Wednesdays where we invite the entire community in for support. BP is there to ask questions. Folks vent,"" he said. ""But the big thing is we have to love each other. We've got to be there for each other. We can't let go. We can't give up."" Still, Allen Kruse's death could be about more than oil. Fairey said the past few years haven't been easy for anyone in Orange Beach. ""This has been a long-term situation,"" Fairey said. ""This started in 2004, with a direct hit from Hurricane Ivan, then the next year was Katrina, then skyrocketing fuel prices, fishing regulations, then an oil spill. This has been six years that this area has really suffered a lot of stress."" Still, nothing has hit as hard as the oil spill, which has robbed fisherman of their ability to make a living -- and now, of their friend.

252,"Rio Largo, Brazil (CNN) -- In response to severe flooding in northeastern Brazil that has left 46 people dead, the government on Thursday announced the release of 500 million reais (U.S. $277 million) to help victims, national civil defense officials said. The money comes on top of a previous 50 million reais (U.S. $27.7 million) destined for the two hardest-hit states, Pernambuco and Alagoas. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday also signed an interim measure of 1 billion reais (U.S. $555 million) to purchase construction material and equipment for businesses affected by the floods. Aid has also been pledged by the Organization of American States and the United States, which offered $50,000. The death toll from the flooding grew to 46 Thursday, and more than 150,000 people have been left homeless or displaced, according to the government-run Agencia Brasil news service. More than 600 people are still missing, the news service said, citing the nation's civil defense agency. More than 80,000 residents have been left homeless or displaced in Pernambuco state and about 74,000 have met a similar fate in Alagoas state, the news agency said. In Alagoas, more than 11,000 homes have been destroyed and another 7,000 damaged, Agencia Brasil said. Nearly 11,500 houses and 79 bridges have been damaged or destroyed in neighboring Pernambuco, the news outlet said. Twenty-nine people have lost their lives in Alagoas and more than 600 are missing, Agencia Brasil said. In Pernambuco, 17 people have died. Fifty-four cities have been affected in Pernambuco and a state of public calamity has been declared in 30. In the Alagoas city of Rio Largo, some survivors searched for the missing Wednesday. Among those who have not been found were Weltgom Melo's parents, who were dragged away by a heavy current while shopping for food. ""I only ask God for help in finding them,"" Melo told CNN. ""It's difficult. All I can do is wait for the Civil Defense and firefighters to do their job and help me find the bodies."" Cicero Aciolo lives next to the Mundau River, which cuts through Rio Largo. He had to run for his life when the water started rising quickly. ""We ran next door and we saw how the water was beginning to rise and we had to climb over walls to save our lives,"" he said. Another survivor said she barely had time to escape. ""Ten minutes,"" Marcia de Araujo said. ""Ten minutes! Ten minutes! Just enough time to leave home and reach the neighbor's house. That's how strong the flooding was."" The rain that started late last week has stopped and the enormous task of reconstruction is beginning.

253,"(CNN) -- Rescue workers Tuesday recovered the body of a child from debris left by a landslide in China's southwestern Guizhou province, state-run media reported. The child's body was the first to be recovered after a rain-triggered landslide buried 107 people from 38 families Monday afternoon. The child, yet to be identified, was found at 5:50 p.m. under rubble in Gangwu township, a rescue headquarters spokesman told the Xinhua news agency. Chances of survival for the others was ""slim,"" rescue workers said. A survivor described the mudslide's speed, which left little time to escape. ""I called the others to flee. But it was too late. I saw some people behind me being buried,"" villager Cen Chaoyang told Xinhua in a telephone interview. Rescuers had to run three miles to reach the site, which is not accessible by vehicle. Rain and landslides continue to plague the region, Xinhua said. The tourism industry has already been affected by the severe weather.

254,"(CNN) -- As Americans gear up for the Fourth of July weekend, coastal areas affected by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico are working hard to keep beach-bound travelers informed. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . A health advisory was issued Thursday for all beaches in Escambia County, including Pensacola Beach, Perdido Key and parts of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau's website. Extensive oil sheen, tar balls and mousse prompted the advisory urging visitors to avoid contact with oil on shore and in the water. The water along the Santa Rosa Sound on the north side of Santa Rosa Island remains open for swimming. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . The Okaloosa County Health Department  withdrew a health advisory issued June 24 for Destin beaches. ""The oil impacts on our beaches are intermittent and can change within hours or within a day due to the dynamic nature of the currents and changing wind directions,"" the department said in a news release rescinding the advisory. The department urges visitors to avoid entering the water when oil is present. Large amounts of oil washing ashore prompted the Walton County Health Department to issue a health advisory Wednesday for beaches in Topsail Hill State Park, according to the area's Tourist Development Council. All of the county's beaches remain open, the council's website said. Meanwhile, small, scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach, but the beaches and water are open, the area's visitors bureau website said. iReport: A slick trip to Perdido Key . Oil has not been reported onshore in the state beyond northwest Florida, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. Alabama . Stronger winds and surf from Tropical Storm Alex have increased oiling on Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""While the storm does not directly affect our area, it is having an impact on the amount of oil reaching our shores and limiting the ability for cleanup,"" the bureau's website said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan, and in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Waters off beaches flying double red flags are officially closed. Last week, the department also issued a no-swimming advisory for Dauphin Island and the Mississippi Sound. Mississippi . South Mississippi beaches experienced significant oiling on Sunday and Monday, according to the Mississippi Gulf Coast visitors bureau. Advisories have been issued for two areas along the beaches in Jackson and Harrison counties. The beaches are not closed, but state officials ""advise people to be aware of their surroundings while recreating."" Visitors should avoid contact with oil. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. But several spots have been affected by the oil spill, and a public health advisory is in effect parkwide. ""If you see or smell oil in the water or on the beach, avoid contact with water and report it to the nearest lifeguard or park ranger,"" the park service's website said. Grand Isle, Louisiana . The oil's biggest impact in Louisiana is on the portion of the coast from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east, according to a state emergency website. ""Most of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, 70 percent, is unaffected by the oil spill and remains open for commercial and recreational fishing,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website. Grand Isle has closed its public beach, the site said.","Health advisory issued for Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key beaches in Florida .

255,"LaGrange, Illinois (CNN) -- Kaley Shannon first saw the devastation in Haiti while watching the 5 o'clock news with her father. Seeing so many people in need after the January 12 earthquake, the determined girl from the Chicago suburbs wanted to help. ""When I saw those pictures, I realized those kids in Haiti didn't have a future unless someone would help them,"" said Shannon, 14. ""I knew I had to be that someone."" Shannon, who is active in her school's theater, says she got some inspiration from Hollywood. ""Brad Pitt builds houses in New Orleans, Angelina Jolie adopts kids from other countries -- that selflessness inspires me. I wanted to give people hope like they do,"" she said. Her goal was to raise $90,000 by this week, which marks 90 days since the earthquake. But to do that, she had to act quickly. She immediately called her friends at her church youth group, who were eager to help. They started brainstorming. ""We had ideas coming out in every direction,"" she said. With Valentine's Day approaching, the group decided to bake heart-shaped cookies and sell them to make money for the quake survivors. They also settled on a name for their group: Student Hearts for Haiti. ""I'm not the best baker in the world, but we were determined,"" Shannon said. With the help of their church's industrial-sized oven, the teens baked 2,000 cookies, selling them to people heading to and from the train stations in the Chicago suburb of LaGrange. ""I'm absolutely not a morning person, and it was freezing, but we knew our mission was urgent,"" Shannon said. The cookies were a huge hit. Commuters gobbled them up. Even people trying to stick to a diet would drop in their change. By the end of the first day, Student Hearts for Haiti had made $3,200. They sold the remaining cookies at Shannon's father's office in downtown Chicago. There, a UPS delivery man decided to buy 10 bags of cookies. He told Shannon he was from Haiti. His mother still lived there, running an orphanage that was badly damaged. ""He gave me the biggest bear hug and told me how proud he was that I was helping,"" Shannon said. ""That gave me an idea."" The group sent the donations from the cookie sales to the Red Cross and Mercy Corps for immediate relief. But if her kid-run organization wanted to continue, Shannon thought, it should provide a way for kids in the Chicago area to directly help the kids in Haiti. ""I thought after we all saw what we did on TV, other kids in my area would want to help,"" she said. ""Student Hearts for Haiti could give them the tools to do that."" So with her father's help, Shannon set up a Facebook page and started calling local schools. They also partnered with Free the Children, based in Toronto, Ontario, to rebuild a school in Haiti. Other fundraising ideas came pouring through the Facebook page: A boy whose father ran a wristband factory donated ""Hearts for Haiti"" wristbands. Shannon's high school, Lyons Township, donated the proceeds from its King of Hearts dance. Another boy turned his 15th birthday party into a fundraiser. Local merchants in LaGrange and Western Springs put out donations buckets, and so did many of Shannon's teachers. And 12 local schools started their own efforts. One of those schools was Mary Grace Chizewski's. Chizewski, 12, had also been affected by the images of suffering in Haiti. Shortly after the quake, she had reached out to her friends at St. Francis Xavier, and they approached the school's principal to ask if they could help. ""These kids in Haiti had lost everything. I thought, 'How are they going to succeed in life if they don't have a school?' "" Chizewski said. ""We hear all the time at our own school that we should help others when they are in need -- I thought here's our chance."" While sympathetic, the principal told them the school was already committed to several service projects. She wasn't sure if there'd be time. But a couple of days later, the principal got a call from Shannon's father, who convinced her to help Student Hearts for Haiti. ""I was so excited when the principal called to ask if I was still interested in helping raise money for Haiti,"" Chizewski said. Shannon's father gave the St. Francis Xavier students T-shirts and wristbands, and Chizewski and her friends spent the next recess planning how to sell the donated items. They put posters up on every floor and used the morning announcements to ask students to help. The group kept a big heart poster in the main office to track their progress. They'd color in a little more each time they'd raise $500. When the heart was full, the principal let the whole school know with an announcement on the PA system. On the school's dress-down day, students wore their Hearts for Haiti T-shirts and wristbands. ""It was so cool to see all those kids in the halls wearing our T-shirts,"" Chizewski said. ""I'd never done anything like this before."" In the end, the 672-student school generated more than $5,500. That amount was doubled when Student Hearts for Haiti got a matching grant, which meant that St. Francis Xavier's effort was enough to build and furnish one classroom in Haiti. With the matching grant from the Moyer Foundation, which was founded by Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Jamie Moyer and his wife, Karen, the group has raised more than $80,000 so far. Shannon says she still hopes to reach her goal of $90,000, and after that, she has no plans to stop there. ""I want to rebuild as many schools as we can,"" Shannon said. ""We've had rival schools helping; we've had kids from the public schools and the Catholic schools, kids who don't normally talk to each other working together on this.

256,"(CNN) -- With mostly mild cases of swine flu in the United States, swine flu fears are lessening. But viruses have a way of re-appearing. While nobody has a crystal ball, here are some thoughts about what the 2009 H1N1 virus might do in the months to come. Don't pack your face masks just yet. Public health officials expect the 2009 H1N1 virus to linger a while. 1. Is the swine flu outbreak in the United States winding down? Not yet. Health officials expect to see more cases. However, there are two reasons to think the 2009 H1N1 outbreak will wind down in the coming weeks. First, cases of influenza tend to dwindle when the weather gets warmer. Second, the 2009 H1N1 virus outbreak in Mexico has reached its peak, and numbers there are going down. It is expected that same pattern could happen in the United States.

No. Andrew Pekosz, associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, says it's important to keep in mind that the 2009 H1N1 virus is new, which means no one has immunity to it. He points out that the three outbreaks in the last century that were caused by new viruses -- in 1918, 1957 and 1968 -- started with a mild wave followed by more severe waves months later. Scientists dig for lessons from past pandemics . 3. If swine flu comes back, when would it return? ""H1N1 flu could die down soon and return later again this fall when the flu season enters back in full swing,"" says Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. ""This is always a concern with a new strain of a flu virus.""  Watch more answers to your swine flu questions » . Napolitano adds that public health officials will be keeping a close eye on the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season starts soon. ""We'll be working very closely with the international community to understand what happens to this virus over the next few months as flu season begins in the Southern Hemisphere,"" she says. ""That will tell us a lot about whether the virus is changing, whether it's becoming more severe and what measures we might want to take in the fall."" For the latest comments from  Napolitano, click here. 4. In the fall, could we have a pandemic like we had in 1918? At a press briefing last week, World Health Organization spokesman Gregory Hartl brought up the specter of the 1918 pandemic, which killed more than half a million people in the United States. ""In 1918, that pandemic started out as a very mild case of disease in the spring of 1918. ... Cases of the disease almost completely disappeared over the summer, only to reappear in the autumn of 1918 with the vengeance which we all know,"" he said. ""So even though we might be only seeing mild cases now, we cannot say what will happen in the future.""  Learn more about the swine flu » . But many experts believe it's highly unlikely there would be an outbreak anything like 1918. First of all, scientists have a much better understanding of infectious diseases, and health care has improved greatly since 1918. Secondly, the 2009 H1N1 lacks a gene that is present in highly virulent flu viruses, such as the one in 1918. ""I don't think this virus has what it takes to become a major problem,"" says Peter Palese, chairman of the department of microbiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Johns Hopkins' Pekosz adds that people remember the horrific 1918 flu season, but often forget that the two other flu outbreaks caused by new viruses, the ones in 1957 and 1968, were far more mild. 5. Will there be a vaccine for swine flu? Scientists are already working on a vaccine for 2009 H1N1. Making a new vaccine takes five to six months, according to the World Health Organization. The first step is for government scientists to grow ""seed stock"" of the virus to send to pharmaceutical companies, who would turn that stock into a vaccine. Pilot lots of the vaccine would then be tested on people. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases alerted its eight vaccine testing centers to be ready to test a 2009 H1N1 vaccine. 6. Will the vaccine be a separate shot, or will it be put in the regular seasonal flu shot? The Centers for Disease Control has said either is possible. Pekosz says there are concerns the seasonal flu shot might not work well if it includes the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, and so the decision might be made to make a separate shot. 7. If a vaccine is available in the fall, who will get it? Public health officials have emphasized that even if a vaccine is available by fall, it doesn't mean everyone will be encouraged to get it. ""I imagine that the choice of vaccination strategy will be a subject of intense discussion and study over the next several months,"" says Dr. Ted Cohen, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Cohen adds that if the vaccine is available only in limited quantities, priority might be given to health care workers and to those at high risk of complications from the flu, such as the elderly, the very young and those with certain chronic diseases. CNN's Jennifer Pifer Bixler and Shahreen Abedin contributed to this report.","Swine flu cases may have peaked, but the 2009 H1N1 virus will probably return .

257,"(CNN) -- Actor Patrick Swayze's achievements include several feature films such as ""Dirty Dancing"" and ""Ghost,"" as well as living with advanced pancreatic cancer for longer than most patients. Patrick Swayze died at age 57 of pancreatic cancer. He fought the disease for nearly two years. That Swayze, who died Monday at age 57, survived nearly two years with the condition is ""quite an accomplishment,"" Dr. George Fisher, an oncologist who treated the star at Stanford Hospitals and Clinics, told CNN's Larry King on Tuesday. Fisher revealed in early March 2008 that the actor was fighting pancreatic cancer. Swayze participated in a clinical trial at Stanford and took an experimental drug there, Fisher said. Fewer than one in four patients who have the disease that has spread outside the pancreas, as Swayze did, are alive a year later, he said.  Watch Fisher talk to King about Swayze's case » . ""Patients can survive two years -- even longer, even with standard treatment,"" Fisher said. ""It's just sad that not as many do."" Pancreatic cancer has affected several other prominent figures, including National Collegiate Athletic Association President Myles Brand, who died of the disease Wednesday. Apple Inc.'s Steve Jobs and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg have also undergone treatment for the disease. The American Cancer Society puts pancreatic cancer as the fourth most common cause of death from cancer in the United States. Lung, colon and breast cancer are the first three. Experts say that about 95 percent of those with pancreatic cancer die from the disease. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice or sudden weight loss may lead doctors to look for pancreatic cancer, said Dr. Steven Cohen, acting chief for gastrointestinal medical oncology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Cohen was not involved in Swayze's care. Doctors say early detection carries a better chance of curing the cancer, but often a patient's disease is diagnosed after it has spread. CAT scans may detect the disease early, but that does not mean everyone should have a scan with their physical, Fisher said. ""We're developing algorithms for trying to identify people at risk, and then less invasive ... tests to try to figure out who's got it and who doesn't,"" he said. Despite his illness, Swayze went forward with plans to star in A&E network's ""The Beast."" After the actor responded well to cancer treatment, the network agreed to shoot an entire season of the show. Working on the show while undergoing treatment was ""a great idea,"" Fisher said on ""Larry King Live."" ""I had my doubts as to whether he could actually do it or not, and we had many conversations around that fact,"" Fisher said. Swayze understood ""how difficult the treatment could be, and he understood how difficult the disease could be. But it's just like Patrick to just say he's going to do it and damn it, nobody should get in his way."" ""The Beast"" was canceled in June because of Swayze's illness, after doctors told him the cancer had spread to his liver. For pancreatic cancer patients, doctors are not as concerned with what happens with the pancreas as they are with how the disease spreads elsewhere, often to the liver or abdominal cavity, Cohen said. Failure of other organs that the cancer affects may ultimately cause death. Swayze's participation in the Stanford clinical trial is an important take-away point, Cohen said. Only about 5 percent of cancer patients participate in clinical trials, he said. ""Particularly for a disease like pancreatic cancer, where the standard treatments help some patients but not the majority, the ability to look at new treatments that are promising in the context and controlled setting of clinical trials, I think, is really important,"" he said. Dozens of drugs are in development or being tested in trials for pancreatic cancer, Cohen said. One such medication is paclitaxel, which is currently only approved for breast cancer but has shown promise experimentally in pancreatic tumors, he said. Cohen said he and his colleagues encourage patients to continue their daily activities and live their lives normally as best they can while undergoing treatment. A chemotherapy drug commonly used in patients, called gemcitabine, does not have the harsh symptoms of nausea, vomiting and hair loss seen in other cancer drugs. But sometimes, patients are too ill from their underlying cancer to do much, he said. ""Toward the end, they can get increasing abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite, very low energy, sort of a wasting syndrome, and there, a lot of patients just don't feel up to do anything,"" he said.","Patrick Swayze battled pancreatic cancer for nearly two years .

258,"(CNN) -- When she was about 8, Frida Sepulveda developed dark folds of skin around her neck. It's a well-known warning sign of type 2 diabetes. Frida's mother, Blanca Sepulveda, who has watched other family members struggle with diabetes and obesity, was ""devastated"" to see her daughter experience similar health problems. Now at age 11, Frida is about 5 feet, 6 inches tall and weighs around 180 pounds, her mother said. Despite a high body weight for her age and height, Frida does not seem to have additional symptoms of diabetes -- or any other major health concerns -- but her parents are trying to reverse the weight problem Frida has had since infancy. The San Diego, California, family is among a disproportionately high number of Latino-American families with overweight and obese children. According to the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health, 16.6 percent of Latino high school students were obese and 18.1 percent were overweight. The corresponding national averages for high school students were 13.3 percent obese and 15.8 percent overweight. It's an epidemic that shocked and saddened Lorena Garcia, a chef who appears on Univision and Telemundo. ""I travel all over the country to the major Hispanic festivals and I realized that 90 to 95 percent of the kids that I saw at the festivals were overweight,"" said Garcia, who established the Big Chef Little Chef program to teach Latino youth healthy cooking and eating habits. Watch Garcia interact with her fans » . The problem is caused by a wide range of cultural, social, economic, environmental and possibly genetic factors. Experts agree it is an uphill battle to solve. ""You can't just try to change someone's behavior necessarily without trying to change their environment,"" said Dr. Michael Goran, director of the University of Southern California's Childhood Obesity Research Center. How can childhood obesity be reduced? Blanca Sepulveda, 38, believes her own upbringing in Mexico before coming to the United States in junior high school ultimately contributed to her daughter's weight problem. ""The way I was raised ... you don't [leave] the dinner table until you're done with all your food. That's instilled in you,"" Sepulveda said. Back in Mexico, she said, the food was healthier and fresher, and she didn't drink soda. But she still applied that mentality to her own children, who were born and raised in the United States, where sugar-laden and fattening foods are widely available. The Sepulveda family's story is similar to that of other immigrants who are healthier than their American-born children: Those born outside the United States are less likely to be obese than native-born children, said Luisa Franzini, Ph.D., of the University of Texas School of Public Health. Despite the trends, more study is necessary to determine whether American acculturation is entirely to blame for poor diets among Latinos, an expert says. Rafael Pérez-Escamilla, a nutrition and public health professor with the University of Connecticut, wrote in the June 2009 issue of Journal of the American Diabetic Association that adaptation to U.S. society may explain, to some degree, ""deterioration of dietary quality"" and the risks of diabetes and other chronic diseases. However, he wrote, it's still not completely clear. Healthy food harder to come by . Economic factors play a major role for many Latinos in their weight struggles. Angelica Delgado is trying to overcome the obstacle with the Healthy Latino Families initiative, a culturally tailored nutrition and exercise program in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As the Community Research Supervisor for the United Community Center, Delgado is trying to get healthy school lunches in the Bruce-Guadalupe Community School, with which she's working on Healthy Latino Families. About 80 percent of Bruce Guadalupe's student body, which is 97 percent Latino, come from low-income households and therefore are eligible for reduced-price or free lunch. Without money coming in to support the lunch program, it's difficult to fund better quality food and equipment to ensure that it's freshly cooked, Delgado said. For now, she hopes the fun, bilingual setting of Healthy Latino Families will teach children to make smart food choices. The lack of availability of inexpensive, fresh, healthy food is a common for low-income populations in general, Franzini said. Research suggests that more affluent neighborhoods have a higher availability of healthy food, she said, adding that the cost of healthy food is lower in more advantaged communities. The community factor . Exercise also poses tricky problems for Latino children struggling with weight, as many live in disadvantaged areas may make it tough for them to play outside or walk to school. From a physical point of view -- in terms of sidewalks and litter -- those areas tend to be in worse shape than an average neighborhood, Franzini said. But her research also suggests that the social component of a neighborhood affects children's physical activity levels. ""It's not sufficient to just clean up the neighborhood -- pick up the trash and build sidewalks,"" said Franzini, whose study on the impact of neighborhoods' social characteristics was published earlier this year in the American Journal of Public Health. ""It also needs to be a neighborhood where people feel safe and they feel that they can go out and walk and run and exercise and do whatever they want to do."" To that end, Franzini's research indicates that those Latinos living in tight-knit communities often get more exercise than those in more mixed neighborhoods. ""Having a neighborhood which is more connected, where people feel safe -- I think it's all a matter of feeling empowered in a way. And so those who feel that they have this stronger neighborhood from a social point of view, they are also more likely to be physically active,"" Franzini said. Finding solutions . Researchers and community advocates are attempting to combat the Latino youth obesity problem. But the multitude of factors makes the issue a moving target and results of interventions are mixed. For example, about a year after a previous phase of Healthy Latino Families in Milwaukee wrapped up, children reportedly ate better and watched less television per day. Delgado said they are awaiting results from the current program, but she has seen some success already. USC's Goran worked with Latino teenagers over 16 weeks to improve their diets, promoting fiber-rich tortillas and altering recipes of aqua fresca so it would have less sugar. But at the end of the four months, he saw ""no significant improvement in the outcomes."" ""We have to do those studies over longer time periods than we have previously done to kind of give these things a chance to work and kick in,"" Goran said. ""We're ... taking it one step at a time."" And Frida's mom, Blanca Sepulveda, said she is focusing on modifying her own behavior to help her entire family. ""It's a retraining of the mind,"" Sepulveda said. ""It gets hard because you have to be an example.""","A disproportionately high number of Latino-American families struggle with obesity .

259,"(CNN) -- When Josephine Hathcock of Newark, Delaware, went in for gallbladder surgery, she never dreamed she'd wake up an ovarian cancer patient. Neither did her doctors, who found the cancer accidentally while she was on the operating table. To make matters worse, the cancer was stage 3, aggressive and had spread to her abdomen. Ovarian cancer survivor Josephine Hathcock attended a Super Luncheon to raise awareness of the disease. ""I had no idea I had it,"" says Hathcock. ""I just thought my gallbladder was having problems."" Since that surgery in 2003, Hathcock has undergone numerous treatments, including more surgery and various rounds of chemotherapy. She's made it beyond the five-year mark and is still going strong. ""To be honest,"" she says,"" I didn't think I would be here -- but here I am, and that's good."" Earlier this month, Hathcock was asked to be a guest at a luncheon to raise awareness about ovarian cancer hosted by the first lady of Delaware, Carla Markell. The gathering was part of the Super Luncheon campaign, sponsored by the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund and held throughout September, which is Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. The campaign's goal is to raise funds for research into early detection methods, as well as to find a cure. The effort is also designed to raise awareness. ""A lot of people know about breast cancer and the treatments and its symptoms because breast cancer has a strong awareness campaign,"" says Santo D'Asaro, who serves on the fund's junior board. ""We felt it was time to make women aware that there are other diseases, other cancers that can affect them that are just as important.""  Watch more on the Super Luncheons » . The format of the campaign is to have governors or first ladies, such as Markell, host luncheons for the public in order to raise the profile of ovarian cancer. Markell, who is a breast cancer survivor, says it's about time women learn more about a disease nicknamed ""the silent killer."" Paging Dr. Gupta blog: When words fail you . ""One of the most important things we can do is alert people to what the signs and symptoms are,"" says Markell. ""That way, women have a better chance of discovering it earlier."" Doctors say discovering ovarian cancer early is the key to survival. According to the National Cancer Institute, each year, more than 21,000 American women are given a diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and more than 14,000 women die from it. Ovarian cancer is called the silent killer because 75 percent of the time, the cancer is already considered advanced -- stages 3 and 4 -- when first found and has spread to other parts of the body. Doctors say early stage ovarian cancer symptoms are barely noticeable; many women don't know they have the disease until it's too late. Dr. James Larson, a Delaware gynecologist-oncologist and a guest speaker at the luncheon, says the symptoms of ovarian cancer are fairly common and could be caused by other less-threatening illnesses, so women brush them off. ""Women can have abominable pain, discomfort, pelvic pain, or they can get full easy, have a loss of appetite, bloating, lower back pain and an urgency to urinate,"" says Larson. ""But these symptoms can also be caused by other ailments we all have every day, such as muscle pain, back issues, even arthritis, or just be part of the natural aging process."" Furthermore, Larson says ovarian cancer is difficult to detect. According to the National Institutes of Health, there is no single effective screening test for ovarian cancer, ""which is the reason we need more money for research,"" says Larson. ""Until we find a screening method or a cure, women will continue to die from this form of cancer."" Larson also stresses that women need to know more about the disease itself. ""I can't tell you how many patients of mine think a Pap test detects ovarian cancer,"" he says, shaking his head. ""I tell them it's for cervical cancer. There is no definitive test for ovarian cancer."" Although there is a blood test called CA-125 that can detect a protein produced by some ovarian cancers, doctors says it's not a good screening tool for two reasons: Some ovarian tumors don't produce enough of this protein to be detected, and the protein can also be produced by benign conditions such as endometriosis, fibroids, even pregnancy. Researchers are now working on new imaging techniques that could be used to screen women every so often, much like getting a colonoscopy for colon cancer. Arizona scientists have formed a team to design and build two versions of an ovarian cancer imaging and screening tool that would use new, sophisticated techniques to detect the disease. But these remain in the experimental stages. Progress is also being made on other fronts. The FDA last week approved a new blood test that can help determine whether an existing pelvic mass is likely to be ovarian cancer or not, before a woman has surgery. According to the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, education and money for research are the best ways to fight the illness for now. Carla Markell and Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, along with their state Legislature, hope to raise money to fight ovarian cancer by allowing residents to voluntarily donate to the Delaware Ovarian Cancer Foundation Fund on their tax forms. The first lady says it's a step her state is making to help women conquer this silent killer. ""Something needs to be done,"" Markell says.

260,"(CNN) -- A single gene, called MYH9,  may be responsible for many cases of kidney disease among African-Americans, researchers say. Dr. Barry Freedman, right, speaks with a colleague in a dialysis center at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. Although doctors have blamed hypertension for causing common forms of kidney disease in African-Americans, new research shows that high blood pressure may not be the chief cause. ""The MYH9 gene association in African-American kidney disease is the most powerful genetic cause of a common disease yet discovered,"" said Dr. Barry Freedman, professor of internal medicine and nephrology at Wake Forest University, who led a team of researchers in isolating the gene. About 70 percent of African-Americans with non-diabetic forms kidney disease have the MYH9 gene, and many of them end up on dialysis, he said. The gene predisposes African-Americans to the kidney disease that was thought to stem from high blood pressure. It also gives them a higher risk of kidney disease associated with HIV. ""This genetic finding will forever change the way that we categorize the causes of kidney disease. It has the potential to lead to new treatment options to prevent this devastating disease,"" Freedman said. Kidney disease is a serious health issue among African-Americans, who have a fourfold higher risk of developing all common forms of it than whites in the United States. Dr. Bryan Becker, president of the National Kidney Foundation, called the research ""seminal work"" in identifying a gene associated with common kidney diseases. Still, the gene has not been shown to be the sole cause of kidney damage, Becker said. Diabetes and hypertension remain the most common causes of chronic kidney disease in the United States, he said. There is no reason to screen all African-Americans for the risk variant of this gene, or even all African-Americans with high blood pressure, because it is common among all African-Americans, Freedman said. Genetic screening would be most useful for people who have close relatives on dialysis, meaning they are at high risk, or individuals who want to donate kidneys, he said. There have not been studies on who should be screened, he said. Freedman conducted the research along with colleagues at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes Study. The team discovered that the gene accounts for nearly half of kidney failure among African-Americans, including diabetic-related and non-diabetic-related kidney disease. Researchers are now exploring what kinds of environmental triggers might cause the gene to promote kidney failure. HIV seems to trigger the gene and cause kidney failure, he said. Many kidney doctors had theorized that African-Americans developed kidney disease more often than whites because they might not get to see their doctors as often, had more severe high blood pressure and faced other environmental stressors, Freedman said. But research shows that the risk variant of the MYH9 gene is more prevalent in among African-American populations than white populations and seems to explain much of the excess risk for non-diabetic kidney disease in African-Americans, he said. It is still important for people to treat hypertension, which can speed up the weakening of kidneys in people with kidney disease, Freedman said. Untreated high blood pressure also leads to heart attack and stroke, he said. Dr. Michael Roizen, chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic and author of ""RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be?"" said the question still remains whether the gene initiates hypertension and kidney disease, and to what extent hypertension causes kidney disease. ""Most physicians would say that the reason blood pressure is so important is that higher levels of blood pressure cause kidney disease, and kidney disease cause higher levels blood pressure, and there's a vicious circle,"" he said. Becker also noted that researchers will have to sort out the interactions between the MYH9 gene and hypertension, as well as the gene and diabetes. No one knows why African-Americans tend to have a higher risk for hypertension. One controversial hypothesis, known as the Middle Passage theory, is that black people who survived the harrowing trip across the Atlantic Ocean from Africa in the holds of ships did so because their bodies were better able to preserve salt, allowing them to avoid death by dehydration. Therefore, the theory goes, some African-Americans have a higher prevalence of ""salt-sensitive hypertension"": Their blood pressure increases by unusually high amounts in response to salt. This theory has not been proved, or even widely studied, but the idea continues to permeate popular culture and generate discussion. The isolation of the MYH9 gene does not necessarily refute the theory, Roizen said. ""To survive, they had to retain salt, and they had to have a gene to help them do that,"" he said.","Study: Gene predisposes African-Americans to common kidney disease .

261,"Pancreatic cancer patients who are obese may be 12 times more likely to have cancer that's already spread to their lymph nodes at the time of surgery than similar cancer patients who weigh less, according to a study released Monday in the Archives of Surgery. In the study, 95 percent of patients with a BMI over 35 had a recurrence compared with 61 percent of other patients. ""What we are seeing suggests there is a difference in the way the cancer grows in obese patients versus those who are not,"" says study author Jason B. Fleming, M.D., of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. ""That is an area, from a biology standpoint, that has not really been explored."" Overall, pancreatic cancer patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 35 (223 pounds or more for someone who's 5'6"") were nearly twice as likely to have cancer recur or to die after surgery, as those who weighed less. Health.com: Are you afraid to go to the doctor because you're fat? Obese patients tended to have slightly larger tumors and were less likely to get chemotherapy or radiation before surgery than other patients. However, the survival rate did not seem to be due to the delivery of cancer care or surgical complications related to excess weight, says Fleming. ""People often wonder if obese patients have a worse outcome because they are more inherently at risk for complications, and we did not find that,"" he says.

Fleming says gastrointestinal hormones, insulin levels, and the physiology of lymphatic flow in obese patients may contribute to the spread of the tumor cells. ""There is evidence that certain hormones, or growth factors such as insulin, act to stimulate cancer cell growth,"" he says. ""What I am suggesting is that it's not just the tumor that is different, it's the environment the tumor grows in."" In the study, Fleming and colleagues monitored 285 cancer patients who had surgery to remove some or all of the pancreas. They specifically looked at a subset of 20 patients with a body mass index over 35. Health.com: What you should eat to shed pounds . The patients with a BMI greater than 35 survived a median of 13.2 months compared with 27.4 months in patients with a BMI less than 23 (136 pounds or less, for someone who's 5'6""). At the last follow-up, 75 percent of the obese patients had died, compared with 52 percent of patients with a BMI less than 35. Ninety-five percent of patients with a BMI greater than 35 had a cancer recurrence compared with 61 percent of all other patients. People who are obese are at greater risk of getting pancreatic cancer in the first place, according to Fleming. Other risk factors include smoking, long-term diabetes, hereditary disorders, and chronic pancreatitis. The pancreas is an organ located near the stomach; it releases enzymes to help digest food and produces insulin to control blood sugar. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women, according to the National Cancer Institute. Even if the cancer is caught early, the prognosis is usually poor because the cancer spreads rapidly, and symptoms (jaundice, depression, weight loss, and upper abdominal pain) may not surface until the advanced stage. Obesity is associated with worse outcomes in other types of tumors too, including breast cancer, according to Fleming. ""This isn't the first time that connection has been made,"" he says. Health.com: Fiber, starch, fats, and serving sizes: Eat right advice for your diet . Tae-Hwa Chun, M.D., an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says ""there is good evidence"" that obesity increases the risk for certain types of cancer such as postmenopausal breast cancer, and cancers of the colon, endometrium (the lining of the uterus), kidney, and esophagus. About two-thirds of U.S. adults are considered overweight, and one-third are considered obese, which is a BMI of 30 or higher, according to the Weight-Control Information Network, a service provided by the National Institutes of Health. Simple lifestyle changes, such as daily physical activity, will help spur weight loss and may help ward off some cancers, according to Chun. Not all pancreatic cancer patients are obese or overweight. Recently, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had surgery for pancreatic cancer. Last year, actor Patrick Swayze was found to have stage 4 pancreatic cancer, which he attributes to smoking. Swayze has been reportedly undergoing chemotherapy. Other procedures, including surgery and radiation, can be used to treat the disease. Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

262,"BALTIMORE, Maryland (CNN) -- A few weeks ago, 22-year-old Tatiana Gulenkina felt bad. Tired with a headache and high fever, Gulenkina knew she was coming down with something. Yet she wasn't sure with what. Besides getting vaccinated, there are other ways to boost your immune system to ward off being sick. ""My symptoms were apparently the same as for regular flu: coughs, sneezes, high temperature, sore throat and headache."" she says. But when her boyfriend took her to the doctor, her diagnosis was a little little bit of a shock. ""I had the swine flu!"" Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stopped counting the number of reported H1N1 virus incidents in this country, the American Medical Association says many of its members are starting to see more cases of the illness, along with early bouts of seasonal flu and colds. It's just that time of year when a lot of nasty bugs are out there. So the question is, what's the best way to protect yourself? Health experts will tell you the most effective way to fight the flu, including the H1N1 virus, is to get vaccinated, which causes your own body to make antibodies that target specific illnesses. After immunization, it takes up to 10 days for the vaccines to take effect. But there are other ways to boost your immune system to ward off being sick during the winter. Why boost your immune system? It's what protects you from diseases. It's designed to defend the body against millions of toxins, parasites, bacteria and microbes that would love to invade the body and make it their home. But in order to protect you, your immune system has to be healthy. If it begins to break down, then germs can attack and cause you to become ill. That's why taking care of your immune system, especially this time of year, is a must. And the best way to start is with good nutrition. You need to eat the right foods. ""Your nutrition profoundly affects your ability to fight these diseases,"" notes Katherine Tallmadge, national spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. That means fill up your plate with lean protein, including chicken, fish and fat-free dairy products. Why protein? ""The molecules that fight disease are made of protein,"" Tallmadge says. Watch more on how to rev up your immune system » . And think fats. Good fats. Certain fats improve cellular function and the ability to fight disease. For instance, when people eat more liquid oils, as opposed to hard, saturated fats, the fats end up in their cell walls. With liquid oils predominantly in the diet, cells are more flexible, communicate better and are more able to fight disease . ""More olive oil, canola oil and nuts. These are healthy fats,"" says Tallmadge. Tallmadge also reminds us to include fruits, vegetables and whole grains in our diet. These contain important antioxidants that keep your blood levels of vitamin C, beta-carotene, zinc and B-vitamins high. Which also means think vitamin supplements. But not too many. Nutritionists like Tallmadge warn that you can ingest too much of one particular vitamin or supplement and throw off the nutritional balance of your body, which can affect the immune system. ""Get nutrients naturally through the foods you eat,"" Tallmadge says. As for vitamin pills, she recommends ""just taking a multivitamin with minerals so that all your bases are covered."" If you think you need more of one particular supplement, talk to your doctor, she says. Although good nutrition is key for a healthy immune system, exercise is equally important. Studies have shown that moderate, regular exercise can boost the immune system. But doctors warn don't overdo it. Too much high-intensity activity, such as a marathon or triathlon, can make a person more susceptible to illness for as long as three days after the workout. Says Dr. David Johnson, an orthopedic surgeon at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., and avid swimmer: ""Exercise gets the blood pumping, which helps our heart, our circulation system, all our muscles and organs work better. But if you do too much, in too little time, it can hurt the body."" A daily 30-minute walk can do the trick. And don't forget to rest. A few studies point to shut-eye as a way to boost the immune system, and the National Sleep Foundation says getting the right amount of sleep is part of the ""staying well"" puzzle. Though the exact ways sleep works and how it rejuvenates the body's immune system are still a mystery, sleep experts agree that adequate rest is necessary to keep a healthy body. ""Research shows that everyone needs sleep, and that it's a critical factor in your health, weight and energy level,"" says Dr. Marc Schlosberg, a neurologist who works with the sleep lab at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, also in Washington, D.C. ""Plus, it cuts down on stress."" Scientists and doctors have known for years that long-term, chronic stress can create negative changes at the cellular level of the body, which can severely hurt the immune system. So if you can, try to chill out. Take a break, do some yoga. Walk your dog. Pet the cat. Anything to calm the soul. As for Tatiana Gulenkina, she thinks she might have caught H1N1 flu on her campus, but she's not sure. As a student at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, stress is just part of a her busy life.

263,"(CNN) -- ""Sometimes you can forget about the preciousness of life,"" hospital spokesman Allen Poston thumbed onto his Blackberry after peering into an operating room where a team of 15 doctors and medical staff separated conjoined twins in six hours in surgery. Two-month-old twins Preslee and Kylee Wells required surgical separation. ""I'm standing here in the operating room looking at the exposed beating heart of Preslee Wells,"" he wrote as he walked the halls at the Children's Hospital of Oklahoma University Medical Center. On Monday afternoon, 2-month-old Preslee and her conjoined sister, Kylee, rolled onto their own backs for the first time, he said. Poston, who updated friends and relatives on the surgery with constant posts from his hospital blog, snapped photos of each girl and showed them to friends and family who had been in the hospital waiting room since early Monday. The news of the operation's success prompted a gush of emotion, breaking the silence that had once filled the room, Poston said. After two months of waiting, the two girls were surgically separated. ""We waited because we wanted the organs to get a little bigger, a little stronger,"" Poston had told CNN over the phone earlier Monday. ""The primary concern was cardiac connection."" After cardiac imaging, doctors determined there was ""very little [cardiac] connection,"" but they remained concerned about a ""liver bridge"" connecting the twins. That bridge, Poston said, posed the greatest operational risk because of its dual use by the twins. Born October 25 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Stevie Stewart and Kylie Wells, the twins are being monitored in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. They are listed in critical condition. ""Today, they leave the OR in two different cribs, one following the other, still close in proximity, but might as well have been a mile apart,"" Poston wrote. ""And that is exactly what everybody was hoping for.""","2-month-old Preslee and her conjoined sister, Kylee, were in surgery for 6 hours .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: The earthquake in Chile was so powerful, it might have affected time! I'm Carl Azuz. You're tuned in to CNN Student News! First Up: Chile Earthquake . AZUZ: Aftershocks, still rumbling across parts of Chile. At least a dozen were recorded from Monday to Tuesday. This quake left thousands of residents without food, without water, without electricity and other just basic services. Yesterday morning, the country's president said that all emergency measures should be in place by the end of the day. Of course, the international community is pitching in, too. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Chile Tuesday, bringing along some supplies and promising that more help is on the way. Secretary Clinton also praised Chile for how prepared it was to respond to this kind of disaster and for how well the nation has responded so far. So, what's with that point we mentioned at the beginning of the show about the earthquake affecting time? Well, according to one scientist, the quake was so powerful it's possible that it affected the Earth's rotation. Based on this scientist's calculations, it should have shortened the length of a day by one-and-a-quarter microseconds. Of course, this is the second major quake to strike recently. Haiti suffered a 7.0-magnitude quake in January. And while that tremor wasn't as powerful as the one in Chile, the devastation that it caused seems to have been significantly worse. Joe Johns examines some of the reasons why. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The quake in Haiti was a 7.0, killing more than 200,000 people. The quake in Chile registered 8.8, as much as 800 times stronger. The death toll less than a thousand so far. Why is that? Geography, for one thing. The Port-au-Prince quake was in shallow earth, 15 miles from the city. The Chile quake was 30 miles off the coast, deep under water. History is another factor. No one alive remembers the series of earthquakes that hit Haiti in the 1700s. But Chile's experience is much more recent; more than 28 quakes in the 20th century, including the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in 1960. All of which has led Chile to put in and adhere to strict building codes. Chile learned its lessons the hard way, making engineering the biggest factor of all that sets Chile and Haiti apart. (END VIDEO) Iraq Appoints Ambassador . AZUZ: Moving to the Middle East now. Iraq has selected an ambassador to Kuwait for the first time in two decades. Here's some background on this for you: Kuwait borders Iraq to the south. And in August of 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. That led to ""Operation Desert Storm;"" part of the Gulf War, when a U.S.-led coalition liberated Kuwait from Iraq in 1991. Iraq was controlled by Saddam Hussein back then. And since he was removed from power in 2003, Iraq and Kuwait have been building ties. This week's announcement is the latest step in that process. I.D. Me . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a government agency that dates back to colonial times. I was first run by Benjamin Franklin. According to my unofficial motto, ""neither snow nor rain nor heat"" will keep my couriers from delivering the mail. I'm the U.S. Postal Service, and my funding doesn't come from tax dollars, only from the money my business makes. Postal Service Delivery . AZUZ: That business isn't doing so well. At the end of last September, the Postal Service was $10 billion in debt! And the agency says it could lose more than $200 billion in the next 10 years unless it is allowed to make some changes. This is why we say ""allowed"": The Post Office is an independent agency, but Congress controls how it does business. And lawmakers would have to approve some of the changes that the Post Office is considering. Among those, no more mail delivery on Saturdays. Plus, the service would look to close some branches and raise some of its prices. The postmaster general, the man who runs the Post Office, says that it'll take a big effort to turn things around. JOHN POTTER, U.S. POSTMASTER GENERAL: If we make the changes that are necessary, we can continue to provide universal service for America for decades to come. But there are some very significant changes that are gonna have to be made to the service that we offer and to the way we conduct our business on a daily basis. GM Recalls . AZUZ: Recalls: We've heard about a lot of those recently. Now, American carmaker General Motors, GM, is making a recall that affects 1.3 million vehicles in the U.S, Canada and Mexico. The problem: a potential failure in the cars' power steering. GM started investigating this problem more than a year ago. The company says it develops over time, so it's more likely to affect vehicles that have been driven 20,000 to 30,000 miles. GM says it's working on a solution to all of this. In the meantime, a company spokesman says the recall is ""the right thing to do for our customers' peace of mind."" Shoutout . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. O'Connell's AP Human Geography classes at Penn High School in Mishawaka, Indiana! In what country would you find the world's fastest train? Is it: A) China, B) France, C) Japan or D) United States? You've got three seconds -- GO! The world's fastest train zooms through China at well over 200 miles per hour. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Railway Expansion . AZUZ: With the largest population in the world -- 1.3 billion people -- China is making a huge investment in helping those folks get around the country by rail. Now, trains might sound kind of old school; you might think stagecoaches or something like that. But modern railways pollute less than planes; they're far faster than cars. Building them takes money, though. And in China's case, we're talking about stimulus money. Emily Chang reports from the railways. (BEGIN VIDEO) EMILY CHANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT, BEIJING: Beijing's newest train station looks like a modern airport, and a ride on its bullet train is nearly as fast as taking a plane. China's high-speed trains have come a long way from the steam engines that once chugged into the capital before economic reforms in the 1980s transformed long-distance transportation. This is how the majority of people travel across China. Old trains like this go as slow as 55 kilometers per hour. When it's crowded, it's standing room only and the journey can take days. But that's no longer the only option. China is now home to the world's fastest train, hurtling from Wuhan to Guangzhou at more than 350 kilometers per hour. This train is so fast, it's threatened airline ticket sales. China Southern Airlines is struggling to compete on this particular route as high-speed railways change the way Chinese people travel across this vast country. China is spinning a web of high-speed railways with faster connections than ever before. The government plans to extend 3,000 current kilometers of high-speed track to 12,000 by 2012. Estimated cost: $360 billion U.S., or 60% of the stimulus package China enacted to combat the financial crisis. JOHN GONG, CHINA ECONOMICS EXPERT: If you're investing in a high-speed railway system, you're sending checks to two million workers that are involved in the railway industry. So, that's a very easy call to make, politically. CHANG: China's rail system is now arguably the most advanced in the world. U.S. company General Electric is collaborating with Beijing on technology to modernize America's own aging rail network. While nowhere close to China's investment, President Obama has committed $8 billion to high-speed rail. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Our nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains. CHANG: Just like interstate highways transformed the United States, faster trains in China will bring infrastructure, investment and passengers to destinations deep in the countryside. Critics counter China is overbuilding and that tickets on fast trains are too expensive for average citizens. But with living standards rising, more and more will be able and willing to pay to satisfy the need for speed. Emily Chang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEO) Women's History Month .

266,"(CNN) -- Tar balls believed to be from the undersea gusher in the Gulf of Mexico have reached the shores of Louisiana's Lake Pontchartrain, a foundation that monitors the watershed reported Monday. The area affected covers a stretch of up to five miles near the city of Slidell, northeast of New Orleans, said Anne Rheams, executive director of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation. She estimated the amount of oil that has reached the lake at less than 100 barrels, with no hydrocarbon smell. ""They are about the size of a silver dollar, maybe a little bigger, kind of dispersed in long intervals. It's not as dense as it could be, so we're thankful for that,"" Rheams said. Cleanup crews had collected more than a half-ton of the tar balls -- 1,020 pounds -- by Monday evening, and the oil will be tested to confirm it came from the undersea well that has been spewing into the Gulf since April, the Joint Information Center in Houma said Monday night. But Rheams told CNN, ""They've got to be from the spill."" Tar balls had previously been spotted in Rigolets Pass, which connects the lake with Mississippi Sound. Officials in Orleans and St. Tammany parishes have been using heavy booms, barges and skimmers to defend Pontchartrain since the early days of the disaster, but Rheams said high waves and strong easterly and southeasterly winds have complicated the effort. ""The main thing is that they are an indicator that it could be coming more so this way,"" she said. State officials have closed a swath of the southern part of the 630-square-mile lake to fishing following the discovery, but there was no sign of impact to wildlife as of Monday, Rheams said. The Coast Guard reported Sunday that a shift in weather patterns could send more oil toward sensitive shores in Mississippi and Louisiana, and bad weather over the past few days has significantly hampered cleanup efforts. Rheams said that pattern was expected to persist for at least three more days. Federal officials have estimated that between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels (1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons) of oil have been spewing into the Gulf daily since April 20, when the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank in about 40 miles off the Louisiana coast. Efforts to plug the gusher have so far failed, and oil from the spill has been reported as far east as the central Florida Panhandle.","Dispersed, weathered oil reaches Lake Pontchartrain .

267,"(CNN) -- One look at her photo, and you can't help but ask: How could someone so young and vibrant die so quickly from an infection? Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa died from a sepsis infection. Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa was a healthy 20-year-old when doctors told her she had a urinary tract infection, her family says. The infection spread, and after amputating her feet, doctors thought they had the situation under control, according to a blog run by a family friend. ""She's alive, [she] will survive,"" Renato Lindgren wrote on the blog on January 20, before da Costa also had to have her hands amputated, and part of her stomach and both kidneys extracted. ""She can eat well, visit the sea, swim, travel, talk with her friends and family, marry and have a baby. She has a full and beautiful life ahead."" Four days later, da Costa was dead. Sepsis -- the body's inflammatory response to an infection -- really can kill that quickly, according to Dr. Kevin Tracey, author of a book about sepsis called ""Fatal Sequence: The Killer Within."" ""This isn't a one in a million case,"" says Tracey, chief executive officer of the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York. ""When an infection reaches a certain point, this can happen in a matter of hours."" Sepsis usually starts out as an infection in just one part of the body, such as a skin wound or a urinary tract infection, Tracey says. For example, Muppets creator Jim Henson died in 1990 from a case of sepsis that started out as pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs. He was 53. Most of the time, simple, localized infections remain just that: easy to treat and in one part of the body. Why some infections rage out of control and shut down vital organs is a mystery, but experts say it rarely happens in young, healthy people, like da Costa.  Watch more on avoiding septicemia » . ""You can ask, 'Why her?' but really no one knows why her,"" Tracey says. ""It might have something to do with her immune system. It might be about her genetics."" The Mayo Clinic sees about 100 cases a year of young, healthy people who develop sepsis, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at Mayo. With treatment, which usually involves antibiotics and sometimes draining of the wound, about 75 percent survive. Sampathkumar says the key is to keep an eye on even such simple infections as a small skin wound. A fever, a dramatic shift in blood pressure, rapid breathing and extreme confusion are all signs that someone needs quick medical help, she says. ""You need to watch it,"" she says. Dr. Carl Flatley said he had no idea what to watch for when his 23-year-old daughter, Erin, developed sepsis in 2002. He says she went into the hospital for a minor hemorrhoid procedure and five days later was dead from sepsis. ""It's a horrible death,"" he says. Two years later, knowing the signs of sepsis saved his own life, says Flatley, a dentist in Dunedin, Florida. He fell ill, and an emergency room doctor said he had a urinary tract infection and sent him home. But Flatley said he suspected it was much more than a UTI. ""I felt very sick. My testicle was sore. I told him I was concerned I had sepsis and I refused to go home. He got very irritated with me,"" Flatley says. But in the end, Flatley was admitted to the hospital, where the infection had become so severe that doctors were forced to remove his right testicle. Flatley started The Sepsis Alliance to educate others about sepsis, where he tries to walk a fine line. ""You don't want to panic people. We all get infections and, thank God, most of them heal,"" he says. ""So this is what I tell people: If you're feeling bad all over and have a high temperature and either high or low blood pressure, those are all indications that your whole system has been infected. It could be sepsis."" He advises getting medical help immediately, and to specifically mention that you're concerned you might have sepsis. ""You don't want to take any chances,"" he says.

268,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The doctors, nurses, pharmacists and technicians gathered around her son's crib, their faces grim. Pamela Gorman knew what they were thinking: Her son, Christopher, was about to die. As a newborn, Christopher Gorman was given little chance of survival. His mom calls his recovery ""a miracle."" Christopher was just a few days old and had a rare blood infection and fungal meningitis, a brain infection. ""I could tell in their eyes they had no hope for my son,"" Gorman said. ""They told me to prepare for his death. They told me he might not make it through the night."" Gorman never believed the doctors. In fact, she did something she thinks annoyed these men and women of science: She prayed. She prayed all the time. ""They made me feel ridiculous for praying so much and so hard and leaving it up to God,"" said Gorman, who lives in Idaho Falls, Idaho. ""But I told them my son not surviving was not an option."" When he was a month old, Christopher left the hospital. He's been healthy ever since, she says. He turns 3 next month. ""It was a miracle,"" she said. ""There are just things doctors can't explain. Doctors are not in control of everything. There's stuff that happens every day that they can't explain.""  Empowered Patient: Watch more on faith and medicine » . A new study finds that many Americans have that same kind of faith. In the study, 57 percent of randomly surveyed adults said God's intervention could save a deathly ill family member even if physicians said treatment would be futile. However, just under 20 percent of doctors and other medical workers said God could reverse a helpless outcome. The study was published last month in Archives of Surgery and is one of many to show a ""faith gap"" between doctors and patients. ""Patients are scared to death to talk to their doctors about this issue,"" said Dr. Harold Koenig, co-director of the Center for Spirituality, Theology and Health at Duke University. Given this gap, how can you discuss God with your physician? We asked advice from Koenig and two other physicians who study faith and medicine. 1. It's OK to ask for a doctor who also has strong religious convictions . Koenig suggests this approach when talking to a physician: ""I would say: 'My religious beliefs are very important to me and influence my medical decisions and the way I cope with illness, and I want a doctor who has those same convictions. If you don't come from that perspective, do you know a doctor you can refer me to?' "" If you're a Christian, you might find a like-minded doctor through the ZIP code search at the Christian Medical and Dental Associations. 2. Don't be surprised if you find No. 1 difficult to do . ""Religion is the last taboo in medicine,"" said Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, an internist, a Franciscan friar and director of ethics at St. Vincent's Hospital and New York Medical College in New York. ""Doctors and patients talk about intimate details like sexual practices and drug use but still have this great reluctance to talk about religion."" Sulmasy suggests not asking directly about the doctor's own religious beliefs but instead focusing on your own religious needs. 3. It's OK to ask your doctor to pray with you . According to a 2006 study by the University of Chicago, 53 percent of doctors surveyed said it was appropriate to pray with patients when asked. This can work even when doctor and patient don't share the same faith. For example, Koenig, who's Christian, has prayed with Jewish patients. ""In most cases, a general prayer asking for God's comfort, support and healing will be sufficient,"" he said. 4. Be specific about your religious needs . ""If I'm a Muslim and I come to the point of dying, the hospital might need to relax the visiting rules, because it's important to have as many people as possible with me as I recite the Quran,"" Sulmasy said. ""If I'm a Buddhist, it may be important to me to hear chant as I'm dying,"" he added. ""If I'm a Catholic, I may want to receive the Sacrament of the Sick."" 5. If you believe in miracles, say so . ""Get that out in the open,"" advised Dr. Robert Fine, an internist and head of clinical ethics and palliative care at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. Confusion may ensue if you don't, he explains. For example, sometimes doctors think families are against removing life support at the end of life because they don't understand the medical facts, when they do understand but are waiting for a miracle. ""Once we know that, we can have a discussion about faith,"" Fine said.

269,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Initial results from test runs of a ship billed as the world's largest oil skimming vessel could come back Monday after a weekend spent plowing the seas atop the undersea gusher in the Gulf of Mexico. The converted cargo ship A Whale spent the weekend attempting to separate crude oil from seawater in a 25-square-mile area north of the ruptured BP oil well at the heart of the disaster. If the test is successful, the massive vessel could play a key role in efforts to clean up the largest oil spill in U.S. history. Initial results from tests are expected Monday, Bob Grantham, spokesman for the company that owns the ship, said. The ship, which swallows water with oil then separates it, can skim about 21 million gallons of oil a day. That's at least 250 times the amount that modified fishing vessels currently conducting skimming operations have been able to contain, according to Taiwanese company TMT shipping, which owns the vessel. A total of about 550 skimming vessels were out in the Gulf on Sunday, according to a spokeswoman for the Unified Command Joint Information Center in Houma, Louisiana. But with oil still pouring into the sea at a rate of tens of thousands of barrels a day, federal authorities closed a new section of the Gulf off Louisiana to fishing on Sunday. The latest order from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration adds nearly 1,100 square miles of federal waters off Louisiana's Vermilion Bay to the off-limits zone. The new closure brings the portion of the Gulf closed to fishing due to the massive BP spill off Louisiana to 33.2 percent, NOAA reported. The Coast Guard reported earlier Sunday that a shift in weather patterns could send more oil toward sensitive shores in Mississippi and Louisiana, and bad weather over the past few days has significantly hampered cleanup efforts. ""The weather is one challenge you can't defeat,"" Coast Guard Adm. Paul Zunkunft said. Ribbons of oil stripe the water for miles, but waves Saturday were still too high for boats to skim oil off the water. ""At the Coast Guard, we do take it personally. It is portrayed as mission failure any time oil washes ashore,"" he said. Zunkunft said he will put the skimmers back to work as soon as the sea calms. Researchers have estimated that between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels (1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons) of oil have been gushing into the Gulf daily since April 20, when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank off the coast of Louisiana. The A Whale arrived in the Gulf on Wednesday and has been awaiting approval to join in cleanup efforts. The skimmer works by ""taking in oily water through a series of vents, or jaws, on the side of the ship and then decanting the intake,"" Grantham said. ""In many ways, the ship collects water like an actual whale and pumps internally like a human heart."" Zunkunft said he is also calling in reinforcements, including 300 new skimmers in the next two weeks. For the 12-hour period from midnight until noon Saturday, approximately 7,980 barrels (335,160 gallons) of oil were collected and about 4,155 barrels (174,510 gallons) of oil and 28.3 million cubic feet of natural gas were flared, BP said. The company said about 25,290 barrels (1,062,180 gallons) of oil were recovered Friday. CNN's Allan Chernoff contributed to this report.","NEW: Fisheries closure extended down Louisiana coast .

270,"(CNN) -- Could another deep water- or even shallow water- oil drilling disaster be looming ahead? Experts warn it certainly could happen again. The Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, they say, highlights flaws in the drilling industry's main defense against oil and gas explosions -- the blowout preventer, which is supposed to shut down an oil and gas well if something goes wrong. Oil companies have treated such devices as virtually fail-safe. ""They're certainly not fail-safe because they didn't close this well,"" said Paul Bommer, a petroleum engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin. ""If they had been 100 percent fail-safe they would have sealed, they would have closed.,"" There have been numerous rig blowouts, including a large gusher in the Timor Sea off the coast of Western Australia last year. And a growing number of blowouts in the past decade have caused offshore oil drilling to become sloppier. Seventy-two spills dumped 18,000 barrels of oil into U.S. federal waters from 2000-2009, while only 15 spills put 2,000 barrels into the water during the prior decade, according to data compiled by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Interior Department, which regulates energy exploration (The database excludes spills of less than 50 barrels). Avoiding such spills depends upon the reliability of the blowout preventer, which is essentially a faucet on top of the oil well that keeps oil and gas from gushing to the surface. Rig workers use the preventer to keep a well under control, especially when oil and gas surge, or ""kick up,"" from a well. When its valves don't do the job, the blowout preventer can choke off the drilling pipe -- like squeezing a straw while drinking. And, If that fails to work, a blowout preventer has yet another line of defense -- huge shear rams, like giant scissors that are supposed to be able to cut and seal the drilling pipe. But, a mile underwater, where the pressure is intense, drill pipes need to be thick, especially the joints between them. And those joints are very hard to cut. ""There are some parts of the pipe that the shears were never meant to cut,"" said Ford Brett, an expert in petroleum project management who is advising the Interior Department's oil drilling safety review. ""No one's equipment will shear the drill collar body. That's a lot of metal. It's not going to be possible to shear certain things,"" added Benton Baugh, another advisor to Interior's review of the Deepwater incident and president of Radoil, which designs and manufactures oilfield and subsea drilling equipment. A 2002 study for the Minerals Management Service warned of such trouble in shearing drilling pipe deep underwater. Initial research painted ""a grim picture of the probability of success when utilizing this final tool in securing a well,"" wrote consultant West Engineering Services. West Engineering would not comment to CNN on its studies for the government. ""The blowout preventers had a probability of failing to crush that pipe that approaches 50 percent,"" said Robert Bea, engineering professor and expert in ocean engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, who is familiar with the study. ""It would be like getting on an airplane having a 50 percent chance of making it to your destination."" Based on 55 years of engineering experience, including a stint as chief offshore engineer for Shell, Bea warned government investigators that blowout preventers are not reliable in the deep sea, and he worries they could fail in the Arctic, where the industry is pursuing energy resources. ""You can keep on pushing equipment to the point of where it breaks, and I think we broke it,"" he said. ""All of the drilling operations underway of this nature in the world today depend on these devices as the final line of defense."" In the harshest of environments, a mile underwater or in the Arctic tundra, blowout preventers operate under great stress, increasing their potential vulnerability to wear and tear. ""It is a mechanical piece of equipment. It is utilized in harsh environments. Yes, it can wear out,"" said Steve Sears, chairman of the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Louisiana State University. In fact, BP told congressional investigators there were several leaks in the hydraulic system that was supposed to power the shear rams of the Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventer. ""It was a coupling that had not been tightened down adequately. It was several turns loose,"" said a person with knowledge of the investigation. BP officials also discovered a dead battery. The final safety switch for a blowout preventer that has lost communication with its oil rig is the ""deadman"" system that's supposed to trigger the blowout preventer to shut the well. It did not activate during BP's April 20 rig explosion. Another study West Engineering Services prepared for the Minerals Management System in 2003 found flaws with the deadman system. ""The most serious drawback to this system ... is the mind set of the rig personnel. Many operator and contractor personnel refuse to arm the system from fear that it will either not operate when needed or activate inappropriately, causing downtime,"" the report said. Such downtime can be extremely costly. If the blowout preventer cuts through drilling pipe it can easily cost $10 million to replace that section of pipe and put the rig back into production, said Baugh. Given the multiple problems with blowout preventers, energy experts concede the oil industry must quickly raise its safety bar. ""We must improve the safety systems of blowout preventers. Obviously it's time to take it to the next level,"" said Baugh. ""There are more strenuous conditions occurring and we must have more strenuous solutions for them."" The Interior Department, facing the reality of energy drilling dangers, is working to toughen rules for offshore oil exploration. ""We must ensure that offshore drilling is conducted safely and in compliance with the law,"" said Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. Drilling operations not subject to the administration's six-month deepwater drilling moratorium have until the end of the month to: . -- Provide independent third party verification of the safety and effectiveness of blowout preventers, . -- Install a secondary control system for subsea blowout preventers (current regulations do not require such a backup), and . -- Adhere to new inspection and reporting requirements for blowout preventers. By September the Interior Department intends to require blowout preventers to have two sets of shear rams spaced at least four feet apart in case a drill pipe joint is in front of a shear during an emergency. The Interior Department says such steps will ""increase the safety in offshore oil and gas development,"" but concedes they ""represent only the beginning of the department's work.""","Rig blowouts have been on the increase in recent decades .

272,"(CNN) -- Texas Rangers President Nolan Ryan is calling a Tuesday night incident in which a baseball fan fell about 30 feet from the second deck of Rangers Ballpark trying to catch a foul ball an unfortunate accident. ""It's pretty hard to guard against something of that nature,"" Ryan said at a Wednesday news conference. Some guard railings in the stadium had been raised after a 1994 incident in which a woman suffered multiple injuries after falling 35 feet from the upper deck while posing for a picture, according to a report published in the Star-Telegram on April 15, 1994. Ryan said safety policies in the stadium were reviewed after Tuesday's incident and that the second-deck railings measure more than 30 inches high, above the standardized code of 26 inches. Ryan said the man who fell Tuesday night, Tyler Morris, was in good spirits when Ryan visited with him Wednesday at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth. Ryan said Morris, a firefighter with the Lake Cities Fire Department in Corinth, Texas, has fractures to the skull, foot and ankle, but hasn't lost his enthusiasm for the team. ""I was expecting him to look a lot worse then he did. I think being a firefighter, and being in the shape he is, worked in his favor,"" Ryan said. He said Morris has some recollection of what happened. ""He thought he was going to catch the ball,"" said Ryan. ""He said it hit the tip of his finger. The next thing he knew he was falling."" Ryan said Morris remembered hitting the electronic message board at the stadium, but nothing after that. Ryan said he doesn't believe Morris jumped to get the ball, but said he probably extended himself, or reached for it, before falling over the second-deck railing. Ryan also said he and other members of the Rangers organization brought Morris several autographed items when they visited him at the hospital, including the ball that he was trying to catch when he fell. ""He was as thrilled to get that as anything else we brought him,"" Ryan said. ""He's a die-hard Rangers fan, and grew up a Rangers fan. He was real appreciative that we came to visit him,"" Ryan said. Wednesday morning, the Morris family issued a statement that said Morris is expected to make a full recovery, according to CNN affiliate KTVT/KTXA, . Morris is lucky to be alive, according to an off-duty paramedic who was one of the first people to come to the man's aid. ""The fall could have easily killed the guy,"" Derek Dilday said. In an interview with HLN, Dilday said he rushed to the man's aid after witnessing the entire incident. ""I turned to my left to watch the foul ball, and I saw this guy reach over the railing. Then I saw his feet go up, he tried to reach back for the railing, but he missed it. He hit the video-tron (electronic message board), then fell the rest of the way like a rag doll."" ""It was the most shocking thing I had even seen,"" he said. Dilday said he ran about 50 feet to get to the spot where Morris had fallen. ""He was laying in the aisle on his back. There was no external bleeding, which was a good thing. I held his head and tried to keep him still until the medics arrived."" Dilday said Morris was having difficulty breathing but was trying to move. ""He tried to move his neck, he tried to get up, I kept telling him, 'Stay still, stay still.'"" By the time medics arrived, Morris was able to say his name, Dilday said. ""He was able to move all his extremities and was responsive to the paramedics,"" Rangers spokesman John Blake said. Morris fell on top of four other fans, causing minor injuries to them, said Ryan. ""One woman had a bruised knee, one man had a bruised shoulder, someone was hit by Morris's shoe,"" he said. ""They chose not to go to the hospital emergency room and were treated in the stadium's first aid area,"" Ryan said. All stayed for the remainder of the game, he said. The game between the Texas Rangers and Cleveland Indians was delayed for 16 minutes after the fall. The Rangers eventually won, 12-1.

273,"(Coastal Living) -- The spirit of a mourning mother haunts Heceta Head, a 115-year-old lightstation on the windswept Oregon Coast. Some say the ghost, called The Gray Lady, searches for her infant daughter, who tumbled from the 200-foot cliffs to her death. Heceta Head sits on an isolated stretch of the windswept Oregon Coast. A visitor can get creeped out just by the setting -- an isolated stretch of shore where sudden fog can blot out the sun. Mariners braving the pounding surf depend on the lighthouse to avoid smashing into the rocks below. The beacon, the strongest on the Oregon Coast, is visible 21 miles away at sea. The Gray Lady, usually seen wearing a floor-length gray skirt, lurks in the attic of the lightkeeper's home, which is on the National Register of Historic Places and now operates as a bed-and-breakfast. One worker saw the silver-haired ghost floating over the floorboards as he repaired a broken attic window. He fled, but the next day the shattered glass in the sealed room had been swept into a neat pile. Others report a mischievous side to the spirit. Lights flick on unexpectedly, doors suddenly lock, and objects placed in one room later appear in another. Coastal Living: Top 10 haunted lighthouses . Photographer Steve Terrill of Portland recalls standing outside at dusk and seeing a translucent figure looking down on him from the attic. ""It moved and then it disappeared,"" he says. ""We knew absolutely nobody was in there. I thought, 'Man this is weird. This must be my imagination.'"" Steve and a friend were the only ones staying in the building. The next morning his friend called out in alarm. During the night, the inn's guestbook mysteriously appeared in his room. It was open to a page describing a previous lodger's encounter with the spirit. ""I don't know where that book came from,"" Steve says. ""I'm getting goosebumps now just thinking about it.""

274,"(CNN) -- A tourist boat with more than 30 people on board overturned on the Delaware River at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Wednesday after it was hit by a barge, Philadelphia police and the Coast Guard said. ""We confirmed that there were 37 people on board, 35 passengers and two crew. As of right now we have confirmed that 35 people have been recovered. There are two people missing,"" said David Umberger, the Coast Guard's civilian search and rescue controller for the area, shortly after the accident. The two missing people are a 16-year-old female and a 20-year-old male, Lt. Frank Vanore of the Philadelphia Police Department told reporters later Wednesday afternoon. Vanore said that the boat had ""mechanical trouble"" and the engine shut down after a fire on board. While the boat was in the river and waiting for help, it was hit by a barge, he said. The National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday night it had  sent an investigative team to the scene. The Coast Guard's Umberger said the search was continuing for the missing. ""We have all of our port partners engaged in that search-and-rescue case, including the state police, Philly police, fire department, good samaritans and the Coast Guard,"" he said. Deputy Commissioner William  Blackburn of the Philadelphia police told CNN  that searchers located the boat in  about 50 feet of murky water but it was too dangerous to send divers down. The  boat is upright on the bottom of the river, Blackburn said, adding that it has  been marked by a  buoy and divers will be sent down when it is deemed safe. One area hospital, Hahnemann University Hospital, reported eight patients -- two adults, three children, three teenagers -- were brought in after the incident. Two other passengers on the boat also were taken to the hospital but declined treatment, Hahnemann Hospital spokeswoman Coleen Cannon said. Of the eight patients, one adult and two children were discharged a few hours after the incident, she said.

275,"(CNN) -- Flash floods caused by persistent heavy rains in Oklahoma have claimed the life of a 13-year-old girl, the state medical examiner's office told CNN Friday morning. The unidentified teenager went missing on Thursday after playing with friends at a drainage ditch in the Durant area, according to Cherokee Ballard, the office's spokeswoman. Durant is less than two hours north of Dallas, Texas. Heavy rains have battered the Oklahoma area in recent days. A dramatic rescue captured Thursday in Oklahoma City by a CNN affiliate camera crew showed firefighters trudge through waist-high muddy floodwater to grab a trapped motorist out of his submerged car. Oklahoma Battalion Fire Chief Brian Stanaland said the motorist did not need medical attention. The girl is the third child to be swept away in Oklahoma flooding in less than a week. Rescuers searched for a 13-year-old boy earlier this week who they feared had drowned after falling into a creek swollen by heavy rains. Emergency crews Tuesday were able to fish a 14-year-old boy who fell into Lightning Creek out of the rushing waters, said Cecil Clay, chief of the Oklahoma City Fire Department. A flash flood warning remained in effect in several central Oklahoma counties Friday, the National Weather Service said. CNN's Rick Martin and Divina Mims contributed to this report.","NEW: 13-year-old girl drowns after being swept away by floods, officials say .

276,"(CNN) -- A body was recovered in the vicinity of a boat accident in the Delaware River, a Coast Guard spokeswoman said Friday. Two passengers -- a 16-year-old girl and a 20-year-old man -- went missing in that area after a tour boat collided with a barge on the Delaware River in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Wednesday. The Coast Guard would not say definitively Friday that the body recovered was one of the two victims, waiting for the body to be positively identified by the Philadelphia Medical Examiner. Rescuers saved 35 people who were on the ""Duck"" boat at the time of the crash. The tour boat had a clean record, said the president of Ride the Ducks, who traveled to Philadelphia from the company's headquarters in Norcross, Georgia. ""I can tell you this boat has been inspected frequently. Twice daily. We've never had a problem with this boat,"" said Chris Herschend. The company voluntarily shut down its nationwide operations, including Stone Mountain Park, Georgia; Branson, Missouri; and San Francisco, California. ""What we hope to learn [is how] to prevent this from ever happening again,"" Herschend said. Officials said people reacted quickly after the collision. ""The immediate response was amazing,"" said U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Todd Gaitlin. ""The private citizens helped [rescuers] get people out of the water."" Police and Coast Guard vessels searched the river Thursday. Lt. Frank Vanore of the Philadelphia Police Department told reporters Wednesday that the boat had ""mechanical trouble"" and the engine shut down after a fire on board. While the boat was in the river and waiting for help, it was hit by a barge, he said. The boat overturned and passengers were spilled into the river. National Transportation Safety Board officials will interview crew members on Friday, NTSB spokesman Robert Sumwalt said in Philadelphia Thursday afternoon. The investigation will include reviews from cameras along the river, training and navigation methods and safety equipment. ""We want to find out what happened and issue safety regulations so that this does not happen again,"" said Sumwalt, who is vice chairman of the NTSB. Alcohol tests on crew members came back negative, Sumwalt said. Drug tests will take longer to analyze. The 10 investigators will also look at allegations that similar boats have previously overheated or had mechanical problems. Herschend said the company is investigating and assisting fire and police officials. ""I believe this was an accident."" He said he could not speculate on whether there was a fire onboard or how the boat's captain communicated during the incident. But he said he believes the unidentified captain followed all procedures. He was unsure how long the boat was dead in the water before the collision. Asked by reporters Thursday whether the barge was at fault, Herschend said, ""I don't want to speculate. For me it is not to assign blame."" He said the 10-year-old craft had portable flotation devices. Herschend said the company is checking on whether the captain told people to jump off the boat moments before impact. ""It is my expectation for the captain that he followed our emergency procedures to the letter,"" he said. ""Our first priority is the people on board,"" Herschend said. ""Then we are going to work on making sure this never happens again."" The missing people are believed to be from outside the United States, he said. Searchers located the boat in about 50 feet of murky water, but it was too dangerous to send divers down, said William Blackburn, deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia police. The boat is upright on the bottom of the river, Blackburn said. The ""Duck"" boats are amphibious military vehicles designed in the 1940s. The NTSB will also conduct a 72-hour history to determine the mental and emotional state of the crew of boat vessels, Sumwalt said. Eleven passengers were hospitalized. Nine were released by Thursday morning. One passenger suffered a broken jaw, Gaitlin said. The company, Ride the Ducks, is owned by Herschend Family Entertainment. The company's website posted this message Thursday: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with our Philadelphia tour guests, crew members and their families. We are attending to their needs first. In the interim, we have voluntarily suspended our Ride The Ducks operations nationwide. If you already have a reservation, you can receive a full refund or reschedule for a future date. We will resume operations shortly."" CNN's Sarah Hoye and Cassie Spodak contributed to this report.","NEW: A body was recovered Friday .

277,"(CNN) -- A quarrel between occupants of two vehicles at a McDonald's restaurant drive-through in southern Finland erupted in gunfire Tuesday, leaving three men dead, police said. Three occupants in one of the vehicles have been arrested, said Peter Fagerholm, a detective inspector in the town of Porvoo. The two vehicles were in line at the restaurant about 2 a.m. when the quarrel began, Fagerholm said. Shots from a semiautomatic handgun were fired from a Toyota SUV into a convertible driven by a pregnant woman and carrying four men. Two of the men in the convertible, ages 28 and 45, died at the scene. Another 28-year-old man died Tuesday afternoon at a hospital in Finland's capital, Helsinki, about 50 miles to the west, Fagerholm said. Two of the men were shot in the head, the other in the chest, he said. The cause of the argument was not immediately known. ""We believe it was a very small issue"" that escalated, Fagerholm said late Tuesday. He said he doesn't believe the parties in the different cars knew each other, or that the shooting was preplanned. The SUV carried one woman and two men, Fagerholm said. One of the men, 41, is the principal suspect. In 1995 he was sentenced to life in prison on one count of murder and two counts of attempted homicide, Fagerholm said. He was released on parole in December. Fagerholm would not release the suspect's name. Authorities are speaking with witnesses in a third car in the drive-through line.

278,"(CNN) -- A man who killed himself before police could question him about the abduction of a 4-year-old Missouri girl was a convicted sex offender, a local official told CNN Thursday. Paul Smith, 38, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, Lincoln County, Missouri, coroner Robert Shramek said. Smith shot himself as investigators approached him late Wednesday afternoon. He died in a hospital at 10:29 p.m., Shramek said. Smith was a convicted sex offender, according to Missouri's sex offender registry and Louisiana, Missouri, city administrator Bob Jenne. St. Louis County Police Chief Timothy Fitch told reporters Thursday that ""good old-fashioned detective work"" led authorities to Smith. ""We have plenty of evidence that Paul Smith is the suspect,"" Fitch said in a news conference. The girl, Alisa Maier, was found alive Tuesday night in the St. Louis suburb of Fenton, about 70 miles south of her Mississippi River hometown of Louisiana, Missouri. She was wearing different clothes than the ones she had on when she was abducted, and Fitch said they were able to trace those clothes to a particular Wal-Mart. Store employees showed authorities transaction records from Smith's purchase of a pack of cigarettes, which in Missouri, requires the buyer to give their date of birth. ""All (investigators) had to work with was some video of this individual and his date of birth,"" Fitch said. Alisa was discovered at a gas station car wash, where witnesses saw her walking away from a car with a very loud muffler, which then left the station. Fitch said Smith was familiar with that area. The little girl's parents identified her from a photograph sent by police there, her grandfather, Roy Harrison, said Wednesday night. ""You couldn't miss the big brown eyes,"" Harrison told HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" But the search went on for the man who abducted her, who was seen driving a dark-colored, four-door sedan with missing wheel covers and a loud muffler. A tip led police to a home in the town of Hawk Point, about 45 miles south of Louisiana, where police found a car parked outside a home that roughly matched that description, Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Al Nothum said. Before police could speak to the man at the home, ""He pulled out a gun and shot himself,"" Nothum said. Alisa was snatched from the front yard of her home Monday evening as she played with her 6-year-old brother. Harrison said his granddaughter is ""a bright young girl"" who has talked ""a little bit"" with her parents about her abduction. Anita McKlevis, a neighbor, told HLN's ""Prime News"" that the town of about 4,000 was overjoyed by the girl's safe return. ""It was like someone gave us all $1 million,"" McKlevis said. ""Everybody is so happy for this little girl and the family. We are going to stick by the family. That's important."" McKlevis said she sent cupcakes to the family's home, ""because I know she loves them."" And Harrison said the family was ""ecstatic"" over Alisa's safe return. ""I've told people earlier, if I could do a back flip, I would,"" he said. ""When we get her back and get the family together, we're gonna have a barbecue and togetherness, and hugs and kisses. I couldn't be any happier.""","NEW: Paul Smith, suspected of abducting a 4-year-old gir, was a convicted sex offender .

280,"(CNN) -- Companies involved in the sinking of the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon made ""some very major mistakes,"" Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Thursday after meeting with executives from the oil company BP. Salazar would not elaborate, telling reporters in Houston, Texas, that the cause remains under investigation. But he said the failure of the rig's blowout preventer -- a critical piece of equipment designed to shut off the flow of oil in an emergency -- was ""a huge malfunction"" that has left oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. ""The investigation will lead to conclusions about what exactly happened, but it didn't work the way it was supposed to work,"" Salazar said. ""And from my own preliminary observations, there were some very major mistakes that were made by the companies that were involved. But today is not really the day to deal with those issues."" The Coast Guard and the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service are leading the investigation into the loss of the drill rig, owned by BP contractor Transocean Ltd. The slick has been spreading across the northern Gulf of Mexico since late April, when the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 40 miles off the mouth of the Mississippi River. Eleven missing workers who were aboard the rig are presumed dead. BP owns the damaged well at the heart of the slick. Efforts to shut down the well have failed, leaving it spewing about 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of oil per day into the Gulf of Mexico. There was no immediate response to Salazar's comments from BP, which has blamed Transocean. Salazar's meeting with BP executives -- his second trip to Houston in less than a week -- comes as oil washed ashore on Louisiana's barrier islands and drifted west past the mouth of the Mississippi River. Workers also prepared to lower a massive containment vessel over the Gulf of Mexico's two-week-old undersea gusher. Have you been affected by the oil spill? Share your story, images . A pinkish-orange foam mixture of seawater and crude oil streaked across large stretches of water in the northern Gulf and turned up in the on the shores of the Chandeleur Islands, off southeastern Louisiana. Trace amounts of sheen had been reported on the shores of southeastern Louisiana over the past week, but the landfall reported Thursday appeared to the ""first impacts"" of oil from the spill, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry told reporters. Doug Suttles, chief operating officer for BP, said mild weather gave cleanup crews more time to attack the spill. More controlled burns were conducted Thursday, after BP and the Coast Guard used fire to destroy several thousand barrels of oil on the surface Wednesday, he said. But the spill was spreading westward and is projected to drift toward coastal parishes past the Mississippi River delta, spurring Louisiana to begin shifting preventive efforts to its southwestern coast, Gov. Bobby Jindal told reporters Thursday. ""That obviously opens up many more vulnerable areas along our coast,"" Jindal said. ""We're going to do everything we can to keep this oil out."" The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration already has closed the area to fishing, restricting a multibillion-dollar industry in the region. Suttles said BP held a meeting with parish governments and state officials, who offered ideas for beating back the oily tide and leveled criticisms. ""What's clear is this is their home,"" he said. ""And what's also clear is they're passionate about protecting their home."" Under federal law, BP is responsible for capping the well and paying for the cleanup. The company shipped a four-story-high containment vessel to the site overnight and expected to lower it toward the seabed nearly a mile below the surface late Thursday, Suttles said. The hope is that the container will collect the leaking oil, which would be sucked up to a drill ship on the surface. If the operation is successful, BP plans to deploy a second, smaller dome to deal with a second leak in the ruptured pipe. But getting the large structure into position could take several days, and the technique has never been attempted at the depth of these leaks. ""If all goes according to plan by early next week we hope to make it operational,"" Suttles said. ""As we always do, though, we stress this has never been done before. We'll likely encounter numerous challenges, but we'll remain committed to make it work."" BP has stopped the flow of oil from one of the three existing leak points from the sunken rig, but it was the smallest of the three leaks and did not affect the amount of crude pouring into the ocean. CNN's David Mattingly contributed to this report.","Firms involved in rig's sinking made ""very major mistakes,"" Ken Salazar says .

283,"Rio Largo, Brazil (CNN) -- Federal aid is flowing to rain-ravaged areas of northeastern Brazil and the number of missing has diminished to less than 140, but more than 150,000 people remained homeless or displaced Friday, the government said. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Friday he will not attend this weekend's G20 meeting in Canada to attend to the emergency at home, the Agencia Brasil government news outlet reported. Finance Minister Guido Mantega will take Lula's place. The death count in two hard-hit states still stood at 46 -- 29 in Alagoas state and 16 in Pernambuco, Agencia Brasil said. There were nearly 75,000 homeless or displaced residents in Alagoas and more than 80,000 in Pernambuco, the national civil defense office said. In addition, civil defense said, there were more than 19,000 homes in Alagoas that were damaged or destroyed, as were 79 bridges. In all, civil defense said on its website, 59 municipalities have been affected in Pernambuco and 28 in Alagoas. The number of missing in Alagoas, which had stood at more than 600 Thursday, dropped to 135 as residents in some flooded towns were rescued, civil defense said. The federal government announced Thursday the release of 500 million reais ($277 million) to help victims. The money comes on top of a previous 50 million reais ($27.7 million) destined for Pernambuco and Alagoas. Lula also signed Thursday an interim measure of 1 billion reais ($555 million) to purchase construction material and equipment for businesses affected by the floods. The Organization of American States and the United States, which offered $50,000, also have pledged aid.","Number of missing drops to less than 140 in northern Brazil .

The bus was headed to Incheon International Airport, west of the capital Seoul, when it crashed through a guard rail and fell about 10 meters (32 feet) from the Incheon Bridge, the Yonhap news agency said. Police told the news agency that the bus may have lost control while trying to avoid a truck. The truck, in turn, had swerved to avoid colliding with a stalled car in the middle of the bridge. The Incheon Bridge, at 21.38 km (13.2 miles), is the country's largest.","Bus plunges 32 feet after trying to avoid collision with a truck .

287,"(CNN) -- The group of Hungarian teens and young adults had traveled to the United States to experience American culture during a three-week trip of hiking excursions, overnight retreats, home-stays and tourist stops. Now, the group will return home without two of its members, carrying memories of the tragic boating accident that took their lives. The bodies of Dora Schwendtner, 16, and Szabolcs Prem, 20, were recovered from the site of the boating accident in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Friday and identified later in the day, according to authorities. The discoveries came two days after a tour boat the group was on collided with a barge in the Delaware River. Rescuers saved 35 people on the tour boat, popularly known as a duck boat, an amphibious vehicle that takes passengers on land and sea to major destinations on Philadelphia's tourist track. Among those rescued were some of the Hungarians and their hosts from Marshallton United Methodist Church of West Chester, Pennsylvania. Schwendtner and Prem were missing for more than two days before their fate was confirmed. The 15 Hungarians arrived in the United States on July 2 on a cultural exchange program organized by Atlantic Bridge, a Netherlands-based group that describes itself as ""a Christian, international, cross-cultural team with a passion for young people."" The team of Hungarian ""BridgeBuilders"" came from Mosonmagyarovar, a town in northwest Hungary known for its hot baths and large number of dentists, drawing Austrians from across the border in search of cheap dental work, according to Atlantic Bridge's website. The leaders of Atlantic Bridge did not respond to e-mails for comment Friday night, but the group's website provides a loose timeline of the youths' travels. Representatives from Marshallton United Methodist Church did not return requests for comment Friday night. After the youths arrived in New York they spent the Fourth of July weekend visiting ground zero, Central Park and Chinatown, and celebrating the nation's birthday with host families, Atlantic Bridge's director, John Oostdyk, wrote on the organization's website. On July 6, they set out in five cars to West Chester, Pennsylvania, to meet their hosts from the Marshallton United Methodist Church for the next leg of their trip. Marshallton sent a youth group to Hungary through Atlantic Bridge in 2006, and a team from Hungary first came in 2007, the church said on its website. ""Together the two youth groups share in Christian fellowship and fun, while the visitors stay with host families, and enjoy tours to various cultural and historic places in their respective countries,"" a statement said. The next day, seven members of the church accompanied their Hungarian counterparts on a trip to Philadelphia, where they boarded the ""Ride the Ducks"" tour boat at Penn's Landing. The boat had mechanical trouble and the engine shut down after a fire onboard, Lt. Frank Vanore of the Philadelphia Police Department said Wednesday. While the boat was waiting for help in the river, the barge hit it, Vanore said. The boat overturned and passengers were spilled into the river. ""When I saw the picture I realized how true it was when someone earlier said 'it is a miracle anyone survived this,' "" Oostdyk said on Atlantic Bridge's website. ""Ride the Ducks"" voluntarily shut down operations at all its locations across the country, and the NTSB is investigating the incident. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with our Philadelphia tour guests, crew members and their families. We are attending to their needs first,"" the company said on its website. After the passengers were brought to land, a count was taken and it was discovered that Schwendtner and Prem were missing, the church said. The group went back to Marshallton, where they were looked after by the Rev. Scott Widmer, the church's pastor, and members of the congregation and community. ""The church is continuing to provide comfort, prayer, pastoral care and sanctuary for the spiritual needs of the youth groups in the midst of their shock and grief,"" Marshallton said on its website. The Hungarian youths are still in Pennsylvania, according to an employee in Atlantic Bridge's Netherlands office, but it was unclear whether they would stay until their scheduled return on July 23. On Wednesday, Oostdyk flew to the United States to be with the group. On Thursday, prayer vigils were held at two United Methodist churches in the region, drawing attendees from churches and communities throughout the area. ""It was a world of grief, but also a world of compassion and prayer and of gathering around the team of Hungarian students who had seen their summer of high expectations destroyed in a matter of minutes just 24 hours earlier,"" Oostdyk said.","Bodies of Dora Schwendtner, Szabolcs Prem, found near site of Pennsylvania boating accident .

288,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- As oil again again flows freely, crews are working around the clock to replace a containment cap on the ruptured underwater well in the Gulf of Mexico, BP said Saturday. The company hopes to install a better-fitting one in the coming days, BP senior Vice President Kent Wells said. ""We're on plan,"" he said hours after the old cap was removed. Live video showed robots in the process of removing six bolts from the apparatus so that the new cap can be positioned. The bolts may all be removed by Sunday. The old cap had been diverting about 15,000 barrels a day (630,000 gallons) to a ship. BP still is recovering an additional 8,000 to 9,000 barrels a day (336,000 to 378,000 gallons) through a line connected to another vessel, the Q4000. Wells said the sealing cap operation is expected to take four to seven days, with favorable weather helping the process along. In upcoming weeks, there will be an increase in the current oil containment work. A fleet of skimmers will help recover the oil now making its way to the surface. ""As we start to ramp up the additional containment capacity, we should see less and less flow,"" Wells said. Wells said crews are in the final stages of hooking up the Helix Producer, another oil recovery vessel, to the well. The vessel is expected to begin collecting oil by Sunday and officials hope to reach full collection capacity of 20,000 to 25,000 barrels (840,000 to 1.5 million gallons) per day within three days. ""We're in the final stages in doing the pressure testing"" on the Helix Producer, Wells said. If successful, the effects of the containment cap operation could halt the oil gusher that started April 20 after a deadly explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Officials have said such a fix would be temporary, and the permanent solution would still be completion of a relief well. There are two relief wells under construction, with one expected to be completed in August. One could intercept the leaking well as early as the end of July. Over the next two to three weeks, 60,000 to 80,000 barrels (2.52 million to 3.36 million gallons) a day should be contained, Wells said. Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil are spewing daily from BP's breached Macondo well. The company also says the sealing cap work ""is intended to run in parallel with the installation and start-up of the Helix Producer."" BP says there will be a period of decreased oil and gas capture from the wellhead during the cap replacement. It said another recovery vessel, the Q4000, ""should continue to capture and flare oil and gas.""  There will be other recovery vessels and skimmers deployed. ""This can be done very effectively,"" Wells said. Wells also said there will be ""significant measurement capability"" added to the new cap so officials can get a good idea of the flow rate. BP said in a statement that the new cap ""should improve containment efficiency during hurricane season by allowing shorter disconnect and reconnect times."" Wells echoed much of what retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Friday. Allen said he approved the cap-switch plan in order to take advantage of favorable weather predicted for coming days and because, once the switch is complete, the resulting capacity to contain oil ""will be far greater than the capabilities we have achieved using current systems."" Allen stressed that once the capping device is on, ""we would get the most accurate flow rate to date,"" he said. Meanwhile, Allen on Saturday announced that Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft is scheduled to relieve Rear Adm. James Watson as the federal on-scene coordinator Monday. Zukunft, who has been in the region for several weeks overseeing strategic planning, is the Coast Guard's assistant commandant for marine safety, security and stewardship. Watson will return to his previous duties. CNN's Sanjay Gupta, Vivian Kuo and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report .","NEW: Replacement process is ""on plan,"" BP official says .

289,"United Nations (CNN) -- Six months after an earthquake devastated Haiti, a United Nations representative on the ground there says many challenges still lie ahead in the aftermath of the ""worst living disaster."" Nigel Fisher, the deputy special representative for the stabilization mission in Haiti, told the U.N. press via video-conference Monday that progress has been made in rehabilitating the country, but that the nation still faces many problems. The January 12 quake left over 220,000 dead, over 300,000 injured, and over a million homeless. According to recent U.N. reports, the quake destroyed 60 percent of government infrastructure, and left more than 180,000 homes uninhabitable. Six months later, more than 1.5 million remain in overcrowded displacement camps, and Fisher does not anticipate the number in camps to reduce soon. According to the United Nations, 1,300 camping sites and 11,000 latrines have been built, and thousands of kilos of food and humanitarian resources have been delivered to those in need. Fisher said that despite a lack of communication, destroyed roads and lack of transportation and railway systems, food was delivered relatively quickly to displaced Haitians. The response from the international community, Fisher said, was ""quite significant."" Houses that were not structurally damaged are being rebuilt at a relatively low cost, though tents and camps are undergoing their second ""phase of replacement."" An unforeseen difficulty of ""land tenure,"" especially in a ""place where land ownership has been disputed for years,"" has significantly slowed down the process of building more permanent houses in preparation for the hurricane season. ""It is important to remember what Haiti was and what Port-au-Prince was before the earthquake: two-thirds of the population was living in poverty, many lacked access to clean water and were living in slums,"" Fisher said. According to 2009 U.N. reports, 55 percent of Haitians lived on less than $1.25 a day, and per capita annual income was US $660. Fifty-eight percent of children were under-nourished and 58 percent of the population lacked access to clean water. The earthquake followed the devastating 2008 hurricanes that affected 800,000 Haitians, and deforestation left the country with less than 2 percent forest cover. ""Then, the catastrophic earthquake left 230,000 dead, 300,000 injured and an estimated one million homeless. In addition, 17 million cubic meters of debris were scattered on the streets,"" Fisher explained. Fisher said the relocation of displaced families from the camps to newly built homes has posed a problem because of two main concerns on the part of family members: the need for a job and for a nearby school where their children could receive an education. Furthermore, the private sector, which has been damaged by the ""overwhelming response from the international community,"" has experienced a loss of clients and ""extremely high interest rates"" that Fisher said can be solved only through recapitalization of the private sector by the country itself. But with a focus more on urban reconstruction and the development of a closer link between government and education, Fisher said Haiti could become a better nation than it was before the earthquake. ""We have a long way to go, but things could have been much worse."" Nutritional status and general health ""has not worsened in the months since the earthquake,"" he said. ""There has been no epidemic of cholera or measles,"" Fisher stated, because access to clean water and free medical facilities have reduced chances of an outbreak. He asserted even that the U.N. mission has seen improvement in some of the camps.","U.N. rep in Haiti says progress has been made but many problems still ahead .

290,"(CNN) -- On January 12, I went to basketball practice and then spent time with a kids' basketball league. The whole time my phone was in the car. When I finally looked at it, I had about 50 messages saying, ""Have you been watching the news about Haiti?"" It still haunts me to think that, as I went about my business that day, my homeland shuddered, crashed, and crumbled. More than 220,000 of my fellow Haitians died. Another 1.6 million were instantly left homeless -- most with nothing but the clothes on their backs. About 800,000 of them are children. Haiti has never been an easy place to be a kid. When I was growing up in Port-au-Prince, I felt lucky because I always had at least one meal a day. Some of my friends were starving. But we all shared what we had with each other. We figured out ways to have fun with nothing but a small patch of dirt to play in. We got along with very little, and we told ourselves that -- if we got just the slightest opportunity -- we would grab onto it and use it to do great things. That is what Haiti's children need now. They need opportunity. They need our help. It is amazing what kids can endure. Haiti's children have held the hands of parents as they lay crushed and dying beneath rubble. They've lost families, best friends, homes, schools. They can survive all that. But they can't thrive without us stepping up. Right after the earthquake, the immediate and enormous generosity from people in the U.S. made such a difference in Haiti -- and it made me very proud to be part of this huge-hearted nation. Organizations like UNICEF, which I have partnered with for years through my Samuel Dalembert Foundation, were able to provide emergency relief that stopped another wave of disaster in the form of disease and starvation. In the last six months, UNICEF has been providing water, food, shelter, immunizations, medicines, child protection, and education supplies to hundreds of thousands of Haitian children and their families. But in many ways, the hard work is just beginning. And the need remains huge. Those 1.6 million people left homeless are still living in tents and makeshift shelters -- and hurricane season is fast approaching. More than one third of the spontaneous settlements that have been created lack adequate sanitation, and this can make kids ill and lead to major disease outbreaks. People in settlements still rely on water being trucked in every day, and many don't get enough considering the near 100-degree heat. Learn more about helping Haiti at Impact Your World . Education is going to make all the difference to Haiti's future. Given the opportunity to learn, the children who survived the earthquake will grow up to transform their nation and lead it towards prosperity. But before the earthquake, only four in ten kids went to school, and that number is even lower now. Teachers are also absent because so many lost their homes and are now displaced. I was lucky enough to get the opportunity I dreamed of as a child in Haiti. And I started my foundation because I wanted to give other kids that chance, too. It's my deep belief that those who are lucky enough to have success in this life should do something -- anything -- to help others. So I ask: Even if you've already been generous, don't forget Haiti now that it's dropped from the news headlines. Organizations like UNICEF are there for kids, but they need funds to rebuild schools, train teachers, set up feeding centers, immunize against disease, dig wells, install water pumps... There are hundreds of thousands of very resilient kids in Haiti who are surviving despite all they've been through. They can endure a lot. Parents dying. Living in tents in 100-degree weather and rainstorms. Hungry bellies. But we don't want a nation of kids just barely surviving -- we want a nation of leaders. Haiti's children can't become leaders if they don't go to school. They can't become leaders if they're so hungry they can't concentrate. Or if they have to spend their days selling sodas in the street to make a few pennies. They can't become leaders if the water they drink makes them chronically sick. Or if they never get the vaccines that will keep deadly diseases away. If you join me in giving Haiti's kids the opportunities they deserve, I can promise they will do great things.

291,"(CNN) -- A 14-year-old cruise passenger was killed in a crossfire Monday as she rode on a tour bus on the U.S. Virgin Islands, police said. Authorities said the shooting happened just before noon in the Coki Point area of St. Thomas. They found the girl wounded on the bus and a man who had been fatally shot in the street, police said in a statement.

292,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A trio of wildfires burned through Southern California on Tuesday, threatening homes, shutting down roads and prompting some residents to evacuate, officials said. There were no reports of injuries from the three fires in Camarillo, Walnut and at Camp Pendleton. Capt. Ron Oatman of the Ventura County Fire Department estimated the fire in Camarillo -- about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles -- to be about 15-20 acres. Oatman said some homes were threatened, but residents were not yet evacuating. In Walnut, 25 miles east of Los Angeles, a 5-acre wildfire prompted residents in 24 homes to evacuate, though the fire was later extinguished without burning any structures, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Meanwhile, fire officials at Camp Pendleton -- home to a U.S. Marine Corps base north of San Diego -- had that blaze 60 percent contained Tuesday evening after it burned 2,700 acres. Firefighters expect to have it fully controlled Wednesday, according to a statement from the base. The Camp Pendleton fire, which started Tuesday morning during a training exercise, forced the closure of at least one road that will remain closed through the night, the statement said. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.","There are no reports of injuries .

293,"(CNN) -- Michele Witte woke up about 1 a.m. on December 12, 1997, and went to change her son's diaper. Then she rocked him and laid her 10-month-old back in his crib. Later that morning, she went into his bedroom to wake him and found his lifeless body. She immediately fell to her knees screaming. Witte's son, Tyler, had gotten his neck stuck in a gap between the side rail and headboard created when a single screw had become loose. She called 911, but her baby boy was cold, and she knew in her heart he was already dead. As her 2-year-old daughter came bounding into the bedroom, she grabbed her so she wouldn't see her brother. Witte, an English teacher in Bellmore, New York, said the coroner ruled the death an accident, but she and her family notified the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Thirteen years later, the commission voted Wednesday in favor of new proposed mandatory standards for cribs. The new rules, likely to go into effect next year after a final vote by the federal commission, would render many cribs in the country as not up to code, regardless of whether the crib style and model was ever considered unsafe, and essentially would ban the manufacture and sale of drop-side cribs. In addition to eliminating drop-side cribs, the new rules will mandate better mattress support, sturdier hardware and better quality wood for crib construction. Between November 2007 and April of this year, there were 36 deaths associated with crib structural problems, according to Commission Chairwoman Inez Tenenbaum. Hazards in cribs include faulty hardware, dangerous gaps created from mattress support failures, and poor wood quality with crib slats that can be broken easily. The new standards aim to eliminate gaps where babies could become entrapped and suffocate, and to prevent babies from falling out of the crib. After Tyler's death, Witte, now 36, began to believe it was an isolated incident after a series of frustrating conversations and research. But in 2004, Witte heard about another couple whose baby had died in a drop-side crib just miles from her Bellmore home. She was outraged that the accidents continued to happen and ramped up her advocacy efforts. ""The coroner said it would take 15 seconds for him to asphyxiate,"" she said, her voice quivering with the memory of Tyler's death. ""My bedroom was close. I had the baby monitor on, but it's the silent killer. If you can't breathe, you can't scream out."" While Witte said she is happy about the latest developments, she is still worried about parents who have drop-side cribs. Since the accidents first started getting attention years ago, Witte said she's heard of some parents who let their babies sleep in beds with them, which the American Academy of Pediatrics discourages. Others have used duct tape or lodged their cribs against a wall. ""What does that mean for cribs already out there?"" she said. ""We need to have new safe cribs for people who can't afford it."" Witte's oldest daughter, now 14, slept in the oak crib with steel hardware that kiled her baby brother. Since then, Witte has had two more children, a girl, now 6, and a boy, 1. Both have slept in a new stationary crib with no movable parts. In fact Witte said the current crib will only come apart now with a sledgehammer. ""The problem is of hardware. Whenever you have something you are moving, the hardware is bound to fail,"" she said. When Witte puts her son down to sleep tonight, she will face the same stress she has dealt with for years. ""The safest places for a baby is safe, securely built, stationary crib,"" she said, adding that she has a video monitor in her son's room and gets up ""about 14 times a night checking on him."" ""I'm happy for the day when he's out and in the bed, and we're done with cribs.""","Michele Witte's 10-month-old son suffocated in a drop-side crib in 1997 .

294,"(CNN) -- An explosion and fire at a U.S. Steel plant in Clairton, Pennsylvania, Wednesday injured at least 15 people, an Allegheny County Emergency Management spokesman told CNN. Kevin Evanto said authorities got a 911 call shortly after 9:30 a.m. reporting the blast at the United States Steel Corporation's Clairton Plant, which the company says is the largest coke manufacturing facility in the United States. ""It appears one of the coke ovens at the plant exploded,"" Evanto said. Most of the injuries are burn-related, he said, although one person was taken to the hospital with chest pains. Victims are being treated at various hospitals in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area, Evanto added, with one person being transported by helicopter. ""At this point, we believe everybody is accounted for,"" the spokesman said. The United States Steel Corporation told CNN in an e-mail Wednesday it is investigating the incident. ""U. S. Steel's Security & Fire Protection Services personnel are working with local emergency responders,"" wrote company spokeswoman Erin DiPietro. ""We will assess the extent of repairs and impact on operations at a later time."" The plant has 12 coke oven batteries that produce approximately 4.7 million tons of coke annually, according to the United States Steel Corporation website. The ovens heat coal at extremely high temperatures to carbonize it so it becomes coke -- a fuel used for producing steel. Fire crews were still on the scene at midday, extinguishing remaining flames, Evanto said. Video from CNN affiliate WPXI showed ambulances and emergency crews in front of the coke plant. It also showed a side of the facility that was missing an entire wall, with cinder blocks strewn across a wide area. The plant is located about 15 miles south of Pittsburgh. CNN's Mark Bixler, Stephanie Gallman & Mythili Rao contributed to this report.","15 people were hurt in a coke plant explosion, an emergency spokesman says .

295,"New York (CNN) -- Four hundred Canada geese from Brooklyn's Prospect Park were herded into crates and euthanized last week in an effort to reduce their number near New York's airports, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture. Measures to lower the number of Canada geese close to John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia international airports have been in place since last summer, said Carol Bannerman, spokeswoman for the USDA's Wildlife Services. New York City officials asked for federal assistance with solving the goose problem after US Airways flight 1549 was cripped by a bird strike and narrowly avoided crashing by successfully landing in the Hudson River in January 2009. ""Our responsibility is to look at safety hazards and the Canada geese can represent a significant aviation hazard,"" Bannerman said. The round-up last week came to light in New York media on Tuesday. The group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) issued a statement criticizing the euthanization and calling on authorities to use other methods to keep birds away from airports. ""Killing every goose within a seven-mile radius of an airport doesn't fly -- it isn't humane, and it isn't a viable solution for either people or birds,"" PETA said in the statement. ""When geese are killed, more birds simply move in to use available resources, and the temporary spike in the food supply results in accelerated breeding. What follows is a vicious killing cycle that is cruel, expensive, and pointless."" The group cited other methods including a radar system at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to detect flocks of birds, as well as lasers and pyrotechnics, as being better ways to change birds' flight paths. The Brooklyn geese, which are molting at this time of year and cannot fly, were herded into a fenced area, put in poultry crates and taken to a facility where they were euthanized with carbon dioxide, said Bannerman. The geese were later bagged and buried in a landfill, she said. Last month the radius from JFK and LaGuardia airports where Canada geese would be removed and euthanized was increased from five to seven miles and Bannerman said the new radius included Brooklyn's Prospect Park. ""JFK and LaGuardia are between six and seven miles from Prospect Park border-to-border,"" she said adding that she understood that attachment that people in the area have to the geese. ""We made the process as least stressful as possible for the geese,"" she said. Ed Bahlman, who said he is 60 years old and has been going to Prospect Park most of his life, called the removal of the geese ""unnecessary."" He said that he and his companion go to the park most mornings at around 7 a.m, and had started feeding a goose they called ""Beaky"" early last year. The goose had lost it's upper beak to a fishing hook. ""On Wednesday all the geese were there, we fed Beaky and on Thursday they were gone. Beaky was gone, too,"" he said. Bahlman who said he found zip ties and rope in the park said that the authorities had accomplished nothing by killing the geese. ""They have done a lot of harm and we don't believe they have done anything to help the public, they've done more harm than good,"" he said. Peter Brown, who said he was a fireman who has lived in the area all his life and goes to the park regularly with his 10 year old son said that although he thought the geese were beautiful and understood that it had upset the neighborhood, he agreed with the decision to remove them. ""What's more important, 200 geese or 200 people? That's the choice that has to be made,"" he said adding that he flies frequently. Bannerman said Canada geese were responsible for over 600 damaging airstrikes to U.S. planes between 1990 and 2008, and that their population was rapidly increasing. ""The Canada goose population increased from 19,000 in 1981 to 250,000 in 2008, making it a 12-fold increases in almost 30 years,"" she said. Bannerman said that 1,200 Canada geese were euthanized in 2009 in 17 New York locations.","The geese were euthanized by carbon dioxide .

296,"(CNN) -- A car bomb killed at least four people in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, authorities said. It was the first time a car bomb has been used to attack federal police, said the city's mayor, Jose Reyes Ferriz. The incident happened about 8 p.m. Thursday in the city's most violent zone. Juarez municipal police spokesman Jacinto Seguro said Friday that federal police were responding to a call that a police officer had been killed. ""When they went to check the car, there was a dead body in there, dressed up like a police officer, but it wasn't one of ours,"" Seguro said. ""They put him in a civilian car but dressed him up in a municipal police uniform. That's when the bomb went off. It's like an act of terrorism."" Two police officers, a paramedic and a civilian were killed, federal police spokesman Ramon Salinas said. Six people, including a local news cameraman, were injured in the blast, authorities said. Four people -- three paramedics and a civilian -- were still being treated for injuries, police said. It was unclear how severe the injuries are. Canal 5 video footage from moments after the blast captures seconds of confusion, followed by fires and debris scattered across the street. At one point, the cameraman shooting the video reaches for an injured civilian, and a police officer says, ""Grab onto my arm. Grab onto my arm."" Although Mexican authorities say the attack was the result of a car bomb, a counterterrorism expert said there is ""some confusion"" about exactly what caused the car to explode. ""For this to be an improvised grenade attack, in some capacity, it doesn't surprise me,"" said Fred Burton, vice president of intelligence at Stratfor, a privately owned global Intelligence service. But if this particular car bomb was manufactured to the level of sophistication similar to those used by terrorist groups like Hezbollah, then this is a significant event, Burton said. ""The devil is in the details,"" he added. Jose Marulanda, a security analyst based in Bogota, Colombia, called Friday's bombing a ""turning point"" in Mexico's drug war and found it remniscent of Colombia's own battle with cartels and car bombs in the 1990s. ""Because if they decide to start using car bombs one against the other ... then the whole society, bystanders, innocent people could be affected,"" he told CNN. He said that while Friday's car bombing did not appear very sophisticated, he noted that Mexican drug cartels are often advised by former members of Colombian cartels. He said the Colombian cartels are influenced by FARC, the guerrilla group which has waged war against the Colombian government for decades and ""has a lot of experience with explosives."" ""We could expect more sophistication day after day if they decided to go on with these car bombs,"" he said. According to Seguro, the Juarez cartel claimed the deadly incident in a graffiti message found in downtown Juarez. In what appears to be black spray paint, the violent drug cartel wrote, ""what happened on September avenue will keep happening to all the authorities who keep supporting El Chapo. Sincerely - the Juarez cartel."" The threatening message concluded: ""We still have car bombs."" ""This is significant because usually it's La Linea, the Juarez cartel's operatives, that sign the messages,"" Reyes said. ""It's as if to say, 'Now, it's the big guys in charge, not the operatives.'"" Salinas said the blast in the Mexican border city took place as authorities were responding to ""some sort of emergency."" Earlier in the day, police announced the arrest of Jesus Armando Acosta Guerrero, believed to be a leader in the Juarez cartel -- one of two drug trafficking organizations operating in the area. There had been relative calm in the city since elections were held there July 4. But Thursday's explosion and an attack Sunday against Mexican federal police mark the third and fourth major incidents in recent weeks. On June 29, a shooting between suspected drug traffickers and Mexican federal police left one officer dead. The shooting was seen as a watershed moment in the ongoing border drug war: Several bullets from that gunfight strayed across the border into Texas, hitting El Paso City Hall. There were no injuries reported on the U.S. side. On April 24, six federal police officers were killed in a daylight shooting in Juarez. Hours later, a painted message found in the city, allegedly from members of La Linea, claimed responsibility for the attack. La Linea is an extension of the Juarez cartel, made up in part of former Juarez police officers, according to authorities. Assaults against federal police have increased since they took full control of security in the city from the Mexican military on April 9. ""There have been at least a dozen, maybe 15, attacks against the federal police since we took over"" security, Salinas said. The Juarez cartel and the Sinaloa cartel have been in a bloody turf war since 2008. More than 5,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence in Juarez during the turf war, according to local authorities.

297,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- The verdict so far: generally good news but still some uncertainty about whether there's a leak in BP's well in the Gulf of Mexico, now fitted with a containment cap. That's the assessment of the retired Coast Guard admiral overseeing the government's response to the oil spill, more than 24 hours into a critical test checking the well's ability to hold up under pressure. Thad Allen reported Friday afternoon that pressure is rising in the well, a sign that the well is holding and that the leak that had been spewing oil into the Gulf for nearly three months can be contained. But pressure readings have not reached the optimal level. Pressure was up to 6,700 pounds per square inch inside the well's capping stack, he said. More than a day into the ""well integrity"" test, pressure above 7,500 pounds per square inch would indicate ""high integrity and low potential for a leak,"" according to Allen. What does 6,700 pounds per square inch mean? Government scientists and BP experts aren't quite sure. It could be a leak, or it could simply be that so much oil has spilled out already, it's taking a while to build up pressure. ""In general, as the president noted today, this is generally good news,"" Allen said. But he added, ""I think we're at a point where there's enough uncertainty about the meaning of the pressure that we're seeing that we have to use due diligence moving forward. We don't want to do harm or create a situation that cannot be reversed."" Allen said the government has told BP to proceed with the test but intensify monitoring of the well, by conducting seismic and acoustic tests and visual inspections of the sea floor using robots. In addition, a government ship is in the area, fitted with equipment for detecting methane gas, which would be an indication of a leak. The ""well integrity test"" began Thursday after two days of delays, first as government scientists scrutinized testing procedures and then as BP replaced a leaking piece of equipment known as a choke line. The oil stopped gushing out Thursday afternoon, the first time BP has been able to gain control since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 and triggered the catastrophe. All that was made possible by a new, tightly fitting containment cap. BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said later in a telephone conference following Allen's that two robots trolling the sea floor in the area of the well bore and two others capturing sonar data have not detected any breaching. ""At this point, there is no evidence the well bore has been breached, so that's good news,"" he said. ""The current monitoring that we do shows no negative evidence."" He said the well integrity test is proceeding as planned, and the pressure readings so far, while not optimal, are ""consistent with BP's engineering analysis"" and ""do not give us any indication that we do not have well integrity."" Wells said also said that work restarted Friday on the drilling of the first of two relief wells, seen as a more permanent way to plug and seal the breached well. They're expected to be completed in August. One serves as a backup to the other. When they are ready, mud and cement will be pumped into one of the relief wells to permanently seal BP's crippled well. Allen and BP officials initially had said that the test results would be closely scrutinized at six-hour intervals and that the integrity test could go on for 48 hours. But at this point, they're focusing on each six hours, with no guarantee the test will last two days. When the test is wrapped up, valves are expected to be reopened to resume siphoning oil to two ships on the surface, the Q4000 and Helix Producer, as government and BP officials assess the data and decide what to do next. Two more ships are due to join them in coming weeks, bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels (about 3.4 million gallons) of oil a day, more than high-end estimates of how much oil had been leaking. But it's possible some oil may be released into the Gulf again, before all the ships are ready. As results came in Friday morning, President Barack Obama spoke about the developments with a note of caution. ""I think it's important that we don't get ahead of ourselves here,"" he said. ""You know, one of the problems with having this camera down there is that when the oil stops gushing, everybody feels like we're done, and we're not. We won't be done until we actually know that we killed the well and have a permanent solution in place."" The president expects to return to the Gulf Coast in the next few weeks. The White House announced that first lady Michelle Obama will return to the Gulf region next week to meet with Coast Guard personnel who've been responding to the oil spill and to christen a Coast Guard cutter named in honor of Dorothy Stratton, the service branch's first female commissioned officer. The visit will take place in Mississippi on Friday. Meanwhile, Gulf residents are happy simply that no oil is being released now. ""See the smile? That's my reaction,"" Jamie Munoz said. ""But it's cautious optimism. Obviously, I'm very happy. It's been our goal for 88 days now. It's been a long run. But, hopefully, we get it done right and begin the cleaning. That's the most important part. Let's clean up and get our fishermen back to work."" BP also reported that it has paid more than $200 million in claims to 32,000 Gulf Coast residents. The largest groups of claimants include fishermen, who have received $32 million, and shrimpers, who have received $18 million, the company said in a news release. It said that about $77 million has been paid for loss of income to workers on ships, at seafood processing plants and other businesses. .","NEW: BP official: No indication we don't have well integrity .

299,"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama told reporters Friday he did not feel the earthquake that rattled parts of suburban Washington early in the morning. The rare quake, which struck about 5 a.m., was centered about 20 miles northwest of the capital, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It had a magnitude of 3.6 -- relatively mild by earthquake standards but stronger than any other quake to shake the region in the past 35 years, the agency said. Steve Dolce, a CNN technical manager, said his house in Germantown, Maryland, ""vibrated slightly"" for about 10 seconds. ""I looked out the window ... wondered if it was a plane or something, then I checked my BlackBerry and saw a dozen e-mails alerting the small quake,"" he added. The earthquake was the first with a magnitude of more than 3 near Washington since 1974, said Amy Vaughan, a geophysicist at the USGS National Earthquake Information Center. ""This is a significant event for the region,"" she said. About an hour after the quake, Vaughan said, more than 5,500 people had reported feeling it across Maryland, in nearby Washington, and in states including West Virginia, Virginia and Delaware. ""It was really loud, like a plane flying really low. I had never felt anything like it,"" said Anne Ngunjiri, 30, of Gaithersburg, Maryland. ""I was jolted out of bed. All my neighbors woke up. After it passed, I thought it could be an earthquake, and lay in bed hoping there were no aftershocks."" Judy Rudolph, 64, said she was writing e-mails in bed in Rockville, Maryland, when her house started to shake. ""My first reaction was the noise ... I thought it was an explosion,"" she said. She said she'd never felt anything like it in her 31 years living there. Until Friday, the largest earthquake recorded within about 50 miles of Gaithersberg since 1974 was a 2.7-magnitude quake in 1993, Vaughan said. But geologically speaking, she said it was ""not completely unexpected"" for a 3.6-magnitude quake to hit there. ""Occasionally these things do happen even east of the Rockies, even though it's not really on a plate boundary where we expect earthquakes. ... Faults do exist from when the continent was forming. There are small faults that do exist within this area,"" she said. Vaughan said major structural damage was unlikely, but people may experience aftershocks for the next day, or even a week or two after the quake. Washington's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency said no injuries or property damage had been reported. The last earthquake in Maryland occurred on October 8, 2007, according to the USGS website. It was a 1.7-magnitude quake centered about 5 miles northwest of Baltimore.

300,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Equipment that the oil company BP was using to help stop the massive oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico is leaking -- another setback for the beleaguered company in its hope of stopping this disaster. The company will need to fix the leak before it can run crucial tests that could show whether an end finally is in sight to the environmental disaster, the company said. There was no timetable for when the leak was to be fixed, a company spokesman said early Thursday morning. Earlier, BP was proceeding with the critical test of its crippled well in the Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. government had told BP Tuesday to proceed with the ""integrity"" test on the well in the Gulf of Mexico, and BP had begun the process of shutting off valves on its new capping stack, to see whether the well can hold the pressure. It's hoped the tests, whenever they begin, will show whether the well can be contained -- either by closing the 30-foot, 75-ton cap stack or siphoning off oil to the surface. That could signal a beginning of an end to the catastrophe that began when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded April 20, killing 11 workers and launching the relentless oil spill. But even if the well is contained, the cleanup could take years. Retired Adm. Thad Allen, who is heading the government's response to the oil spill, announced Wednesday the test had been given a green light, after it was delayed for a day so that procedures could be scrutinized. He said that after intense consultations with Energy Secretary Steven Chu and other scientists involved, ""At this time we'll be releasing an order to BP to proceed with the well integrity test. But we gave them some additional direction to make sure we were are taking due care and in some cases an overabundance of caution, to make sure we didn't do any irreversible harm to the well as we proceed."" Allen said the officials ""sat long and hard about delaying the test"" and it was ""not easy"" to decide to delay. He said they wanted to make sure they're ""getting this right"" for this ""significant event."" Allen added the earlier delay was not prompted by the White House. ""We advised the White House that we decided to take a 24-hour break. It was us advising them that we thought it was the right thing to do. We briefed them,"" he said. BP's Senior Vice President Kent Wells reported shortly after Allen spoke that the middle valve of the three-valve stack had been closed. That's an initial step in the complicated process of closing off the well and checking pressure to see how it's holding. A key question was whether shutting the well was worth the risk, or whether it might damage the well bore. Allen said the test would be a stop-and-go process. It involves incrementally closing three valves on the new cap while testing pressure, a process that could unfold could over two days. Higher pressure readings would mean the leak is being stopped, while lower pressure indications would mean oil is escaping from other parts of the well. It was not clear early Thursday if the new leak was discovered by a lower pressure reading. The massive cap, which has a better seal than the last cap placed on the well, is about three stories high and weighs 160,000 pounds. If the well can't be shut off completely, oil could be diverted through riser pipes to ships on the surface. The Helix Producer and Q4000 currently are at the surface, but it might take several weeks before two more ships can be brought in to contain all the flow. Allen said a four-vessel system could recover up to 80,000 barrels (3.3 million gallons) a day, more than the high-end estimates of the well's flow rate. Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels (1.4 to 2.5 million gallons) of oil have spewed daily from BP's breached well. Wells said the Helix Producer is ramping up production and recovered about 9,200 barrels (386,400 gallons) on Tuesday. The test is called an integrity test because it is aimed at ensuring the well bore has enough integrity to hold the pressure in the well when it is closed. ""In this exercise, high pressure is good,"" Allen said. ""We are looking for somewhere between 8- and 9,000 [pounds per square inch] inside the capping stack, which would indicate to us that the hydrocarbons are being forced up and the well bore's being able to withstand that pressure."" Allen said that if low pressure readings persist for around a six-hour time frame, that could signal problems with the new cap. Meanwhile, two relief wells are seen as the ultimate solution to the oil disaster. They're expected to be completed in August. Wells had said Tuesday that work on the relief wells was being delayed while officials prepared for the integrity test, noting that ""it's a good precaution to take."" But Allen said Wednesday in his briefing the government hasn't ordered BP to halt work on the relief wells. ""They are going very slowly. They haven't stopped,"" he said. He did say that operations on the second relief well were temporarily suspended at a depth of 15,963 feet to ensure there is no interference with the first relief well. The second relief well is a backup to the first. When the relief well does intercept the crippled well, heavy mud and then cement would be pumped in to seal it permanently. Allen cautions that even if the engineering containment efforts work, there is still a lot to be done in a disaster that has affected the environment and the livelihoods of people from Louisiana to Florida. ""There's still a significant amount of oil out there, and the oil recovery and the impacts of this oil will probably extend well into the fall in terms of oil coming ashore, tar balls, beach cleanup, and then we will be ... trying to understand the long-term environmental/ecological impact of the event,"" he said.

301,"London, England (CNN) -- Fugitive Raoul Moat, wanted for the shootings of three people in northern England last weekend, died early Saturday after shooting himself, police said. Moat, 37, shot himself around 1:15 a.m. (8:15 p.m. ET Friday), Northumbria Police said. No gunshots were fired by police, and Moat was pronounced dead around 2:20 a.m., they said. A spokeswoman at Newcastle General Hospital confirmed Moat died shortly after arriving there. His death brought to an end a week-long manhunt that had the small northern English town of Rothbury on lockdown and dominated national news headlines. Moat, released from prison last Thursday after serving time for assault, allegedly shot and wounded his former girlfriend and killed her new partner last Saturday. He allegedly shot and wounded a police officer the next day. Convinced Moat was hiding in the area, police launched a manhunt focused around Rothbury and found several sites where they believed he had been sleeping. British news outlets reported police found letters at those sites in which he made rambling threats to police. The large-scale search involved a number of police units across Northumbria in northern England, including specialist search teams, armed response units, helicopters and dog handlers, according to police officials. It came to a head Friday evening when police discovered a man fitting Moat's description near a riverbank around Rothbury, said Chief Superintendent Mark Dennett of the Northumbria police. ""When he was discovered, he was armed,"" Dennett said. ""Expert negotiators were brought in to speak to him, and spoke to him extensively for several hours."" Speaking at a  press conference Saturday, Temporary Chief Constable Sue Sim confirmed Moat had  died after a single gunshot. She said no  shots had been fired by police, but that officers had fired a  taser. ""Right up  until that time police officers were striving to persuade Mr. Moat to give  himself up peacefully. During  this time, officers discharged  a taser. However, this did not prevent his  death,"" she  said. Witnesses described seeing the man, believed to be Moat, with a shotgun-like weapon aimed at his neck while armed police gathered feet away to speak to him. Because police had contact with Moat before he died, the incident has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is standard in such cases, Northumbria Police said. ""While the incident has been brought to a close, we must be mindful of the impact it has had on many lives,"" Sim said. ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those affected."" British news outlets reported Saturday that police had asked for a media blackout during the investigation because Moat had threatened the public. Among the details they were asked to keep secret was the discovery of a four-hour dictaphone recording in which Moat complained about media coverage of the manhunt, shootings, and his private life. He threatened to harm a member of the public -- perhaps journalists -- for every piece of information he perceived to be inaccurate, CNN affiliate ITN reported. Police were concerned that reports could anger Moat and trigger further violence, the Press Association reported. Police also asked for stories already published about his personal life to be removed from news websites, the PA said. They included stories about Moat's mother, Josephine Healey -- who hadn't seen her son in years -- saying he would be ""better off dead,"" the PA said. In messages posted on his Facebook page after his release from prison, Moat said he was upset that his girlfriend was with a new partner, according to British news outlets. ""Just got out the slammer,"" Moat wrote Friday morning, according to Channel 4 News, which said it had been given access to Moat's page. Eleven minutes later, Moat wrote, ""Lost my business. Kids to (social) services. Gonna lose my home and lost my mrs of nearly 6 years to a copper. How did a guy who had it all end up in this situation."" Police later said the man Moat killed -- his ex-girlfriend's partner -- was not a police officer. The most recent pictures police had of Moat were taken on surveillance cameras as he shopped at a building supply store on Friday evening. Moat's ex-girlfriend and the wounded police officer remain in the hospital.","Raoul Moat was wanted in the shooting of three people last weekend .

302,"(CNN) -- Power outages in Connecticut, rail service disruptions in Washington and warnings to conserve electricity in New York City mark the second day of the Northeast heat wave. As many as 9,000 customers of Connecticut Light and Power in Stamford were without electrical service Tuesday, according to the power company's website. A heat-related transformer failure at a substation in Stamford caused the outage, according to a spokeswoman for the utility company. Temperatures reached 100 Tuesday in Stamford, according to the National Weather Service. In Washington, at least one rail line was delayed when Metrorail officials found a ""heat kink"" on the Red Line. A kink occurs in extremely hot weather when overheated tracks expand but can't be constrained by cross ties or ballast, and when a kink is found, train speed is reduced to ensure passenger safety, Metro said. Track inspectors will continue to monitor all conditions should other tracks become affected. New York  residents -- advised by Con Ed Power to conserve electricity during the heat wave -- did just that, company spokeswoman Joy Faber said. ""No usage records  were broken in the city or  the state,"" she said Tuesday. Earlier in the day at  a media briefing with reporters, a Con Ed official had feared that  Tuesday's usage rate would surpass  the record of 13,141 megawatts set in August of  2006. Faber said later that usage peaked Tuesday -- as New York temperatures hit 103 degrees in some places, according to the National Weather Service -- at 12, 963 megawatts. Even without a record-setting day, residents were still being encouraged to cut back  on electricity consumption, officials said. ""Postpone using  large appliances, turn out lights, use fans instead of air conditioners, or  if you have to use an air  conditioner, set it at 78 (degrees),"" said Con Ed spokesman John Miksad. ""This is a team effort,"" he said. ""We will get through this."" As many as 400 cooling stations have opened in New York's five boroughs, according to the Office of Emergency Management. OEM Commissioner Joe Bruno urged people to utilize the center, and advised neighbors to check on neighbors to make sure they are well. ""This is a significant health emergency as well as a heat emergency,"" Bruno said. The heat wave has claimed one life. A 92-year-old woman was found dead in her home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to the medical examiner's office. The woman, who was found by a neighbor, had opened a few windows in her home but did not have air conditioning, said a medical examiner's spokesman. Heat advisories remain in effect through Wednesday evening for much of the Northeast, according to the National Weather Service, which also issued an additional ""excessive heat warning"" to be in effect until 8 p.m. Wednesday for Philadelphia; Trenton, New Jersey; and parts of Delaware. Weather service officials are advising people to stay indoors as the prolonged heat and humidity creates a ""dangerous situation."" ""Be sure to check on your elderly relatives and neighbors. Coaches, trainers, camp counselors should remain alert for signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke,"" the weather service warned.","NEW: Conservation calls being heeded in New York, Con Ed says .

303,"(CNN) -- A 109,305-acre fire, mostly on the grounds of a U.S. Energy Department facility containing a nuclear fuel development complex, has been fully contained, according to the government's InciWeb fire incident information website. The so-called Jefferson Fire, at the Idaho National Laboratory, about 40 miles west of Idaho Falls, had been burning since Tuesday afternoon, driven by winds up to 45 mph. The cause is still unknown. InciWeb had said as of early Thursday afternoon, the fire was 60 percent contained. Sarah Wheeler, a Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman, confirmed the fire had burned a few hundred acres more while crews contained the final 40 percent of the blaze. ""That's hard to do working 10 miles of fire line,"" she said. The 142 personnel on site planned on patrolling, mopping up and monitoring the situation Friday, the InciWeb site said. About 80 percent of the charred land belongs to the Idaho National Laboratory, an applied engineering lab supporting the Energy Department's missions in nuclear and energy research, science and national defense. During the fire, as a precautionary measure, the lab shut down power to the Materials and Fuels Complex, a nuclear research center, Wheeler said. That power has since been restored, she said.

304,"(CNN) -- Waters were receding Sunday as rescue crews conducted searches in the aftermath of flash flooding in eastern Kentucky that killed at least two people, a top county official said. Pike County Judge-Executive Wayne Rutherford confirmed the two fatalities Sunday, and estimated that 200 homes in the area were damaged or destroyed. Earlier in the day, another Pike County official, Charles Maynard, told CNN that there were three fatalities -- two males and one female. The names and details of the incidents were not immediately released, pending notification of family members. Rutherford said the county will send nine assessment teams Monday to gauge damage so a report could be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for assistance. Several major roads and bridges in in the area were damaged, he said. Crews in Pike County worked throughout the night in boats to rescue people from homes after flash flooding in the area, officials said. ""Raccoon Creek in Pike County is probably the hardest hit,"" Emergency Management Director Doug Tackett said. ""It's pretty much all devastation in that area and I think most of the mobile homes aren't there anymore, and some homes were completely washed away."" Crews started door-to-door searches and welfare checks in the Appalachian county to look for anyone that may be injured or needs to be evacuated, and to make sure families are accounted for, Tackett said. There was no specific number of missing people, Maynard said, but searches in the Raccoon Creek area continued. About 5,000 people were affected, and there were a number of high water rescues and several evacuations, Tackett said. ""I know there were some people taken from cars in swift water, and a few folks were taken from roofs of their homes or from windows to be removed from their homes,"" Tackett said. As the water began to recede, the county faced another problem: One of the major water intake plants in the county was damaged and unusable. ""It looks like about 4,000 customers will be without water for about a week, so we're setting up distribution centers for folk to make sure they have drinking water,"" Tackett said. CNN's Rick Vincent and John Branch contributed to this report.","NEW: Two people are confirmed dead .

305,"(CNN) -- President Obama and his family leave Friday for a weekend getaway to Maine, but along with a little rest and relaxation comes criticism that the president is taking it easy while oil continues to gush in the Gulf of Mexico. The Obamas plan to spend the weekend on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia National Park. The trip marks the president's third vacation since the oil disaster began in April. The Republican National Convention launched a website blasting what it considers Obama's ""leisure activities or missteps"" during the oil disaster, like playing golf, attending concerts and vacationing in Asheville, North Carolina; Chicago, Illinois; and now Maine. Obama has also faced criticism for scheduling a trip up north, instead of vacationing in the Gulf, as he advised other Americans to do. ""Presidents are certainly entitled to vacation, just like everybody else, but there is a fine line as to when presidents should do it, what they should and where they should do it,"" said Brad Blakeman, a former member of President George W. Bush's senior staff and the deputy assistant for appointments and scheduling. ""Presidents have to be cognizant of the fact that everything they do is going to be scrutinized,"" said Blakeman, who also is a professor for Georgetown University's Semester in Washington program. Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons said the Republican criticism is ""galling,"" considering Bush's frequent trips to Camp David and his home in Crawford, Texas. ""Barack Obama is working as hard as any president that we've had in recent history and certainly harder than the most immediate previous president,"" he said. CBS's Mark Knoller, who keeps track of presidents' comings and goings, calculated that Bush spent all or part of 977 days at Camp David or in Texas during his two terms. Blakeman noted that visits to those locations were working trips and not getaways. Bush's staff would travel with him, and work would continue as usual. The Crawford ranch was known as the ""Western White House"" because of the infrastructure there. As for calls that Obama should vacation in the Gulf, Simmons said, ""Where he chooses to take his days off should really be up to him. We don't want to get into a situation where the president is making familial vacation decisions based upon polling or political maneuvers."" Scott Stanzel, Bush's deputy press secretary who often traveled with the president when he was away from the White House, said that changing locations provided a good opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle of Washington. ""President Bush, on the weekends, would often go to Camp David because the size of the bubble you are in expands, so you can go out for a walk or bike ride without having to arrange security detail,"" he said. Stanzel was in Crawford with Bush for a number of crises that could not have been planned for, like the conviction of Saddam Hussein, the death of President Ford and the assassination of Pakistani politician Benazir Bhutto. Bush was notified of Bhutto's death immediately and delivered a statement to the press pool. ""It would have almost been like we were at the White House in terms of the teams that would convene and talk about the issues surrounding that assassination,"" Stanzel said. The problem for Obama, Stanzel said, is the visuals that could come out of his trip. A picture of Obama playing golf alongside images from the Gulf could send a negative message. Paul Begala, a CNN contributor and former adviser to President Clinton, said that vacationing or not, ""The president is the president wherever he is. ""I thought it was silly when people attacked Bush for going on vacation, so I'll be consistent and say it's silly when people attack President Obama for going on vacation,"" he said. ""Of all of the concerns that Americans may have, they do not need to worry whether President Obama is a hard-working man. They may agree or disagree with his policies, but there is just no doubt that the guy is busting his rear end.""","Obama and family going to Mount Desert Island, Maine, for the weekend .

306,"Washington (CNN) -- Unmanned aircraft patrolling the nation's borders have an accident rate seven times greater than general aviation aircraft, and hundreds of times greater than the rate of jetliners, federal officials said Thursday in urging caution in expanding the use of pilotless planes. Unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, have proven remarkably useful in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan, but are difficult to integrate into U.S. skies, the most complex airspace in the world, FAA official Nancy Kalinowski said in testimony before a House Homeland Security subcommittee. Kalinowski said the accident rates for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) aircraft are based on a relatively limited use of the planes -- only 5,688 flight hours. But because of the limited data, ""the FAA must make conservative decisions"" concerning integrating UAVs into U.S. skies, Kalinowski said. It is the FAA's responsibility to ensure the safety of other planes in the sky as well as people on the ground, she said. Increasingly, government agencies, police departments and private businesses have pushed the FAA for expanded use of UAVs. CBP currently operates six UAVs and will get a seventh by the end of the year. The CBP accident rate is 52.7 accidents per 100,000 flight hours, Kalinowski said. The accident rate for general aviation aircraft is 7.11 accidents per 100,000 flight hours, and 0.149 accidents for commercial aircraft. Public operators of UAVs such as the government and universities must obtain a special FAA certificate of waiver or authorization before operating in U.S. civil airspace. Civil users can get permits for research and development, demonstrations and crew training, but commercial UAV operations are not permitted at this time.","Unmanned aircraft have higher accident rates than regular aircraft .

307,"(CNN) -- Two Minnesota state lawmakers said Friday that they have reached a deal to compensate victims of the Interstate 35 bridge collapse that killed 13 people in Minneapolis last year. Thirteen people were killed and dozens were injured in last year's collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota. State Sen. Ron Latz and state Rep. Ryan Winkler told CNN Radio that the deal totals $38 million and will be presented to the Legislature for approval. Latz said the deal would expedite compensation to victims who chose to take their portion of the settlement and waive their right to sue the state. The plan addresses a key sticking point in negotiations: preserving a state liability cap on awards to individual victims, Latz said. Winkler said victims will be able to collect up to $400,000 and people whose damages exceed $400,000 will be able to pull from a supplemental pool of more than $12 million. ""There are a 182 potential claimants out there,"" Winkler said. ""There were 13 dead, and there were 12 catastrophic injury cases."" Gov. Tim Pawlenty said he would welcome the deal for survivors and relatives if the Legislature approves it. ""I look forward to signing this legislation into law,"" Pawlenty said in a statement. ""It provides needed relief and support for victims and family members directly impacted by the I-35W bridge tragedy. I'm pleased that Senator Latz, Representative Winkler, my office and others were able to work together to craft this legislation."" The bridge collapsed during afternoon rush hour August 1, sending dozens of cars tumbling into the Mississippi River. Photos of the scene showed cars, trucks and a school bus lingering on the bridge's uneven remnants. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating why the bridge collapsed. In January, NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said investigators studying the bridge found that 16 gusset plates, which strengthen the junctions of steel beams, were fractured. The bad gussets were found at eight joints in the main center span. ""When one element began to fail, it's like dominoes falling down,"" Rosenker said. But he emphasized, ""We have not yet determined the probable cause of this accident."" The final report should be ready by the end of the year, he said.

308,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, may have killed as many as 17,000 Americans, according to new estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. Though 2,498 confirmed deaths linked to the H1N1 virus had been reported to the CDC as of January 30, the agency estimates that between 8,330 and 17,160 people actually have died from H1N1. The overwhelming majority of the people who died -- between 6,390 and 13,170 -- were 18 to 64 years old, the CDC estimates. Between 880 and 1,810 children 17 years old and younger also died from this flu, according to CDC estimates. In comparison, the CDC says that in a regular flu season, about 36,000 people in the United States die from seasonal flu, with 90 percent of the deaths usually occurring in people age 65 and older. Since this new flu virus emerged in April 2009, health officials have recognized that the reported numbers of people who have been hospitalized and died provide only a partial picture of the full outbreak. Underreporting of influenza cases and deaths is common, especially in the early weeks or months of an outbreak. By mid-July last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) no longer recommended that countries with known H1N1 transmission test everybody who had flulike symptoms, as laboratories were being overwhelmed. Patients were to be diagnosed based on symptoms alone, since nearly all of the circulating flu strains were H1N1. Only severe cases of flu, which lead to hospitalization or death, were to be tested. The CDC adopted these recommendations for the United States, also. Despite the recommendation that deaths suspected to be from H1N1 be tested, the CDC is aware that many are not, and in many cases H1N1 might not have been suspected. The new CDC estimates are based on laboratory-confirmed cases, flu surveillance data and mathematical modeling, CDC spokesman Richard Quartarone told CNN. According to the report released Friday, the CDC estimates an average of 57 million people have been infected with H1N1 and an average 257,000 cases resulted in hospitalizations. Health officials continue to urge people who haven't received a vaccination to do so. ""The real tragedy is that people are still getting sick and we have a vaccine that will help prevent illness,"" Quartarone said.","CDC estimates between 8,330 and 17,160 people have died from H1N1 .

309,"Susan Craig's brother Roger died of a pulmonary embolism in 2007, at age 38. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder in high school, he had been on antipsychotic drugs for years. At the time of his death, he was carrying 280 pounds on his 6-foot-4-inch frame. Craig, a public relations specialist who works at Columbia University in New York City, knew that Roger's medications could cause weight gain. But she had never been told that the drugs he was taking might be harming his heart. ""We were never counseled by his psychiatrist or his primary care provider to watch for symptoms of heart disease or any risk of sudden death at all,"" Craig says. There's no evidence that Roger's medications caused his death, but his family might have been able to get him help sooner if they had known about the risks, Craig explains. New research published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that antipsychotic drugs are not risk free, and the study's authors are urging much more caution in their use. The drugs are associated with a risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly at higher doses. Health.com 10 best foods for your heart . Craig's brother was taking haloperidol, which belongs to an older class of drugs called typical antipsychotics, which have long been known to increase the risk of sudden death due to cardiac causes. He was also on risperidone, a member of a newer class of drugs called atypical antipsychotics, which had been considered safer. Doctors prescribe these newer medications, originally developed to treat schizophrenia, for a wide variety of problems -- from conduct disorder in kids to aggressive behavior in Alzheimer's patients. In fact, they've become so popular that three of them -- olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine -- are among the 10 top-selling drugs worldwide, with $14.5 billion in sales in 2007. The new study suggests that among patients taking high doses of atypical antipsychotics, there are about 3.3 cases of sudden cardiac death per 1,000 patients per year, which an editorial characterizes as a risk that's ""between 'moderate' and 'low,' but not 'rare.'"" Health.com: Heart drug may be a cancer fighter . About 325,000 people in the United States each year die of sudden cardiac death, which has an incidence of 0.1 to 0.2 percent per year in adults. ""[The drugs] have potentially very serious side effects,"" says Wayne A. Ray, Ph.D., the director of the division of pharmacoepidemiology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, in Nashville. ""So whenever a decision is made to use one, consideration of potential side effects needs to be made."" Ray and his colleagues found that atypical antipsychotics doubled the risk of sudden death from heart-related causes, most likely by causing disturbances in heart rhythms. First introduced in the mid-nineties, atypical antipsychotics were praised for having none of the troublesome side effects of their predecessors, including frequent, involuntary movements of the face and mouth that were in some cases irreversible. But the new study shows that the increased risk of sudden cardiac death seen with the older drugs is nearly identical to that of the newer medications. There had been suspicions that the drugs were risky, especially when used in older patients, but the current study is the first to systematically investigate their association with sudden cardiac death. Ray and his colleagues reviewed data on Tennessee Medicaid patients, comparing 44,218 people using older typical antipsychotics and 46,089 taking the newer atypical antipsychotics to 186,600 people who had never used the drugs. People with schizophrenia may have a higher rate of cardiac problems, due to smoking and other factors. To account for this, researchers also compared antipsychotic drug users without schizophrenia to non-drug users who had characteristics (in most cases, mood disorders) that made them likely candidates for the drugs. Overall, people taking typical antipsychotics were at 1.99-times greater risk of sudden cardiac death, while the risk for those on atypical antipsychotics was increased 2.26 times. The increased risk was greater for people on higher doses of the drugs. People who had used the drugs in the past but stopped weren't at greater risk of sudden cardiac death. ""The drugs are still very effective for conditions that there's proven evidence for,"" says Jeffrey A. Lieberman, M.D., a professor and chair of psychiatry at Columbia University, in New York City, and the director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, who was not involved with Ray's research. ""They clearly need to still be able to be used. I think this [study] really underscores the need to be very judicious about how these medications are used and whom they're given to."" While atypical antipsychotics have been used to ease aggressive behavior for patients with Alzheimer's disease, for example, they are not approved for this purpose by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; in fact, in 2005, the FDA issued a warning that these drugs increased the risk of death among elderly people, extending the warning to all antipsychotic drugs last year, notes Sebastian Schneeweiss, M.D., Sc.D., an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, in Boston, who coauthored an editorial accompanying the current study. Health.com: How is depression in the elderly different from dementia? Given the lack of better alternatives, these drugs are still widely used in patients with dementia despite the warnings, he adds. But while there's anecdotal evidence that they will ""cool these patients down"" and reduce their aggressive behaviors, there's no scientific evidence that they really help patients or their caregivers, Dr. Schneeweiss says. In his editorial, Dr. Schneeweiss and coauthor Jerry Avorn, M.D., also of Harvard, call for patients to undergo an electrocardiogram before and shortly after being placed on atypical antipsychotics, to determine if the drugs are causing any heart rhythm disturbances. For people who must be on these medications, Ray says, it's essential for their doctors to treat any other conditions, such as high blood pressure, that can harm the heart. ""Sudden cardiac death usually occurs when multiple risk factors are present,"" he explains. ""When you add one, it's kind of like the straw that broke the camel's back."" ""Absolutely the lowest dose that works should be used, because we found a strong dose response,"" Ray says. Jamaison Schuler, a spokesperson for Eli Lilly and Company, the maker of Zyprexa, says, ""Although the study appears to have important limitations, it provides additional information for practicing physicians to consider as they decide how to treat very complex diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."" The FDA has approved atypical antipsychotics for treating bipolar disorder, Ray adds. But the researcher recommends that physicians first try safer alternatives, such as the mood stabilizer lithium. ""That's a very serious illness, and it has important consequences for patients' quality of life and relationships,"" Ray notes. ""If the mood stabilizer doesn't work, I think it's very reasonable to consider an antipsychotic, but...other drugs should be considered first."" Finally, he says, a patient should never stop taking any drug without consulting his or her physician. Nevertheless, anyone taking an atypical antipsychotic for a non-FDA-approved use should consult his physician. ""I think off-label use should be undertaken very cautiously, and its frequency should be much less than it is currently,"" Ray says. Health.com: Superfoods that can save your health . For Susan Craig, the new research makes it clear that treating serious mental illness must go far beyond just prescribing pills. ""We need to be supporting these people in a better, more systematic way,"" she says. ""There's no magic pill. It's treating the whole person.""

310,"Washington (CNN) -- Eight weeks after an explosion uncorked a massive oil spill into the Gulf, BP still does not know whether its efforts to stanch the flow will soon succeed, its CEO will testify Thursday. ""We cannot guarantee the outcome of these operations, but we are working around the clock with the best experts from government and industry,"" Tony Hayward says in prepared testimony to be delivered before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Hayward expresses regret over the disaster. ""The explosion and fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon and the resulting oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico never should have happened -- and I am deeply sorry that they did,"" he says in his prepared remarks. ""None of us yet knows why it happened. But whatever the cause, we at BP will do what we can to make certain that an incident like this does not happen again."" Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, appeared underwhelmed at Hayward's planned appearance before his committee. CNNMoney.com: BP's Hayward to strike emotional tone . ""Look, he's a corporate guy,"" Stupak said. ""At the end of the day, he's going to put his best foot forward. It's not going to ring true with me or the American public. And we've got a mess on our hands, a disaster, a catastrophic disaster for our environment and those people who lost their lives. He's just going to say, 'I'm sorry, it's not going to happen again.' It's not good enough."" Stupak: Lawmakers going to take Hayward's 'hide off' But Hayward plans to say more than that. The drilling of two relief wells, ""which we believe represents the ultimate solution to stopping the flow of oil and gas from the well,"" has reached depths of 15,226 feet and 9,778 feet, respectively, he says, but they are not expected to be completed until August. ""We have spent nearly $1.5 billion so far, and we will not stop until the job is done,"" he says. Day 58: The latest on the oil disaster . Though the company has accepted that it is the ""responsible party,"" Hayward adds a qualification: ""It is important to understand that this 'responsible party' designation is distinct from an assessment of legal liability for the actions that led to the spill,"" he says. So far, more than 400,000 barrels of oily water mix have been recovered, and the company has paid more than $90 million on the more than 56,000 claims that have been submitted, he says. Additionally, about $16 million is expected to be paid this week to businesses, he says. In all, 32 walk-in claims offices are open in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi. Nearly 700 people have been assigned the task of handling claims, he says. How the oil-disaster flow estimates have evolved . Hayward adds that, though the cause of the disaster remains unclear, his company's investigation suggests that the accident was caused by the apparent failure of ""a number of processes, systems and equipment."" ""Investigations into the causes of the incident are ongoing, and issues of liability will be sorted out separately when the facts are clear and all the evidence is available."" The transcript of Hayward's planned remarks was given to reporters hours after he and other BP executives told President Obama that the company will set aside $20 billion in an escrow account to compensate oil spill victims. The fund ""will not supersede individuals' or states' rights to present claims in court,"" Obama said. BP, he asserted, will remain liable for the environmental disaster in the Gulf. BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said that the board of the oil giant has decided not to pay any further dividends this year. BP also has agreed to create a $100 million fund to compensate oil rig workers now unemployed as a result of closure of other deep-water rigs after the April 20 Deepwater Horizon explosion, Obama said. After taking a beating in recent weeks, BP's stock price closed Wednesday at 31.85, up 1.43 percent for the day. The Obama administration has tapped attorney Kenneth Feinberg to mediate the claims process. Feinberg played the same role in compensation for the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Anyone dissatisfied with Feinberg's handling of their claim will be able to appeal to a three-person panel, then to the federal oil spill liability trust fund and then to court, said Carol Browner, the president's point person on energy and climate change. BP has also paid roughly $70 million to the U.S. Coast Guard for cleanup operations, wire transfer receipts showed. Svanberg apologized to the American people for the disaster. He said he hoped the company could earn back the trust of the American people, because ""we care about the small people."" A few hours later, he issued a statement apologizing for the remark. ""I spoke clumsily this afternoon, and for that, I am very sorry,"" he said. ""What I was trying to say -- that BP understands how deeply this affects the lives of people who live along the Gulf and depend on it for their livelihood -- will best be conveyed not by any words but by the work we do to put things right for the families and businesses who've been hurt. Like President Obama, I believe we made some good progress toward that goal today."" BP has been under intense political pressure to ensure that it can cover all costs related to the catastrophic oil spill, the largest in U.S. history and one that Obama described as an ""unprecedented environmental disaster."" iReport: Share your views, solutions on Gulf oil spill . BP has been siphoning oil from a containment cap placed atop the ruptured well. The company said Wednesday that it has started collecting oil gushing into the Gulf through a second containment system attached to the ruptured well. The new system is connected directly to the blowout preventer and carries oil up to a second ship, the Q4000. By the end of July, officials hope to be able to contain as many as 80,000 barrels of oil per day, said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen. By that time, he predicted, there will be only ""minimal leakage"" around the wellhead. On Tuesday, government scientists increased their estimate of oil flowing into the Gulf by 50 percent -- to between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day. That translates into 1.5 million gallons to 2.5 million gallons per day. The government's previous estimate, issued last week, was 20,000 to 40,000 barrels per day. Obama said Wednesday that BP assured him that recovery efforts should capture up to 90 percent of the gushing oil in the coming days and weeks. ""That is still not good enough,"" Obama said. ""We will continue to press BP and draw on our best minds and resources to capture the rest of the oil until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that is expected to stop the leak completely."" The spill dwarfs the 11 million gallons that were dumped into Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989 when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground, and oil in varying amounts and consistencies has hit the shores of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.","BP CEO releases testimony to be read to Congress on Thursday .

311,"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Conson was downgraded from a typhoon early Saturday, a day after the deadly storm roared into China, along the southern tip of the island of Hainan. Conson is forecast to move through the Gulf of Tonkin on Saturday, making a final landfall in northern Vietnam, near Hanoi, in the afternoon, according to CNN World Weather. The storm, which killed at least 39 people during its westward march across the Philippines this week, had maximum sustained winds of 112 kph (70 mph) Saturday, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. At one point Friday morning, the storm's winds reached 139 kph (86 mph), making it the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane when it reached China. Southern China already had been battling severe flooding that killed 146 people over the past two weeks, destroyed about 113,000 homes and forced more than 1.2 million people to relocate this month, state media said Friday. Forty people were missing. According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, Chen Lei of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief office said the coming rain would exacerbate the flooding. Storms and floods have affected more than 35 million people in 10 China provinces this month. By Thursday, the nation had recorded at least 26 billion yuan (about $3.8 billion) in economic losses, Xinhua said. Conson had weakened from a typhoon to a tropical storm before its landfall late Tuesday in the Philippines, but that didn't keep the storm from wreaking havoc as it traversed the archipelago off the Asian mainland. Conson then traveled across the South China Sea, picking up strength. Along with the rising death toll, the Philippines' National Disaster Coordinating Council said Friday that 84 people were missing.

312,"(CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor will undergo hip replacement surgery Monday after she broke her hip when falling out of bed, her publicist said Sunday. Gabor, 93, will need the surgery on her right hip, publicist John Blanchette said. The operation is scheduled for 6 a.m. Monday (9 a.m. ET) and should last about four hours, he said. A press conference is scheduled at Gabor's Los Angeles, California, home at noon Monday, he said. Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, told CNN earlier Sunday, ""She has a broken hip and they have to operate on her. It's a complicated thing. It was an accident. And she is not that young any more."" Von Anhalt said Gabor fell out of bed Saturday night when she reached to answer the phone. An ambulance rushed her to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, after he called 911. He said she was on medication and asleep early Sunday morning. ""Her family is by her side. No other information is available from the hospital per the family's request,"" hospital spokeswoman Roxanne Yamaguchi Moster said in a statement. Blanchette said earlier Gabor was watching ""Jeopardy!"" when she fell out of bed. ""She has an active mind. She's very bright. She's funny. She always makes me laugh whenever I talk to her,"" Blanchette said. ""Her body's failing her."" Blanchette said Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident. The crash occurred when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Her husband has been caring for her, Blanchette said. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her eight marriages. Among her husbands were hotel millionaire Conrad Hilton and Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge;"" ""The Story of Three Loves,"" 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin,"" 1957; and Orson Welles' classic ""Touch of Evil,"" 1958. In 1989, Gabor was sentenced to 72 hours in jail for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer after a traffic stop. She also had to perform community service at a battered women's shelter. The other Gabor sisters were Magda, the oldest, who died in 1997 five days shy of 83, and Eva, the youngest, who died in 1995 at 76. Magda, an occasional stage actress, also was married to George Sanders at one time. Eva is probably best remembered for her role as a socialite turned farmer's wife on the 1960s' TV sitcom ""Green Acres.""

313,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Even though Hurricane Alex was headed away from the site of the massive BP oil spill Wednesday, it was affecting containment and collection efforts on multiple fronts, Coast Guard officials said. Alex, upgraded from a tropical storm late Tuesday, was causing heavy seas throughout the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday. That had several major consequences: Oil skimming ships had to return to shore, containment booms were thrown asunder and efforts to burn oil on the surface and break it down through dispersants were put on hold, along with efforts to position a third ship to collect oil at the spill site. ""Until the weather subsides, all we can do is have everything ready to attack and remove this oil once we have weather  that's more conducive,"" said Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft, who delivered a briefing for the Coast Guard on Wednesday. ""We've been held hostage for the last two days due to the prevailing weather,"" he said. Alex -- the first hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season --  was picking up speed and coming ashore in an unpopulated area of northeastern Mexico, some 100 miles south of the Texas border. It is a Category 2 storm with sustained winds of 100 mph. But even though the center of the storm is more than 600 miles from the spill site, it is producing high seas where the oil is located, according to CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers. Winds are 15 to 20 mph at the spill site, producing waves 6 to 8 feet high, he said. That poses a problem for the skimmers,Zukunft said. ""When seas get over 3 feet high, the skimmers become ineffective. They wind up gathering water and not oil,"" he said. More than 500 skimmers, from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, have been forced to return to shore. Also on hold: setting up another ship to contain oil at the spill site. BP has two vessels, the Discoverer Enterprise and the Q4000, that are being used to contain oil. The company had hoped to bring in a third Tuesday called the Helix Producer, which would increase total containment capability to 53,000 barrels of oil per day. But crews need seas of less than 4 feet to make a connection to a coupler below the surface, according to Zukunft. BP now is aiming to complete the job by July 7, he said. The Coast Guard official said the seas also have disrupted containment booms, meant to limit the amount of oil reaching shore. He said officials will be making an aerial survey of the situation Thursday. One thing that has not been affected -- BP's effort to drill relief wells down to the area where oil is leaking. Weather would have to be very severe to affect that, according to Zukunft, and at this point, BP said it is on track to reach the area in August. The storm also is having an impact on where the massive oil spill is flowing. Previously, some oil had been reaching Pensacola Beach in Florida, but the storm's prevailing southeast winds have drawn it more toward the environmentally sensitive Mississippi and Chandeleur sounds, off the coast of Mississippi and Louisiana, Zukunft said. Myers said that's because the storm winds are moving counterclockwise in a huge arc. The strong winds are expected to blow for about three days, pushing the oil back to shore in the area where there already have been dramatic pictures of oil-drenched birds. The Coast Guard briefing came on a day of change for the service branch, as Adm. Thad Allen, who has been overseeing the cleanup effort for the government, officially retired from the Coast Guard. Allen will continue as the national incident commander for the spill, but as a civilian. The move was announced by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who said in a statement, ""I commend Adm. Allen for nearly 40 years of dedicated military service in the Coast Guard. Throughout his career, our nation has turned to Thad Allen for leadership at times of great crisis, and this is one of those times."" She continued, ""Thad Allen has provided excellent leadership as the national commander of our massive response to the largest environmental disaster in our nation's history, and he will continue to leverage his decades of experience in civilian duty as the national incident commander for this spill."" Adm. Robert Papp was sworn in as Coast Guard commandant on May 24, when Allen left the Coast Guard's top post as previously planned, to serve solely as national incident commander on the Gulf spill. Meanwhile, authorities also were busy preparing for future storms. Planners with the Louisiana governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness this week created a hurricane evacuation plan with BP, said the office's director, Mark Cooper. The plan, applicable for the entire hurricane season -- which ends November 30 -- calls for BP's thousands of workers to leave the Louisiana coast at least 16 hours before officials begin evacuating residents. ""We can't have BP blocking our roadways with equipment and personnel,"" said Cooper. It also designates 700 buses to be used only by disabled residents and calls for BP to be back on the scene combating the spill within 72 hours after a hurricane, said Cooper. Researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels (about 1.5 million gallons) and 60,000 barrels (about 2.5 million gallons) of oil are gushing into the gulf every day.

314,"(CNN) -- Some passengers on a diverted Aeromexico flight finally reached their destination in Seattle, Washington, on Wednesday after spending 16 hours in limbo. The plane was scheduled to fly from Mexico City, Mexico, to Seattle on Tuesday, but was diverted to Portland, Oregon, because of thick fog, said Kara Simonds, a spokeswoman for Portland International Airport. In Portland, the passengers were not allowed to exit the plane for four hours because the airport did not have enough customs agents to process them, according to CNN affiliate KING. KING also reported several passengers became so angry that police boarded the plane and told them to stay there or be arrested. Fire officials tried to calm down the outraged passengers by providing them with burgers from a local fast-food restaurant during their wait, Simonds said. Passengers were then flown back to Mexico City after officials could not solve the issue with customs agents, Simonds said. Seattle residents Mike and Karin Kuntz said they had a good vacation in Mexico, but it went downhill after they tried to get home. ""We had a wonderful time, everything went great. Then the flight home turned into a nightmare,"" Karin Kuntz told KING. ""We just felt like we were hostages -- that we, as passengers, had no rights."" Karin Kuntz said she was concerned about the pilot's fatigue and the safety. ""Can he fly back? Is he logged in? How many hours does he have,"" she said. ""No one seemed to be concerned about putting us back on that plane for all that time and that poor tired pilot."" The couple said they waited in the airport in Mexico City for 10 hours before getting a flight back to Seattle on Wednesday night. It is unclear whether other passengers on the flight were able to get to their destination. Representatives from Aeromexico said they were investigating the situation and issued a statement apologizing for the inconvenience. ""We will seek an explanation about why the customs agents were not available to assist the plane and its passengers in Portland,"" the statement said. ""We will also take appropriate steps to thank the passengers who were inconvenienced by this situation for their patience."" However, the ordeal did not end for the Kuntzes when they reached Seattle. ""They lost one of our bags,"" Mike Kuntz said. It is unclear if other passengers on the flight were able to get to their destination. Representatives from Aeromexico said they were investigating the situation and planned to release a statement.

315,"(CNN) -- When our helicopter flew into Port-au-Prince, it almost felt like we were on some silent glide. The sharp sound of the rotor blades faded into background noise. Sound did not rise from the ground. There was not enough traffic or people or life to raise a ruckus. There were no fires burning or that dark energy that rises up from the ground when there is danger in the air. There was silence, people huddling in tents alongside flattened buildings, people sifting slowly through the rubble of their lives, people adrift. We entered Haiti like a lot of the folks entering Haiti, down right nervous. Haiti has a history of horrible acts of violence against its own people and visitors. Journalists have died in Haiti. There are many guns and many vendettas. It's not just that there is an earthquake whose aftershocks could rattle away at what remains. There is an expectation of danger, a question in the air. Will these desperate, disheartened, wounded people rise to violence and theft in the wake of this latest, largest disaster? We landed without incident in the yard of the Dominican Embassy with precious supplies brought in by relief organizations. A CNN convoy laden with water and money and fuel followed us in by land without a hitch. And in the days that followed, we did not see a population breaking into buildings or fighting over scant resources. The Haiti we saw is not a land of fires and violence and looting. This is a land where desperation has been supplanted by despair. Each day, we left our workspace with security people, drivers, big guys that were supposed to help us navigate presumed dangers. They mostly hung out and chatted with kids playing around our cars. They walked us into a huge plaza where a massive tent city had formed. It was so quiet. People just sitting there, holding their children beneath sheets so they aren't burned in the sun. Some mothers are bathing their kids in murky water. There is one remedial medical station beneath a tent. Three medical volunteers with meager supplies tend to the wounds of dozens. Anguished mothers wait patiently with children wounded and wailing. No one complains. No one pushes. One afternoon we happened upon Capital Bank, a building that also housed a Western Union and some local money order services. A flotilla of United Nations folks from Ghana and France and Canada descended with major artillery. A tank, a string of armored cars and high-ranking officials with bright stripes decorating their uniforms rushed around on high alert. They shut down the street as they entered the building and brought out sacks that seemed to be filled with money. Full coverage . When we went to take a picture, they became very agitated. Some of them yelled that we had no business here and pushed us back into the road where the oncoming cars fortunately stopped in time. They were so overwhelming that a female official from Ghana began to laugh at her colleagues. ""Let them take the photo,"" she told a muscular Canadian officer. ""Here,"" he said handing her his walkie talkie. ""You be in charge of this mission."" But the ""mission"" was barely picture worthy. The Haitians ambled by, as the apparent sacks of money were removed for safe keeping. The scene was the same at the building where taxes are collected. A great crane lifted rubble while a crowd watched peacefully. No one seemed to be trying to get into the flattened presidential palace nearby even though there was not much visible security. We also passed gas lines. Gas is the key to so many things right now, powering the car that can get you out of this disaster, running the generator that can turn on your lights or make it possible to call for help on a cell phone. The cars sit quietly, drivers holding their places without a quarrel. We drove around day after day and saw nothing but sad people sweeping their streets of rubble and bodies and wreckage. We drove out to Leogan, the epicenter of the quake, and people calmly moved bananas, sugar cane and water from the fields into tent cities erected in open space. Haiti's missing, found . We saw an organized crowd being handed water bottles from soldiers who flew in from Camp Lejeune. We did not see one gun, except the ones carried by security guards, police officers and soldiers. In Jacmel, two hours south, a group of young Haitians ran around with expensive video cameras documenting the destruction of their hometown, Haiti's cultural capital. They had water flown in by their sponsors as well as food and generators, but no one tried to steal them. The hotels that survived were unguarded but not a soul ventured in to take the furniture or bedding that might have made life in the tent cities more bearable. Haitian doctors staffed the ""hospital,"" a patch of grass outside the real hospital that fell down. Cuban doctors helped them with their work, rationing antibiotics and painkillers. People were in great pain, but no one screamed for help or painkillers. They seemed to think that they were getting whatever was available. The Canadians posted guards at one gate to keep folks from getting to the piers where they brought in supplies, but no one was trying to get in anywhere around this huge dock. They stood in line at distribution centers, grabbed a broom or shovel to help the soldiers clear streets. When the French erected a mobile medical unit, the people formed a peaceful line and repeatedly expressed their gratitude. These are people with injuries that make you gasp. Many amputations have been done by amateurs in bad circumstances. It's hot. No one said a word. We followed the directors of an orphanage as they traveled through some of Port-au-Prince's poorest neighborhoods. They didn't have many supplies, but they wanted to share. No one tried to rob us. A woman broke down in tears begging us to help us find her son. She ignored our bottles of water and food. She just wanted her son. Impact Your World . A few nights later, her orphanage was hit by bandits who didn't take anything, but scared the kids. At another orphanage we visited, bandits struck twice but left both times with nothing. The orphanage director said they left it because they didn't want to steal supplies from children. My colleagues saw a few folks break into places and even captured a few scuffles on tape. But those who have spent a lot of time in Haiti was certain there was no more crime, possibly even less crime, than would visit this city of millions on a regular day. The story of Haiti, at this time, is not one of unending violence, looting and a population angry enough to fight over scant resources. But the people we met were wounded and weary and afraid to go back inside.

316,"(CNN) -- Communities in northeastern Mexico found themselves flooded and isolated Tuesday as Mexico's National Water Commission tried to manage high levels at area reservoirs due to Hurricane Alex. Servando Lopez Moreno, mayor of Miguel Aleman, Mexico, said that the water commission released water from the nearby El Cuchillo reservoir without warning communities near the river, which flooded homes and crops, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Miguel Aleman is located in the state of Tamaulipas, near the border with Texas. The mayor said his town was not affected directly by Hurricane Alex, but by the lack of coordination between reservoir managers and local officials. He said that the communities of San Antonio de Reyna, Mexico, and Arcabuz, Mexico, faced flooded homes, ruined sorghum crops and disabled work equipment as well as lack of electricity and phone lines, Notimex reported. There were no fatalities in the flooding, the mayor said. He asked for federal and state authorities to intervene to avoid future problems. In the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon, the effects of Alex were more direct. Some 40,000 Nuevo Leon residents were pushed out of their homes because of the storm, authorities said. The state's ministry of health announced an emergency program that includes psychological attention to those affected, Notimex reported. The head of the health department, Jesus Zacarias Villarreal, said the psychological services were for those people with anxiety, nervousness and depression as a result of the storm. Alex stormed onshore as a Category 2 Hurricane on June 30, causing at least six deaths in Nuevo Leon.","River rose because of water released from reservoir .

317,"(CNN) -- The oil spill on the Gulf Coast has states and visitors bureaus working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . The beaches in Fort Walton Beach, Destin and Okaloosa Island are open to the public and the air quality is good, according to the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, which represents the three destinations. ""Depending on the wind direction, tar balls may float ashore in Destin or Ft. Walton Beach later in the week, but cleaning crews are standing by,"" the bureau's website said. Small to moderate-size tar balls continue to wash up on some beaches of south Walton County, but the impact has been isolated and all 15 beach communities remain open, according to the Walton County Tourist Development Council's website. Meanwhile, small scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach, but the beaches are open and the swimming is still safe, the area's visitors bureau website said. ""Our sugary white sand beaches are open for the enjoyment of our guests and, as of now, we are seeing only intermittent impact,"" according to the bureau. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . The beaches of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key are open for swimming, but sporadic tar balls and a milky sheen have been reported on Perdido Key, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""Skimmer vessels respond to reports of oil sightings as needed. In addition, clean-up crews will be working on beaches at night when temperatures are cooler,"" the bureau's website said. iReport: A slick trip to Perdido Key . Last week, the Escambia County Health Department rescinded a health advisory that had been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama border to the entrance of the Perdido Unit of the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Government officials said that there was no oil sheen or oil slick observed in the water from the high-water mark out to 100 yards from shore. Dime-size to 5-inch tar balls continue to wash up in widely scattered areas of northwest Florida, but all of the state's beaches remain open, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. But several spots have been affected by the oil spill. On Santa Rosa Island, a clean-up was under way where light mousse -- a frothy oil-water mixture -- made landfall. Significant tar balls washed ashore near Opal Beach and oil sheen was approaching Opal's shoreline. ""Response efforts include the constant surveillance for oil on the water,"" the website said. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama, have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""The beaches are open and visitors are still welcome to sunbathe and walk the beach, but we strongly suggest they swim in a pool or enjoy our many off-beach activities,"" the site said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Grand Isle, Louisiana . The oil's biggest impact in Louisiana is on the portion of the coast from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east, according to a state emergency website. ""Most of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, 70 percent, is unaffected by the oil spill and remains open for commercial and recreational fishing,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website.

318,"(CNN) -- As oil began approaching the coast of the United States, environmental scientists said the effects of the spill in the Gulf of Mexico could have ecological and biological consequences for years, if not decades. The intricate ecosystem is a major source of seafood for the United States and hundreds of species of animals and plants are at risk, experts said. Some areas in the path of the slick are particularly sensitive to problems because unlike the rocky coast of Alaska hit by oil from the Exxon Valdez disaster, much of the coastline that will be hit by the BP spill consists of marshy areas where the water is calmer and more difficult to clean. The marshes are in extreme danger, said a biologist with the University of Houston who studies coastal wetlands. ""It's likely going to persist for decades because it will get into the marsh where there is very little wave action and the soil is oxygen poor,"" said Steve Pennings. ""The immediate acute impact might not be that severe because there is not much oil getting to a certain spot, but because the oil might stick around [in the sediment] for 20 years you might have a real chronic effect."" The oil spill started April 20 after an explosion on the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven oil-rig workers remain missing and are presumed dead. The rig sank April 22 about 50 miles off the southeast coast of Louisiana and the untapped wellhead is gushing oil into the Gulf. About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said. Wetlands in Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states were already struggling because of sea-level rise and the lack of sediment due to some rivers being channelized, Pennings said. Mike Beck, senior scientist on the global marine team for the Nature Conservancy, said there is a lot of concern for oyster reefs, which were also already suffering. Only 15 percent of the world's oyster reefs remain because of over-harvesting and dredging, he said, and hurricanes have also destroyed some reefs. He said there have been some oil spills in Europe that provide clues as to what might happen. ""What we have learned from other accidents is we've seen mortality and then we have seen lower growth rate,"" he said, ""so that even if they're not killed, you are likely to have much lower [population] growth. We're not likely to be able to eat those oysters for quite some time because ... they hold heavy metals in their tissue."" He estimated that the damage to the reefs could last two to five years, but that other oil spills have shown that in some instances it can be longer than that. Beck pointed out that 40 percent of the U.S. seafood supply comes from the northern Gulf of Mexico and 95 percent of the species in the seafood harvest are dependent on the health of the nation's estuaries and marshes. Environmentalist Richard Charter of the Defenders of Wildlife organization said the size of the oil spill will be overwhelming to cleanup crews. ""This event is a self-feeding fire,"" Charter said. ""It is so big and expanding so fast that it's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective. ... You're looking at a long-term poisoning of the area. Ultimately, this will have a multidecade impact."" Some officials worried the destruction could surpass the Exxon Valdez disaster of 20 years ago. That oil tanker ran aground on the Bligh Reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989 and spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil. The surface oil from the Exxon Valdez spill had largely disappeared within three years of the spill, according to studies conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Response and Restoration. The 1997 report said that what oil did remain could be found on beaches that were near still water. The residual oil was not nearly as toxic as the oil studied in the days after the spill. The report said ""intertidal species can tolerate its presence even though it can accumulate in their tissues."" However, a 2003 study published in the journal Science disputed the NOAA finding of toxicity and said that oil in the sediment was still harming the species more than a decade after the accident. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustees Council also disagreed. A spokeswoman told the Anchorage Daily News last year that oil in some parts of the sound is still toxic. All the scientists CNN spoke to said that the long-term impacts of the spill depend on how much oil reaches the coast. The choppy seas are hindering containment efforts, experts said. ""The question is -- we rarely clean up more than 15 or 20 percent of a spill on a calm day, and we aren't seeing a calm day,"" Charter said. The impact will also depend on what states are hit. Beck said there are two major loop currents and one runs along the Louisiana wetlands past Mississippi and Alabama then down the coast of Florida and around the Keys. ""Eventually that water moves out into the Caribbean and the Atlantic,"" he said, indicating the East Coast needs to pay attention to where the oil is traveling.","Oil might remain in the sediment of a marsh for 20 years .

319,"(CNN) -- The West Virginia coal mine where 29 miners died in an explosion in April had a sudden and large inundation of methane gas the day of the accident, the mine owner said Thursday. The level of methane -- an explosive gas -- was almost three times greater than normal, Massey Energy Company said. It is still too early to determine what caused the April 5 explosion, but the methane gas data is a ""very important piece of evidence"" in the ongoing investigation, said Christopher Schemel, a leading explosions expert and a member of the investigation team. Investigators tested data from the mine's primary ventilation exhaust fan and found the unexpected release of gas was intense and overwhelmed the normal safety systems, the company said. ""To put it in perspective, a methane release of this size would completely fill a 2,000 square-foot house with an explosive atmosphere in under 40 seconds, and could fill the volume of a typical mine entry to explosive levels in under 25 seconds,"" Schemel said. The explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in Naoma, about 30 miles south of Charleston, was the industry's worst disaster in 40 years. The investigation since then has focused on the mine's poor safety record and Massey's response to problems in the past. A preliminary report on the disaster by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration found that the Upper Big Branch mine had ""a significant history of safety issues"" and that the agency was closely monitoring Massey Energy. In 2009, federal inspectors issued 515 citations and orders at the Upper Big Branch mine, with 39 percent of them for ""significant and substantial"" violations. More than 50 of the citations were for problems that the operators knew about but had not corrected, according to federal mine safety records. Thirty-one men were working in the mine when the explosion happened on a Monday afternoon. Most of the blast victims were working in an area where long wall cutting was taking place. The technique uses a large grinder to extract the coal and creates large amounts of coal dust and methane gas, both of which are explosive. Recovery crews found some of the bodies in a section of the mine where readings showed high levels of gases, and the crews needed breathing gear to enter, said Jama Jarrett, spokeswoman for the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training. Rescuers had to use high-pressure fans to pull the toxic air through holes to the surface. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","NEW: The explosion was the mining industry's worst disaster in 40 years .

320,"(CNN) -- As temperatures climbed toward the 90s across the Washington metro region Monday, hundreds of thousands of people were left to cope with the blistering heat as utility crews worked to restore power after a violent thunderstorm that killed two people. A 6-year-old boy was fatally injured while walking with his family Sunday afternoon in Sterling, Virginia, when heavy wind caused a large section of a tree to fall, according to Kraig Troxell, a spokesman for the Loudoun County sheriff. The boy, whose name was not released, died at a Virginia hospital, Troxell said. A second person was killed and another was injured in Beltsville, Maryland, on Sunday when a tree fell on the car in which they were riding, according to Cpl. Clinton Copeland, a spokesman for the Prince George's County Police Department. Meanwhile, utility crews restored power to a Washington-area nursing home that has been forced to brave the elements since Sunday afternoon. Cooling buses and emergency crews worked with building nurses and officials until power was restored about 1 p.m Monday, according to Pete Piringer, a spokesman for the District of Columbia Fire and EMS. As a precautionary measure, five people were transported to area hospitals with heat-related illness. Their conditions were not severe, Piringer added. Electricity provider Pepco said Monday that about 220,000 residences across the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia were still in the dark -- and without air-conditioning -- following one of the hottest days of the year. July's brutal onslaught of record heat continued in the eastern United States, with temperature records set Sunday in Baltimore, Maryland, where it hit 100 degrees, and Washington, where it was 98. By Monday afternoon, damage had been reported across the region from 270 downed trees or very large limbs, including approximately 20 full large trees, according to the District Department of Transportation. More than 20 traffic signals remained out because of power problems, the department added. The storm was part of a slow-moving front that struck parts of the Northeast before moving south. Heat advisories and warnings continue for the Deep South in parts of Georgia and South Carolina through Monday; the heat index is expected to exceed 105 degrees.

321,"LONDON, England -- A severe rabies epidemic has claimed the lives of at least 83 children within three months in Angola's capital, Luanda, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. Luanda, which has a large population of stray dogs, also has some of the world's worst slums. Describing the situation as ""very worrying,""  WHO rabies expert Francois Meslin told CNN: ""This is a huge number and could be the tip of the iceberg."" A doctor working at the country's biggest referral hospital Hospital Pediatrico David Bernardino said staff were unable to save any of the children as rabies vaccines had run out. Some of the children were also brought into the hospital too late to be saved, Luis Bernardino, head of the hospital told UN humanitarian organization IRIN. He warned that the number of deaths could be much higher. ""The children were brought to our hospital and are the only ones we know of, so the number could be higher,"" Bernardino told IRIN. ""It is a sad moment for us,"" he added. ""I think it was probably that no one was prepared for such a high case load."" The number of cases has now started declining, however, said Bernardino. According to Meslin, this could be because the current infected pack of dogs has died. Meslin told CNN that the Angolan government needed to embark on a dog rabies control program urgently to prevent further outbreaks. Angola's capital, where most of the population live in slums, has a large number of stray dogs who are said to have caused the epidemic. ""We have had some sporadic cases in other provincial capitals in the country; we think the virus was brought into Luanda and then spread through the dogs -- Angolans love dogs,"" Bernardino said. ""When the first 10 deaths were reported in December 2008 we alerted the authorities, but we do not have veterinary services in the city, no kennels [to keep and observe the animals] and vaccinate them,"" he added. Another problem contributing to the crisis is that vaccines are too expensive for the average family. ""One dose of vaccine costs about $10 and five of those have to be administered, which makes the total cost of treatment $50 which is more than a month's salary for families in most developing countries,"" Meslin added. In 2008 the WHO wrote that rabies, a disease transmitted from animals with infected saliva to humans, is present on nearly every continent of the world but more that 95 per cent of human deaths occur in Asia and Africa. It can be prevented by vaccination, either prior to exposure or as part of post-exposure treatment. But once symptoms of the disease develop, rabies is fatal. According to the WHO, rabies can affect the lungs, stomach and central nervous systems. In the critical stage, a victim slips into a coma and death, usually due to breathing failure. More than 55,000 people die of rabies each year, the WHO wrote, with 30 to 60 per cent of the victims of dog bites being children under the age of 15.","A severe rabies epidemic has killed at least 83 children in 3 months in Angola .
Francois Meslin, rabies expert at the WHO says this is cause for serious concern .
Once symptoms develop, rabies is always fatal, according to the WHO .",297 546 1 1479 32785 6256 20 395 0 400 5 12 296 5899 217 390 95 193 4 18877 7 763 51407 0 115 422 1391 25 20 21 51407 38 20 1 487 1390 5 9754 2503 41 20 76 5 0 115 7 1204 17386 2761 0 662 16 107 4395 25 32785 1647 6945 156090 67 122 24 10 1 573 219 3 72 22 0 3681 5 0 13150 1 1327 277 12 0 177 7 777 14402 388 388 295231 382 22430 21 536 37 916 2 1036 100 5 0 217 16 32785 13093 32 383 40 76 5 0 217 37 41 541 54 0 388 194 416 2 22 1967 3507 22430 254 5 0 388 67 4600 3901 1391 123317 27 833 11 0 219 5 1438 72 22 133 1127 0 217 37 541 2 110 388 3 28 0 80 1274 43 143 5 59 0 219 72 22 1127 22430 67 123317 13 10 1 1885 550 6 152 27 141 46 150 13 14 769 11 61 35 14 1412 6 132 1 220 229 6304 0 219 5 806 20 70 287 7476 185 21 22430 120 2 156090 24 72 22 82 0 673 4627 3608 5 2503 20 304 156090 67 122 11 0 36956 228 613 2 11308 8 1 1619 32785 502 1090 8086 2 1151 370 10645 18877 7 763 81 96 5 0 1390 369 4 17386 20 1 487 219 5 9754 2503 25 28 21 2 19 592 0 6256 43 19 32 76 14667 806 4 66 7912 16707 4 0 177 43 150 0 4293 14 541 54 51407 3 92 1432 112 0 2503 123337 404 2503 22430 21 36 0 69 166 1438 37 258 4 512 728 43 4067 0 401 18 43 89 26 19 10276 713 4 0 210 61 25579 2 311 3 7524 0 1768 3 30052 73 27 141 119 589 6124 2 0 1253 10 11 13093 28 194 1691 6 0 1057 137 35 7000 5 9582 1146 44 166 3 191 5 118 19 2 22 7461 38 563 0 800 738 5 791 464 38 10 45 60 1 201 7 4318 6 758 4 96 2193 752 156090 141 4 728 0 25 444 11 32785 1 1368 8577 17 1768 9 4627 16737 2 3036 10 1183 8 471 195 4799 5 0 115 18 45 11 4001 338 542 5 630 1438 3578 4 2775 3 1255 13 57 22 3813 15 15041 754 1875 2 4119 50 16 144 5 111886 791 18 267 2755 5 0 1368 1884 32785 10 2368 120 2 0 25 32785 57 2270 0 6397 3179 3 770 3339 2034 4 0 1548 879 1 783 13826 54 1 6380 3 264 1168 381 2 3369 1677 45 60 1914 125 62 1428 5 32785 236 79 0 25 444 9 286 2 904 338 542 5 0 834 5 1619 9738 74 217 140 0 537 5 292,5d43312e1d387d73584254d38c0dea01136a9ddd,
322,"(CNN) -- The oil spill on the Gulf Coast has states and visitors bureaus working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . Oil has affected sections of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key beaches, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Photos from the area showed patches of dark, syruplike oil on the white sand, but local officials said the situation is getting better. ""Our beaches continue to improve hourly as the crews clean up,"" said Ed Schroeder, director of Visit Pensacola, in a statement on the bureau's website. On Thursday, yellow tape blocked about a quarter mile of the beach to public access, CNN affiliate WPMI-TV reported. Local officials said the temporary closure was put in place to speed up the cleanup process. Pensacola Beach is open, but the waters from the Park West recreation area to the area just west of Portofino are closed to all swimming and wading until further notice because of large quantities of emulsified oil in shore waters and along the shoreline, the visitors bureau said. ""The shoreline and water along Santa Rosa Sound on the north side of the island is still clean, clear and open for swimming,"" according to the bureau's website. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . A no-swimming notice has been issued for Destin Beach because of the presence of ""tar chips,"" according to the website of the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, which represents the destination. There were no reported oil impacts along beaches of south Walton County on Friday morning, the area's Tourist Development Council said on its website. The health advisory issued this week for a stretch of beach in the western end of the county has been lifted after two consecutive, clean high-tide cycles, the council said. Meanwhile, small scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach, but the beaches are open and the swimming is still safe, the area's visitors bureau website said. ""Our sugary white sand beaches are open for the enjoyment of our guests and, as of now, we are seeing only intermittent impact,"" according to the bureau. iReport: A slick trip to Perdido Key . Tar balls, tar patties and tar mousse -- a puddinglike oil-water mixture -- continue to be found in northwest Florida, with the heaviest impacts reported between Escambia and Walton counties, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. All of the state's beaches remain open. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. But several spots have been affected by the oil spill. A health advisory is in effect from Walkover 23 on Pensacola Beach, Florida, to the west tip of Santa Rosa Island including Fort Pickens. This advisory extends to the Perdido Key area, including Johnson Beach. ""Because of significant quantities of oil in the water and coming ashore signage and flags advise visitors to not wade or swim in the water,"" according to the park. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""The beaches are open and visitors are still welcome to sunbathe and walk the beach, but we strongly suggest they swim in a pool or enjoy our many off-beach activities,"" the site said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan, and in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Grand Isle, Louisiana . The oil's biggest impact in Louisiana is on the portion of the coast from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east, according to a state emergency website. ""Most of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, 70 percent, is unaffected by the oil spill and remains open for commercial and recreational fishing,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website. Grand Isle has closed its public beach, the site said.","NEW: A no-swimming notice has been issued for Destin Beach, Florida .

323,"(CNN) -- The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has coastal states and visitors bureaus working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . Oil has affected sections of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key beaches, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Photos from the area showed patches of dark, syruplike oil on the white sand, but local officials said cleanup crews are ready to respond to the oil. Beaches on Perdido Key and Santa Rosa Island are open for swimming, according to the bureau's website. ""We are all heartbroken and concerned about recent impacts from the Deepwater Horizon incident but rest assured the situation on our beaches remains dynamic,"" said Ed Schroeder, director of Visit Pensacola, in a statement on the bureau's website. A health advisory for parts of Pensacola Beach has been withdrawn, according to the Escambia County Health Department. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . The Okaloosa County Health Department has withdrawn a health advisory issued last week for Destin beaches. ""The oil impacts on our beaches are intermittent and can change within hours or within a day due to the dynamic nature of the currents and changing wind directions,"" the department's website said. The department does urge visitors to avoid entering the water when oil is present. The beaches of south Walton County are open, according to a weekend update on the website for the area's Tourist Development Council . Small tar balls have been reported on several area beaches, the site said. Meanwhile, small scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach, but the beaches and water are open, the area's visitors bureau website said. iReport: A slick trip to Perdido Key . Tar balls, tar patties and tar mousse -- a puddinglike oil-water mixture -- continue to be found in northwest Florida between Escambia and Walton counties, with the heaviest effects reported in Escambia County, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. But several spots have been affected by the oil spill, and a public health advisory is in effect parkwide. ""If you see or smell oil in the water or on the beach, avoid contact with water and report it to the nearest lifeguard or park ranger,"" the park service's website said. Coastal Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""The beaches are open and visitors are still welcome to sunbathe and walk the beach, but we strongly suggest they swim in a pool or enjoy our many off-beach activities,"" the site said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan, and in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Last week, the department also issued a no-swimming advisory for Dauphin Island and the Mississippi Sound. Grand Isle, Louisiana . The oil's biggest impact in Louisiana is on the portion of the coast from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east, according to a state emergency website. ""Most of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, 70 percent, is unaffected by the oil spill and remains open for commercial and recreational fishing,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website. Grand Isle has closed its public beach, the site said.","No-swimming notice withdrawn for Destin, Florida, beaches .

324,"(CNN) -- Monday, the official first day of winter, airlines were scrambling to accommodate passengers affected by the cancellation of hundreds of flights after a monster weekend winter storm blanketed a swath of the East Coast. Charlene Fisk, a filmmaker from Atlanta, Georgia, tried her best not to lose it at Hartsfield International Airport on Monday at 4:30 a.m. when she found out she wouldn't be getting home to upstate New York anytime soon. Her US Airways connecting flight had been canceled, so she was placed on another flight to Philadelphia, which was then canceled. She's going to have to fly to Chicago on Monday evening, hopefully stay the night with friends and then hop on a standby flight to Syracuse. Her family will have to drive about an hour from their home to pick her up. ""Passengers are talking about renting cars together and just driving home,"" Fisk said. US Airways is picking up the tab to fly Fisk to Chicago. And while some airlines are offering refunds, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines said the company is providing weather waivers that allow passengers to reschedule without a penalty if they were scheduled to travel before Christmas. Another strong winter system will be developing by Tuesday in the Rockies. The system will take a track through the central Plains, Midwest, and into the western Great Lakes. Winter storm and blizzard watches are already in effect for the Central Plains for Tuesday night through Thursday. Severe weather also will be possible from Dallas and Houston, Texas, to Little Rock, Arkansas, and New Orleans, Louisiana. On Monday, CNN correspondent Susan Candiotti was taking her first day of vacation when she began a chaotic journey from Newark, New Jersey. Already with boarding pass in hand, she spent nearly two hours in three different lines because agents were unsure which line passengers should be in, she said. Another agent eventually told Candiotti and others to go directly to TSA security where they got in another line. A different Continental agent then lead them to an upper floor to check their bags. Then, they were sent back to security and she made it to her  8:45 a.m. flight gate with 10 minutes to spare only to learn that the flight had been postponed until around 11 a.m., when it eventually took off for Columbus, Ohio. Her final destination is northern Kentucky which she'll eventually reach once her sister picks her up in Ohio and drives her home. ""My experience today was nothing compared to many people we interviewed (on Sunday) who stood in line for three or four hours,"" Candiotti said. ""One student trying to get to Denver had to spend two sleepless nights at the airport. So, my delay pales by comparison."" Washington's Dulles and Reagan National airports saw snowfall of 18 inches and 16.4 inches respectively on Sunday, the highest one-day totals ever for December. Alison Young posted on her Facebook page that she's glad her brother finally made it to Omaha, Nebraska. He arrived at 3 a.m. central time on Monday. He began his journey at 7 a.m. Sunday at Reagan National, had to scramble to find a flight out of Dulles, went through Denver and then made it home. ""Can't wait to attempt my own trek home Tuesday,"" Young joked. American Airlines said it would add extra flights, use bigger planes where possible and reflow passengers to other flights. Passengers who were affected can switch flights with no change fees through Thursday, said Charley Wilson, airline spokesman. Continental Airlines said though flights are extremely full because of the Christmas season, staffers are working on a ""case-by-case basis"" to ensure passengers get home for the holidays. Passengers can also get a refund or change their flights for free at Continental's Web site or through the 800 number, said spokeswoman Mary Clark. Areas from the Mid-Atlantic through the Northeast set snowfall records this weekend. Record snow blanketed some areas Sunday, including 23 inches in Bethesda, Maryland, and 24 inches in Medford, New Jersey. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received 23.2 inches -- its second-highest snowfall ever in a single event. Two people were killed in weather-related crashes, the Virginia State Police said Sunday, and ""there are two additional deaths that are likely related to the winter storm."" The storm, known as a nor'easter, blanketed the mid-Atlantic region and the heavily populated Interstate 95 corridor. Meanwhile, western North Carolina residents were digging out from the powerful storm. In Washington, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty said the storm is ""perhaps the biggest we've seen in several years."" ""We are going to throw everything we have at it to keep the District open for business on this busy pre-holiday weekend,"" Fenty said when he announced the snow emergency. But, he also urged residents to stay put in their homes. ""We urge everyone if you don't have to go anywhere, wait. We should have a lot of streets ready to go by rush hour Monday. And, hopefully, all of it done between Monday and Wednesday."" Nine people were taken to a hospital after a bus and a city snow plow collided, a D.C. fire official said. The injuries were not considered serious.","Monster weekend winter storm blankets a swath of the East Coast .

325,"(CNN)  -- The U.S. Coast Guard closed 98 miles of the Mississippi River from New Orleans, Louisiana, southward after a fuel barge and a tanker collided early Wednesday, spilling more than 400,000 gallons of fuel oil. Coast Guard personnel try to contain a fuel oil spill in the Mississippi River in New Orleans on Wednesday. The closure -- on what is a major shipping route between the Midwest and the Gulf of Mexico -- could last days, and the cleanup could take weeks, said Capt. Lincoln Stroh, the Coast Guard chief in New Orleans. The collision between the Liberian-flagged chemical tanker Tintomara and the barge pushed by the tug Mel Oliver happened about 1:30 a.m.  Wednesday, splitting the barge nearly in half and dumping more than 419,000 gallons of oil into the river, the Coast Guard said. The accident happened just north of the massive bridges connecting downtown New Orleans to the west bank of the Mississippi, the Coast Guard said. The tanker was undamaged.  See a map of where the spill happened » . The Coast Guard said Wednesday evening that the tug had no properly licensed crew on board at the time of the collision. No injuries were reported, and the National Transportation Safety Board said it has dispatched investigators to look into the accident. The accident left a sheen of oil over much of the river and its banks. Booms were deployed to contain the oil, and skimmers are being used to suck it off the surface, said Petty Officer Thomas Blue, a Coast Guard spokesman.  Watch scenes from the oil spill » . The spill is much smaller than the ones that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the Coast Guard estimated that more than 7 million gallons of oil were dumped into the Mississippi and nearby waterways. But Wilma Subra, a chemist who advises the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, said the oil could affect wildlife and work its way up the food chain into residents, many of whom fish for subsistence. ""This is a spill that occurred in a very urban area, and it can impact a very large number of people,"" she said. The oil, widely used as marine fuel, is heavier than diesel but lighter than crude, and it is likely to stick to rocks, trees and wildlife, Stroh said. ""Some will evaporate with sunlight, but there will be residuals in the waterway which need to be cleaned up,"" he said. However, State Department of Environmental Quality officials said the oil is so thick that it could sink, which would complicate the cleanup, the Times-Picayune of New Orleans reported. The Mississippi is the primary source of drinking water for the region, and workers have deployed booms around intakes for local water systems, said Paul Book, the head of the cleanup effort for barge owners American Commercial Lines. Water intakes in the oil spill area -- those for Algiers, Gretna, St. Bernard Parish and Plaquemines Parish -- were closed to prevent contamination, though residents there still could get water through their taps because of reserve supplies, the Times-Picayune reported. A swifter-than-normal current quickly drew the slick downstream. The Coast Guard initially closed 29 miles of the river but expanded that to 98 miles by Wednesday evening, the service said. The heavy, sticky oil left a ""real strong"" smell hanging over much of downtown New Orleans, said Carl Bauder, who runs a barber shop near the foot of Canal Street. The Coast Guard's closure of traffic shut down commuter ferries across the river, said Bauder, who lives in the West Bank neighborhood of Algiers. ""[The oil has] done a lot of damage to our Moonwalk area and down by the aquarium,"" he said. Department of Environmental Quality officials said they didn't believe breathing the air near the river would be a problem, adding that emergency personnel were checking the air with portable monitors and hadn't found dangerous hydrocarbon levels, the Times-Picayune reported. New Orleans is among the largest U.S. ports. More than 30 ships were queued early Wednesday afternoon, waiting to pass through the closed zone, Coast Guard spokeswoman Jaclyn Young said. Ships approaching the mouth of the river from the Gulf of Mexico were being asked to stay out, Stroh said.","Ninety-eight miles of Mississippi River closed from New Orleans southward .

326,"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- Golfer Tiger Woods will be issued a careless driving citation for the crash outside his home last week, but he will not face criminal charges, the Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday. Woods, 33, struck a fire hydrant and a tree with his 2009 Cadillac SUV in his luxury neighborhood near Windermere, Florida, early Friday, police said. Upon conviction of careless driving, a moving violation, Woods faces a $164 fine and four points on his license, Maj. Cindy Williams of the Florida Highway Patrol said. ""Mr. Woods' status in no way impacted our investigation or conclusion,"" Williams said. ""The investigation has determined that Mr. Woods is at fault in the crash."" Woods satisfied the requirements of Florida law regarding motor vehicle accidents by providing his driver's license, registration and proof of insurance to authorities, Williams said. ""With the issuance of this citation, the Florida Highway Patrol has completed its investigation into this matter,"" she said. There was insufficient evidence to request a subpoena for medical information in the case, said Sgt. Kim Montes, an FHP spokeswoman. There were no claims of domestic abuse. Authorities have said they don't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home around 2:25 a.m. Friday. State troopers three times have asked to question him about the accident, but he has declined, the highway patrol has said. What do you think about the Tiger Woods saga? Police have said the accident was not alcohol-related. Woods canceled plans to attend the Chevron World Challenge in Southern California ""due to injuries sustained in a one-car accident last week,"" according to a statement Monday from the golfer. In a statement issued Sunday afternoon on his Web site, Woods offered no details of his accident except to say he had cuts and bruises and was ""pretty sore."" ""This situation is my fault, and it's obviously embarrassing to my family and me,"" he said. ""I'm human and I'm not perfect. I will certainly make sure this doesn't happen again."" Woods is a four-time winner of the tournament. A knee injury kept him from competing last year. ""I am extremely disappointed that I will not be at my tournament this week,"" Woods said. ""I am certain it will be an outstanding event, and I'm very sorry that I can't be there."" People holding tickets for the event -- which runs Wednesday through Sunday -- can apply for full refunds starting next Monday, tournament officials said. Ticketholders who do not ask for refunds can get a 20 percent discount when buying 2010 tickets, they said. The annual charity event, which Woods hosts in Thousand Oaks, California, is a major fundraiser for the Tiger Woods Foundation, but it was not immediately clear how much money it would lose because of Woods' cancellation. The incident has ended Woods' golf appearances until next season, according to a statement posted on his Web site. The PGA Tour has ended for the year, but the first tournament of the 2010 season is just five weeks away. At least one other charity event is scheduled, but it is not clear if Woods had planned to attend. Woods has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament four times each, as well as three U.S. Open Championships. Last week, a story in the National Enquirer alleged that Woods has been seeing a New York nightclub hostess. The woman denied having an affair with Woods when contacted by The Associated Press. The woman in question has retained Los Angeles lawyer Gloria Allred, who is know for handling high-profile cases, to represent her. Allred told CNN there were no immediate plans for a news conference, although she may soon release a written statement. Windermere's mayor called on the news media to back away from the story, saying, ""Our residents would like to put this behind us."" ""It's time to move on,"" Mayor Gary Bruhn said. ""Let the man recover if he is injured, and let him get back to his life, and let our residents get back to normalcy."" Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, said the Florida Highway Patrol informed them that further discussion with them is both voluntary and optional. ""Although Tiger realizes that there is a great deal of public curiosity, it has been conveyed to FHP that he simply has nothing more to add and wishes to protect the privacy of his family."" Under Florida law, Woods is not obligated to give a statement about the crash. His attorney, Mark NeJame, handed over the required documents to the troopers Sunday at Woods' home, Montes said. Investigators had sought possible surveillance tapes of the accident from neighbors, but none were found, she said. In his statement, Woods praised his wife, Elin Nordegren, who he said ""acted courageously when she saw I was hurt and in trouble."" Nordegren told police she used a golf club to break out the rear window of the vehicle, and then pulled Woods from the SUV after she heard the accident from inside their home. But Woods said, ""This is a private matter, and I want to keep it that way."" And, he added, ""The only person responsible for the accident is me."" Woods and his wife have two children, a 2-year-old and a baby born in February.

327,"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- A mudslide triggered by torrential rains may have buried up to 800 villagers in southern Taiwan, media reports said Monday, as the country counted the cost of its worst flooding in decades. A girl is carried out from mudslide caused by Typhoon Morakot in southern Taiwan on Monday. The death toll so far in Taiwan stands at 15, with 55 missing and 32 hurt, since Typhoon Morakot struck the island Friday and remained in the area over the weekend before crashing into eastern China, state-run China Daily reported. Rescuers using military helicopters managed to pluck more than 100 people to safety in the village of Hsiao Lin, as rains washed out roads and bridges in Kaohsiung County, severing all land vehicle traffic, Taiwan's Central News Agency said. Locals estimated there were about 5,000-6,000 people in the mountainous village when the typhoon struck. Journalist Andrew Lee told CNN that it was difficult to know the exact number of people stranded or dead because ""SOS"" reports were still filtering in, and damaged communication and power lines were being repaired. Watch more about the rescue effort » . He cited one report coming in that said 30 bodies had been spotted floating on the water close to a bridge in the area. According to Lee, a number of other villages in the region had been washed away or buried by mudslides, with local government officials unable to determine the number of casualties. Meanwhile, government officials said 1.5 million homes across the island were without electricity, and 440,000 were without water.  Watch as six-storey hotel topples over » . The storm -- measuring about 1,600 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) across -- continued to pummel China's populous east coast, but forecasters said it is unlikely that Morakot would reach Shanghai, the country's largest city, which sits farther north along the coast. Chinese government officials expect the typhoon to cause more than 8.5 million yuan ($1.2 billion) in damages, the newspaper said. The storm made landfall in the coastal area of Beibi town, Xiapu county, in Fujian province, about 4:20 p.m. Sunday (4:20 a.m. Sunday ET), according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. Morakot's winds were clocked at 118 kilometers per hour (73 mph) in its eye, according to the province's meteorological bureau, as cited by Xinhua. Five houses were destroyed as the front of the typhoon brought flooding rains to Wenzhou city in neighboring Zhejiang province just after 8 a.m. Sunday, Xinhua said. Three adults and a 4-year-old boy were buried in debris about 8 a.m. Rescuers could not save the child, the city's flood-control headquarters told the news agency.  Watch a dog escape as house is swept away » . A ""red alert"" -- the highest degree in danger levels -- was issued in Zhejiang, where more than 35,000 vessels were called back from sea, China Daily reported, citing provincial flood control officials. More than 300 homes collapsed, and more than 16,000 hectares (39,500 acres) were flooded, Xinhua said. The city's airport was closed and 56 roads were rendered impassable. As the eye of the storm reached Beibi, the sky turned completely dark, and people caught in rainstorms staggered as they used flashlights to see, Xinhua reported. Trees were uprooted and torn apart by damaging winds. Farmers tried to recapture large numbers of fish, flushed from mudflat fish farms by high winds, Xinhua said. Nearly 1 million people were evacuated from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces as Morakot approached. Late Friday, the storm lashed Taiwan, killing two people, wounding 15 and cutting power to about 650,000 households, according to Hong Kong's Metro Radio. Meanwhile, another storm hit western Japan on Monday, with 13 people confirmed dead. Twenty others were missing, police said. Among the victims of Typhoon Etau was a 68-year-old woman who died when a landslide caused a hill to collapse on her home in Okayama prefecture, police said. In neighboring Hyogo prefecture, an 86-year-old woman was found dead in her flooded house and a 54-year-old man in his submerged car. Officials expect the number of victims to rise as torrential rains continue.

328,"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- They're at the top of the ocean's food chain -- but it is still a mystery how the oil disaster is affecting the shark population in the Gulf of Mexico. Even if sharks never touch the oil slick, their sources of oxygen and food are at risk. And a reduced shark population could impact the entire Gulf ecosystem, according to Neil Hammerschlag, a researcher at the University of Miami, who has been studying sharks for a decade -- tagging them to determine their migratory patterns and other behaviors. Today, his research focus has changed. ""The oil spill opens up a whole new avenue for critical research,"" says Hammerschlag. As with most weekends, Hammerschlag leads a university research team packed into a boat with interns and high school students, to fish for sharks. They research the impact of the oil on sharks and other species of fish in the Gulf of Mexico. Because sharks eat nearly everything beneath them on the food chain, they provide a lot of information about the ecosystem. ""If you see high levels of oil in a shark, you better believe it's in the whole food chain,"" says Hammerschlag's assistant, Austin Gallagher. In order to take biological samples from the sharks, first they must be caught. Ten lines are baited in areas believed to be attractive to sharks. ""Sharks don't chew their food they swallow it,"" Hammerschlag says. The lines are equipped with special circle-shaped hooks to prevent the sharks from harming themselves when they swallow the bait. Swallowing a circle hook, with an inward point does not hurt the shark, Hammerschlag says. The shark swallows the bait and, as it starts to swim away, the hook turns and catches the animal's jaw. He compares it to a lip piercing. ""It heals very, very quickly,"" he says. Once a shark is on the line, it is pulled up to the side of the boat. Larger sharks are kept in the water. The researchers lean over the side of the boat and gather tissue and blood samples, before attaching a tag to the fin. The process usually takes just a few minutes from the time it is reeled in until the shark's release. The information has been used for creating protected marine areas, as well as medical research. Large sharks that migrate long distances -- bull, hammerhead, and tiger sharks -- are outfitted with satellite tracking devices with sensors. When the shark breaks the water's surface, its location is sent to a satellite. Hammerschlag then receives an e-mail containing the coordinates. The data on the sharks' movement -- published on the University of Miami's website -- will tell researchers whether the sharks encounter the oil in the Gulf of Mexico. Hammerschlag thinks the odds are high that sharks will swim through water filled with oil, but he can't be certain because there's no precedent. He's hopeful the sharks can outsmart the environmental disaster. ""There is a possibility that these animals might be able to anticipate the oil and sense the oil and actually move away from it,"" he said. Swimming through the oil could be deadly for sharks. ""Sharks breathe through the water,"" says Hammerschlag. ""They take in the water, the water goes over their gills and they extract oxygen out of the water."" If the water is mixed with oil, it would hinder their normal breathing pattern, he says. It's still too early in Hammerschlag's research to determine whether sharks are swimming through the oil. ""Hurley"" the hammerhead shark had transmitted a signal nearly every day for three months, until just a couple of days after the rig explosion that caused the oil spill. ""The tag could have failed or it could have headed off somewhere else into deep water and just not come up in the last few months,"" Hammerschlag says.  ""But that's very unlike the shark's characteristics."" Either way, as long as there are fish in the oiled area, Hammerschlag and his team will be looking at the effects on sharks. ""You know, there's fishing areas closed in the Gulf of Mexico because they don't want people catching and eating that fish,"" he said.  ""But I don't know if the sharks got the memo.""","Researcher Neil Hammerschlag has been tracking sharks for 10 years .
Now, his research is focusing on the impact of the oil spill .
Hammerschlag and his team catch sharks, then tag them with transmitters .
It's still unclear if the sharks are avoiding the oil spill .",3379 1287 122 30 192 12 0 230 5 0 2536 7 666 2735 18 13 10 117 1 2915 97 0 2099 2422 10 5056 0 8803 1390 4 0 3635 5 1991 101 63 9283 173 1478 0 2099 10336 34 1507 5 5233 3 666 28 12 694 3 1 2326 8803 1390 72 912 0 1040 3635 13380 120 2 3486 283454 1 4619 12 0 429 5 3379 25 20 29 3207 9283 6 1 1411 22508 73 2 1858 34 28840 5156 3 66 13413 182 33 721 1061 20 867 0 2099 8369 4307 39 1 654 68 3990 6 1548 721 157 283454 16 9 96 6627 283454 2439 1 429 721 233 2780 54 1 2602 9 29378 3 220 351 1197 2 2840 6 9283 30 721 0 912 5 0 2099 8 9283 3 66 3487 5 2840 4 0 3635 5 1991 82 9283 1612 471 522 3515 73 8 0 666 2735 30 717 1 276 5 447 44 0 13380 63 78 127 220 1341 5 2099 4 1 8803 78 305 270 13 7 4 0 654 666 2735 157 283454 7 1468 5501 13594 4 528 2 113 5483 4987 17 0 9283 69 30 362 22 788 945 1611 28 34123 4 815 468 2 22 4523 2 9283 9283 138 47 15572 34 666 30 10525 13 283454 157 0 1611 28 5149 9 629 283455 19180 2 1151 0 9283 17 11789 612 36 30 10525 0 16105 14658 1 4335 5814 9 23 26576 326 291 26 1472 0 8803 283454 157 0 8803 36747 0 16105 3 16 13 2323 2 5259 170 0 5814 2424 3 10438 0 1643 7 7847 27 9994 13 2 1 7854 17551 13 28124 107 107 735 27 157 267 1 8803 10 8 0 530 13 10 1128 39 2 0 284 5 0 2602 1983 9283 28 719 4 0 622 0 1699 8059 56 0 284 5 0 2602 3 3363 5165 3 950 4987 65 18421 1 4864 2 0 18378 0 660 1168 729 58 1 218 484 17 0 53 13 10 25224 4 206 0 8803 7 837 0 447 20 29 158 6 1812 3151 3305 815 16 124 16 587 721 487 9283 11 19297 188 9931 4826 49980 3 5543 9283 28 20052 9 4296 4658 2582 9 7951 36 0 8803 3520 0 622 7 2377 86 1616 10 442 2 1 4296 283454 92 4729 23 2695 3101 0 20116 0 1247 8 0 9283 1526 147 8 0 429 5 3379 7 591 42 578 1699 268 0 9283 3286 0 2099 4 0 3635 5 1991 283454 2248 0 3528 28 220 11 9283 42 5259 112 622 1978 9 2099 18 27 57 47 22 1011 82 48 7 61 8780 27 7 3925 0 9283 57 53543 0 3172 2422 48 10 1 1862 11 134 1768 295 22 260 2 10378 0 2099 3 956 0 2099 3 614 334 170 17 13 27 21 2962 112 0 2099 72 22 1842 6 9283 9283 5283 112 0 622 157 283454 30 113 4 0 622 0 622 805 56 34 36192 3 30 8745 5233 40 5 0 622 63 0 622 10 3045 9 2099 13 52 16959 34 1141 3369 4253 27 157 13 7 117 194 279 4 283454 7 721 2 1858 268 9283 28 2962 112 0 2099 20505 0 49980 8803 32 8577 1 4143 471 195 108 6 95 193 206 58 1 411 5 172 31 0 11833 3513 11 592 0 2099 8369 0 4864 72 19 632 50 13 72 19 2079 99 3000 809 54 1245 622 3 58 26 160 39 4 0 55 218 193 283454 157 18 11 7 107 2498 0 8803 7 8442 754 114 16 188 16 48 28 2840 4 0 42407 314 283454 3 33 233 42 22 293 12 0 2071 8 9283 78 143 48 7 4393 815 1250 4 0 3635 5 1991 82 30 138 47 163 62 4882 3 1869 11 2840 27 21 18 46 138 47 143 63 0 9283 178 0 9097,bef2693eadaa68afa74cfdbcac58bbccd136331b,
329,"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- More than 1,000 Russians have drowned recently as they attempted to find relief from a stifling heat wave -- many of them after drinking alcohol, officials said. Vadim Seryogin, a department head at Russia's Emergencies Ministry, told reporters Wednesday that 49 people, including two children, had drowned in the last day. More than 1,200 total have drowned, 223 of them between July 5 and July 12. ""The majority of those drowned were drunk,"" Seryogin said. ""The children died because adults simply did not look after them."" A heat wave settled over Russia in mid-June, according to the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency. The region has experienced record-breaking heat, with temperatures of up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). The heat has caused an emergency situation in Russia, according to a column on RIA-Novosti. Officials have urged citizens to take a siesta in the afternoon to avoid the hottest part of the day. Cases of heat stroke and sunburn have increased in children, and adults with heart problems and diabetes are suffering complications. Asphalt softened in the heat has been blamed for traffic accidents. A state of emergency has been declared in 14 regions, and some areas are facing water shortages as wells dry up. The heat has exacerbated a smog problem, as well, the RIA-Novosti column said, adding Russia has not experienced such heat in 130 years. Winter and spring crops are withering under the heat, the column said.","Two children among those who drowned this week .

330,"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Conson was downgraded from a typhoon early Saturday, a day after the deadly storm roared into China, along the southern tip of the island of Hainan. Conson is forecast to move through the Gulf of Tonkin on Saturday, making a final landfall in northern Vietnam, near Hanoi, in the afternoon, according to CNN World Weather. The storm, which killed at least 39 people during its westward march across the Philippines this week, had maximum sustained winds of 112 kph (70 mph) Saturday, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. At one point Friday morning, the storm's winds reached 139 kph (86 mph), making it the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane when it reached China. Southern China already had been battling severe flooding that killed 146 people over the past two weeks, destroyed about 113,000 homes and forced more than 1.2 million people to relocate this month, state media said Friday. Forty people were missing. According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, Chen Lei of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief office said the coming rain would exacerbate the flooding. Storms and floods have affected more than 35 million people in 10 China provinces this month. By Thursday, the nation had recorded at least 26 billion yuan (about $3.8 billion) in economic losses, Xinhua said. Conson had weakened from a typhoon to a tropical storm before its landfall late Tuesday in the Philippines, but that didn't keep the storm from wreaking havoc as it traversed the archipelago off the Asian mainland. Conson then traveled across the South China Sea, picking up strength. Along with the rising death toll, the Philippines' National Disaster Coordinating Council said Friday that 84 people were missing.","Conson is downgraded to a tropical storm .

331,"(CNN) -- An explosion of an apparent land mine that drifted from North Korea killed one fisherman and injured another, police said Sunday. The injured man is still hospitalized with serious injuries to his arms and hands, Yeoncheon County Police told CNN. Investigators have found 19 wooden box land mines washed up on the riverside so far, police said. Heavy downpours in North Korea may have washed the land mines ashore, the South Korean state-run Yonhap news agency reported, citing the South Korean Army. The military is searching all streams that connect with North Korea, Yonhap said, and has issued warnings to people in the area after investigators found ""scores"" of the mines, designed to go off when opened. The explosion occurred just before 11:00 p.m. Saturday (10:00 a.m. ET) in a border city 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Seoul. State media reported Saturday that South Korean investigators had found eight land mines made by North Korea near the border between the two countries. A fisherman on Jumun Island alerted authorities after stumbling upon a landmine in a wooden box, Yonhap said, citing a spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Searchers found seven other mines on Jumum and two other islands in the Yellow Sea, as well as three empty wooden boxes, Yonhap said. It was unclear how the land mines were identified. According to Yonhap, military officials said the mines may have drifted away from North Korea. Jumun Island is just below the sea border between the two countries, Yonhap said.

332,"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama met Wednesday with Haitian President Rene Preval to discuss relief, recovery and reconstruction efforts in Haiti. The two leaders pledged to continue working for a more coordinated, sustained global relief effort to help Haiti recover from a massive 7.0-magnitude earthquake that struck January 12. Much of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, was destroyed, and more than 217,000 people were killed, according to the latest figures from international relief organizations. The situation on the ground in Haiti ""remains dire,"" Obama said at the White House. A continuing desperate need for food, medicine and shelter will be exacerbated by the onset of Haiti's spring rain season, he said. ""You will continue to have a steady and reliable partner in the United States of America,"" Obama promised Preval. Preval extended his thanks ""not only for the material aid"" from the United States, but also for America's ""psychological response,"" which made Haitians realize ""we were not alone."" Washington has already provided $700 million in aid to Haiti. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday a donors conference is planned in New York for the end of March. More than half of all United States households have made private contributions to Haitian relief, Clinton said. Preval said Tuesday his country is working to get its election timetable rescheduled, telling reporters after meeting with Clinton that political stability is ""fundamental"" for the development of a country. ""I think that is what constitutes a guarantee for investors, for the population -- that there's some guarantees, that there's some security about their future,"" he said. Parliamentary elections set for February were postponed, and it is unclear whether a presidential election scheduled for the fall can proceed. Clinton said she assured Preval ""that the United States would work with the international community to hold elections as soon as appropriate.""

A 17-member crew on board a freighter was hit by the storm -- also known as Typhoon Dianmu -- and 14 of the members were still missing Monday, according to the Phillippines National Disaster Coordinating Council. Three of the 17 were located -- one dead, and two others alive. A 13-year-old boy was also reported missing after being swept away by a strong current while swimming in the Santa Clara River, the disaster council said. More than 200 families from a community in the northern province of Bulacan were evacuated Sunday, and nearly 150 of them were still housed in shelters Monday, the council said. The storm was expected to strengthen as it headed to China and complicate the response to flooding cause by heavy rains in recent weeks, according to the country's national meteorological agency.

336,"CISHAN, Taiwan (CNN) -- Taiwan's leader Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday he accepts responsibility for the government's slow response after Typhoon Morakot slammed into the island killing at more than 120 people and unleashing floods, mudslides and misery. Mourners kneel and pray to the dead as they face the devastated valley of Shiao Lin. Ma, who has faced heavy criticism from victims of the disaster, ruled out resignation, insisting his government did its best in the face of difficulties, however he pledged an investigation into any irregularities. ""Certainly, I will take full responsibility whatever the blame is because, after all, I am the president of this country,"" Ma told CNN, saying heavy rains grounded rescue helicopters in the first few days after the storm hit, delaying relief. ""Once the weather was good -- that is the 14th of August -- we were able to evacuate 2,518 people. It's a record,"" he said. Hundreds of people still await rescue in remote areas of Taiwan, where torrential downpours, dense fog, rugged terrain and raging rivers have hampered relief efforts. Washed-out roads and collapsed bridges have made some rescue operations impossible . Touring disaster areas, Ma has been confronted by angry survivors, and even provoked a scuffle when he opened a weekend baseball game as protesters demanded he step down. Ma has offered apologies and promises to do better. ""We will find out not only to correct the mistakes but (also) to punish the people responsible,"" he said. Rescue efforts were ongoing Sunday with military helicopters bringing stranded villagers to their waiting relatives.  Watch rescue efforts in Taiwan » . Others, waiting days in anguish for word on their loved ones, lashed out in anger. ""Local officials don't care,"" one man said. ""There are still people there and they don't do anything."" On Saturday, weeping relatives of typhoon victims set up shrines near devastated villages to calm the spirits of the dead and honor the belief that their souls will return home after seven days.  Watch mourners call home souls of the dead » . Morakot hit the island last weekend, dropping 2.6 meters (102 inches) of rain. Before it roared on to mainland China on Sunday, the storm killed at least 123 people in Taiwan. The death toll could climb to more than 300 after more villagers buried by mudslides and floodwaters are found, Taiwan officials have said. Southern and central Taiwan were hardest hit by the storm. Mudslides inundated some places in the south, including the village of Shiao Lin, where 160 homes were lost. Authorities believe hundreds of people could be trapped under five stories of mud in the village. International aid efforts were mobilizing on Sunday, however these were complicated by diplomatic pitfalls in the face of China's territorial claims over Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province awaiting reunification. The U.S. military has begun a ""modest"" humanitarian aid mission to Taiwan with the dispatch of a Marine Corps C-130 cargo plane carrying plastic tarpaulins for shelter, U.S. defense officials said. Also Sunday, the USS Denver was en route to the Taiwanese coast with additional humanitarian aid and water purification capabilities, the officials said. The Navy ship is expected to arrive Monday, but officials could not say when it will launch its heavy-lift helicopters to drop the aid. Sources in Washington have said in providing aid to Taiwan, the United States must be sensitive to its territorial relationship with China.

337,"(CNN) -- Ten years after 113 people died when a Concorde jet crashed into a hotel outside Paris, local officials say the country's government has not done enough to protect people living near the airport. ""Seventy-five percent of air accidents have happened in taking off or landing in densely populated areas,"" Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy said in a statement. The town of Gonesse, located north of Paris, was scheduled to hold a memorial service Sunday to honor the 113 victims who died when the Concorde jet crashed there on July 25, 2000. A court is expected to rule in a manslaughter case related to the crash in December, a statement from Gonesse's government said. ""Despite 10 years of investigation and four months of trial, all the responsibility does not seem to have been established,"" the statement said. French investigators said a small titanium strip that was loose caused the crash. It had fallen from a Continental Airlines plane on the runway minutes earlier.

338,"(CNN) -- With nearly 86,000 people evacuated from fire-ravaged regions, Russian authorities said Sunday that firefighters were gaining control over blazes sweeping across thousands of acres in western Russia. ""Despite complicated weather conditions, the situation is under control thanks to preventive measures and efforts taken by the Russian Emergencies Ministry,"" a spokesman for the ministry told the Itar-Tass news agency. At least 28 people have been killed and thousands left homeless by the wildfires, which are among the worst ever to hit western Russia. No fire-related deaths were reported since Friday, officials said Sunday. Two firefighters were among the dead, Itar-Tass reported, citing the Emergency Ministry. Latest figures from the ministry showed that 128,500 hectares (317,530 acres) were burned or had burned, and 774 ""hotbeds of wildfire"" were counted as of 6 a.m. Sunday. About half the fires had either been extinguished or contained, the ministry spokesman said. ""The most difficult situation with wildfires remains in the Nizhny Novgorod, Vladimir and Voronezh regions and the Republic of Mordovia, where fires threaten several populated settlements,"" the ministry's information department said. A hot, dry summer has been a key factor in the fires, drying out large parts of land and igniting the peat bogs that lie all over central Russia. Moscow, Russia, hit a temperature of 39 Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) on Thursday, the highest temperature since records began in 1879. The fires have destroyed more than 1,200 homes, the ministry said, and nearly 5,000 people have been left homeless. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from the village of Maslovka, Russia, near Voronezh, that almost every house in the village of 500 people had burned to the ground. All the residents of Maslovka had been evacuated to nearby hotels. A resident of Maslovka named Nina told Chance she had returned to the village after the fire to sift through the rubble of the house where she was born. For 50 years, she said, she lived under the same roof. A few days ago, the wildfires were swept by high winds to the village and quickly engulfed her house. Now there was nothing left. Even the clothes she was wearing were not hers -- they had been given to her by a neighbor. As Nina told her story, an elderly woman walked from behind a broken wall, wailing with tears. Nina said the woman was her mother, devastated she had lost the home where she raised her family. Russia's government has vowed to compensate the more than 1,870 families whose houses have been burned down. Amid complaints, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered regional governors to speed up the compensation process. The Kremlin has called the wildfires a natural disaster of the kind that appear every 30 or 40 years. Critics, meanwhile, accuse local authorities of mismanaging the response. Desperate to control the blazes, Russia says its deployed nearly a quarter of a million people to fight the fires. But around Voronezh, many of the firefighters that Chance saw were just volunteers with buckets.","About half of the hundreds of wildfires in Russia are extinguished or contained .

339,"(CNN) -- The deadly flash floods that swept through remote Arkansas valleys, killing some campers and leaving many others missing, are a grim reminder of the sudden nature of flash floods and the importance of being prepared for emergencies. Emergency preparedness is important at any time, as emergencies are more common than people may think. However, being prepared for emergency situations is even more critical when people are out in the wilderness and further away from phones or cell phone access, hospitals and emergency help. More than 40 percent of Americans plan to go hiking or camping this summer, second in popularity only to swimming as a summer activity, according to a recent Red Cross survey. However, the survey also found that less than two-thirds of Americans feel prepared to respond to a serious outdoor emergency such as broken bones, animal bites or heat stroke. Flash floods are a serious threat to summer campers and hikers, especially in narrow valleys where heavy rains can cause water to rise quickly. Media reports from Arkansas say that after more than a half foot of rain, water in the Caddo and Little Missouri rivers rose quickly overnight -- at times faster than 8 feet per hour -- inundating campgrounds in remote valleys and catching many campers asleep. The American Red Cross has a series of preparedness tips that people should follow: . • Share your travel plans with a family member, neighbor or friend . • Listen to area radio and television stations and a NOAA Weather Radio for possible flood warnings and reports of flooding in progress or other critical information from the National Weather Service. • Be prepared to evacuate at a moment's notice. • When a flood or flash flood warning is issued for your area, head for higher ground and stay there. • Stay away from floodwaters. If you come upon a flowing stream where water is above your ankles, stop, turn around and go another way -- 6 inches of swiftly moving water can sweep you off of your feet. • If you come upon a flooded road while driving, turn around and go another way. • If you are caught on a flooded road and waters are rising rapidly around you, get out of the car quickly and move to higher ground. Most cars can be swept away by less than 2 feet of moving water. • Keep children out of the water, as their curiosity could cause them to get too close to fast-moving flood waters. • Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood danger. Download our Flood Safety checklist, visit redcross.org or contact your local Red Cross for additional information on how to prepare for emergencies and to get trained. Recognizing the importance of preparedness for people who are hiking or camping, the Red Cross this year began offering a new Wilderness and Remote First Aid course designed to teach people how to respond to an emergency in a setting where emergency help is more than one hour away -- from treating severe wounds and broken bones to dealing with animal bites, bee stings, plant poisoning and weather emergencies. The course includes recommendations for the contents of wilderness and remote area first aid kits, and offers training on what to do in emergencies that include allergic reactions, altitude sickness, sprains, fractures, burns, heat-related illness, hypothermia, lightning strikes, heart attacks, drowning, wound treatment and snakebite. With summer starting and more people getting outside, it is important that families include emergency preparedness in the summer planning. Sadly, severe weather and summer are inseparable. Preparedness is especially important for people who will be hiking or camping in remote areas.

340,"(CNN) -- English Premier League side Liverpool are waiting to find out the extent of the injury suffered by Spain striker Fernando Torres during the closing stages of the World Cup final. The 26-year-old, a late substitute in Spain's 1-0 extra-time victory over the Netherlands, pulled up as he chased a long ball, before collapsing to the ground and thumping his fist on the ground. He recovered enough to play a part in Spain's celebrations and returned to Madrid on Monday with his victorious team-mates. A statement on Liverpool's website confirmed the injury as a left adductor problem, although the severity is not yet known. Torres endured an injury-disrupted season with Liverpool, and came into the World Cup after a six week layoff following his second knee operation. He has been linked with a big-money move away from the Reds, who slumped to a disappointing seventh-place finish last season. But in a separate item, Liverpool's website featured pictures of Torres holding the World Cup while wearing the team's scarf, an image that may reassure fans desperate to keep hold of one of their prize assets. Meanwhile, Manchester United departed for their pre-season tour of the United States without a number of their best-known players. Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Nemanja Vidic have all been left at home to recover from the World Cup, while Gary Neville, Michael Owen, Antonio Valencia, Anderson and Owen Hargreaves are all recovering from injuries. However, new signings Chris Smalling and Javier Hernandez are making the trip.

341,"(CNN) -- Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon will be sidelined for three months following successful back surgery in Milan. The Juventus player underwent the operation on Sunday to repair a herniated disc in his back, and said afterwards he is in no hurry to return to action. ""I feel relieved now,"" Buffon told Juventus' official website. ""The intervention went well and this gives me faith and serenity. I must not hurry. ""I need to take the due time to come back with no trouble and no risk of recurrence."" The 32-year-old suffered the injury in Italy's opening World Cup match against Paraguay in Group F, which forced him to miss the rest of the tournament in South Africa. The world champions suffered without Buffon, finishing bottom of the group as they failed to make it past the first round of the competition. Buffon, who has won the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award a record nine times, is looking forward to working with new Italy manager Cesare Prandelli, who replaces the departed Marcello Lippi. ""Considering my role, I think my career is still a long one and without the hernia I would have been able to lengthen it further,"" Buffon told Italian newspaper La Repubblica. ""My future with the national team? I believe I deserve my place. ""I've had Prandelli as a rival coach since my youth years and I knew back then that he has an exceptional rapport with his players. He is part of the group and I think that is very important."" Buffon, who has 102 caps, will replace Fabio Cannavaro as Italy's captain once he is fit again following the defender's retirement from international duty after the World Cup exit. He was previously national skipper at Euro 2008 when Cannavaro was ruled out by injury. Meanwhile, Juventus announced the season-long loan signing of Udinese defender Marco Motta on Monday. The 24-year-old, who spent last season at Roma as part of a co-ownership agreement, has been training with his new teammates in Pinzolo since Saturday ahead of the move. The Turin club has the option to buy the right-back at the end of the loan deal.","Italy star Gianluigi Buffon aims for a successful recovery following a back operation .

342,"(CNN) -- Hundreds of family members, friends and neighbors of four of the eight victims of a workplace shooting rampage gathered at funeral services around Manchester, Connecticut, on Saturday to share tears and memories. The four men who were laid to rest had each worked at Hartford Distributors for around 30 years before Omar Thornton's shooting spree Tuesday, which ended when he took his own life. ""We're a pretty tight neighborhood,"" said Mary Bey of South Windsor, at the funeral of Craig Pepin, 60, who she described as a ""wonderful neighbor and friend and coach and referee."" ""He touched so many people's lives in South Windsor ... he was a very unique, kind and wonderful man,"" she told CNN Connecticut affiliate WTNH. Bey also knows a Hartford Distributors employee who was injured in the rampage. ""We're very happy he made it through,"" she said of Steven Hollander, a neighbor who was treated and released from Hartford Hospital. Besides Pepin, Bryan Cirigliano, 51, Douglas Scruton, 56, and Victor James, who was killed on his 61st birthday, were also buried Saturday. ""We've just had an outpouring of support,"" James' daughter told WTNH. ""And it just felt good to hear the stories and just to see the amount of people that came to see my dad."" Funeral services for two other shooting victims are scheduled for Sunday and Monday, and a candlelight vigil for those killed is scheduled for Sunday evening in Manchester's Center Park. Connecticut Gov. M. Jodi Rell has called for Monday to be a day of remembrance for the victims, asking state residents to observe a moment of silence at 9:15 a.m. On Friday, police arrested a woman they said had accepted stolen beer from a delivery truck driven by Thornton. Hartford Distributors said it had asked Thornton to resign after it found him stealing and selling alcoholic beverages. Thornton's girlfriend told CNN he was being racially harassed at work, but Hartford Distributors' president said Thursday that there were no grievances filed with the company or with Thornton's union.","The four men had worked for Hartford Distributors for around 30 years .

343,"(CNN) -- Two people aboard a twin-engine airplane were killed Saturday when it crashed into a house in western Pennsylvania, sending the homeowner fleeing with his dog, officials said. Westmoreland County Public Safety spokesman Dan Stevens said skies were clear when the aircraft ""just spun in its own axis"" and hit the Saltsburg area house, sparking a fire that consumed the plane and the house. The plane took off from Arnold Palmer Regional Airport outside Latrobe, about 50 miles from the crash scene, Stevens said. The Beechcraft Baron BE58 crashed 11 minutes later at 9:19 a.m., FAA spokesman Jim Peters said. The six-seat plane landed next to a man who was sleeping on a couch with his dog in the home, Stevens said. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette identified him as Steve Yanko. ""There was somebody on his shoulder this morning,"" Stevens said of Yanko, who told him he was only about 15 feet away from the plane's impact. Yanko's wife was not at home at the time, Stevens said. The county coroner will identify the two victims and their names will be released after next of kin are formally notified, officials said. Stevens said the experienced pilot of the plane had recently purchased the aircraft and was at the controls. The other individual was an instructor who was flying along to ensure the owner was comfortable with the twin-engine plane, he said. The FAA's Peters said he could not confirm the role of the two people onboard. The FAA was on scene Saturday. Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board will arrive Sunday.

345,"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Tropical storm Ida could regain hurricane status Saturday night as it heads toward the Gulf Coast. The northern Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico is under a hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning, the National Hurricane Center said. Pinar del Rio, in western Cuba, is also under a tropical storm warning, the center said. During a hurricane watch, hurricane conditions are possible within 36 hours. Tropical storm conditions are possible within 24 hours under a tropical storm watch. Ida made landfall as a hurricane Thursday morning over east central Nicaragua, pelting the Central American nation with heavy rain before weakening to a tropical storm. At 7 p.m. ET, Ida was heading north-northwest at about 10 mph (17 kph) and was about 180 miles (290 km) east-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico, the hurricane center said. Track Ida's projected path . Forecasters expect the storm, with winds of 70 mph (110 kph), to reach hurricane status by Saturday night or early Sunday. If the storm becomes a hurricane again, however, it could lose power and downgrade back to a tropical storm in the coming days. As Ida crosses the Yucatan Channel, the Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba could get 3 to 5 inches of rain; some areas could see as many as 10 inches, the center said. The Gulf Coast could experience heavy rain and coastal flooding next week as Ida approaches the area. Ida is the Atlantic region's ninth named storm. The Atlantic hurricane season ends November 30.

346,"CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico (CNN) -- Jimena remained a tropical storm Thursday afternoon, but was losing its punch as it remained nearly stationary over Mexico's Baja California, the National Hurricane Center said. After making landfall on Baja California, Hurricane Jimena started weakening Wednesday night. All tropical storm warnings on the Baja California peninsula were discontinued, but a tropical storm warning remained in effect for northwestern mainland Mexico, from Huatabampito to Bahia Kino. A tropical storm warning means conditions including winds of at least 39 mph are expected within 24 hours. Jimena made landfall Wednesday afternoon as a Category 1 hurricane between Puerto San Andresito and San Juanico, Mexico, on the peninsula. At its peak, it was a Category 4 hurricane prior to making landfall. But as of 2 p.m., Jimena's center was located about 35 miles (55 km) north of Santa Rosalia, Mexico, forecasters said, and was ""moving very little during the past few hours."" The storm was expected to begin slowly traveling west or west-southwest later Thursday night, and forecast to be near or over central Baja California through Saturday. Jimena's maximum sustained winds were near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts, forecasters said. ""Weakening is forecast during the next 24 hours, and Jimena is forecast to become a tropical depression tonight and degenerate into a remnant low by Friday.""  Watch Jimena skirt resort of Cabo San Lucas » . The storm was expected to produce an additional 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) of rain over portions of western Mexico, and 1 to 2 inches (2 to 5 cm) over the central portion of the Baja peninsula over the next day or so, the Hurricane Center said. Overall, isolated maximum amounts could reach 30 inches (76 cm), forecasters said.  Watch damage caused by Jimena » . ""An unofficial report from San Carlos, Mexico, located in Sonora state just west of Guyamas, indicates that about 25 inches of rain has fallen,"" forecasters said.

347,"Nowshera, Pakistan (CNN) -- The start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan coincided in Pakistan on Wednesday with the nation's worst natural disaster, the staggering scope of human suffering revealing itself in wretched ways. From the Swat Valley in the north to Sindh province in the south, as many as 15 million Pakistanis have been affected by torrential monsoon rains that have washed away villages and bloated rivers, authorities said Wednesday. Pakistan's representative to the United Nations said many people have not yet grasped the massive scale of Pakistan's suffering and warned it could still get worse because of ongoing rain. ""It is horrendous,"" said Abdullah Hussain Haroon. ""It is going to put us back so many years that we're not even starting on the infrastructure."" The Pakistan Disaster Authority confirmed 1,313 deaths Wednesday. It said 1,588 people have been injured and 352,291 people have been rescued. More than 722,000 houses have been damaged. Many Pakistanis now face severe food shortages, and aid agencies stepped up appeals for global assistance. The United Nations launched a flash appeal for $460 million in humanitarian assistance, and the United States pledged another $20 million on top of the $35 million already pledged. The Pakistani military has 55 helicopters and 621 boats taking part in aid and rescue efforts. For many parts of southern Pakistan, the worst is yet to come. The Indus River is expected to crest Thursday in parts of Sindh, according to the Pakistani Meteorological Department. And Pakistanis will be forced to endure the consequences of damaged infrastructure and crops lost to flooding for months. Nowshera's Khushal Pur market, once a vibrant place of 250 food stalls, stood covered in thick, foul-smelling sludge as tractors worked to remove the mud and debris. Among the muck were tons of rotting produce that shop keepers abandoned when they fled the flooding. Juma Gul surveyed the damage. His vegetable stall has been a family business for two decades. He said he has lost more than $1,000 in business, a huge amount in this town in northwestern Pakistan, where the CIA World Factbook estimated the average annual income at $2,600. Gul, who set up a temporary stall on the road, said prices of fresh produce, including tomatoes and cucumbers, have doubled. That made customer Niaz Ali anxious. He has already lost work and money is tight, but with the cost of food soaring, he said he and his family will simply have to eat less. Market manager Ikram Ullah said it would be particularly difficult during the month of Ramadan, when Muslims abstain from food and water during the day and break their fast with a feast at sunset. The back-breaking clean-up tasks will be hard, too, because of Ramadan fasting. The economic impact of the disaster is sure to be felt for a long time with crops sitting in soggy fields. ""The crop has been lost and it is a race against time to ensure the next sowing season can be met,"" said United Nations special envoy Jean-Maurice Ripert. John Holmes, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said the disaster is ""one of the most challenging that any country has faced in recent years."" Although the death toll is lower, the 14 million people affected are more than those affected in the 2005 Pakistan earthquakes, the 2004 Indonesia tsunami and the January earthquake in Haiti combined. ""The death toll has so far been relatively low compared to other major natural disasters, but the numbers affected are extraordinarily high,"" Holmes said. ""If we don't act fast enough, many more people could die of diseases and food shortages."" Holmes said thousands of villages and at least 288,000 homes have been destroyed. ""Six thousand villages wiped out the face of the earth,"" Haroon said. ""From 5,000 to 50,000 per village, we have no way of counting. We have nothing operational as to how many of those have died and how many are alive."" Huge swaths of Pakistan remain without power, clean water or communication. Bridges and roads have been destroyed, and many regions are accessible only by air or water transport. Millions of hectares of crops have been washed away in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK), Punjab and Sindh, and seed stocks have been destroyed, ""severely compromising the possibility to plant staple food crops in September for hundreds of thousands of farmers,"" Holmes said. The floods, which started in Pakistan's northern regions, are traveling through the southern province of Sindh. ""Millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains and unprecedented water levels in the rivers,"" Holmes said. ""The monsoon could last for at least another month, worsening the flooding we have seen so far."" The money will enable U.N. organizations, international partners and NGOs to partner with the Pakistani government to address emergency needs of flood-affected families, Holmes says. The agencies will provide food, drinking water, tents and supplies in the seven hardest-hit areas: Balochistan, Punjab, the Federally Administered Tribal Area, Gilgit Baltistan, KPK, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir and Sindh. The U.N. reports $99.5 million has been pledged, and donors have committed or contributed $47.8 million to the U.N. emergency response in Pakistan, but $300 million more is needed. Individual countries have also gotten involved. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on Wednesday authorized 19 Marine and Navy heavy-lift helicopters to Pakistan to relieve six U.S. Army helicopters that have been taking part in flood relief since Saturday. The new group of helicopters will come from units on board the USS Peleliu which has been off the coast of western Pakistan in recent days in anticipation of orders to assist. Gates said the USS Kearsarge -- another helicopter landing ship -- is headed to Pakistan to relieve the Peleliu. Gates said the Pakistanis will decide the speed of distribution. ""We want to be as helpful as we can be,"" he said. ""We don't want to overstretch the capacity of the Pakistanis to absorb the help."" Also Wednesday, Germany said it was increasing aid for flood victims to about $12.8 million. In total, about $600 million in aid is heading to Pakistan -- the equivalent of about $40 for each of the nation's 15 million residents. Islamic militants, however, called on the Pakistani government to reject any aid provided by the United States for flood relief. ""For the sake of God, don't accept donations from the U.S. because they are our enemies,"" said Azem Tariq, spokesman for the Taliban in Pakistan.  ""Whatever amount the U.S. will give as donation, we will give the government of Pakistan more."" Many Pakistanis have not been happy with the government's response to the floods, calling it slow and ineffective.  The Taliban's offer of aid may be an attempt to win the hearts and minds of flood victims. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has taken much of the heat. He was in England for talks with British Prime Minister David Cameron during the worst of the crisis. CNN's Reza Sayah, Dan Rivers, Samson Desta, Brooke Elliott and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","The death toll now tops 1,313, Pakistani authorities say .

348,"(CNN) -- A family of four is dead after a man driving the wrong way on an interstate highway in Idaho slammed into them head-on, authorities said. Amado Herrera, 48, of California, was driving west on Interstate 84 near Glenns Ferry, Idaho, with three passengers when a pickup truck slammed into them Thursday night, Idaho State Police said. Eusebio Jacobo Pineda, 45, was driving his Ford F-150 the wrong way on the highway shortly before 8:50 p.m. when he hit Herrera's Nissan four-door, police said. Herrera and his passengers died instantly. Pineda was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. Others in Herrera's car were identified as Luz Herrera, age unknown, Ivette Herrera, 18, and Antoni Herrera, 9. All are from South El Monte, California. All of the Herreras were wearing seatbelts, police said in a written release. It's not known whether Pineda wore a safety belt, they said. Pineda's truck rolled after impact, police said, and local media images showed the entire front end of Herrera's car crushed. Traffic on Interstate 84 was blocked for about four hours Thursday night. Police told CNN Friday that the crash is still under investigation. No criminal charges had been filed.","A family of four was killed by a wrong-way driver in Idaho on Thursday, police say .

349,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A second wave of floodwater is expected to wash through southern Pakistan this weekend, adding hundreds of thousands of people to the number already stranded by a first wave earlier this month, Pakistani officials said. At least 1,384 people have died and another 1,630 have been injured by flooding that has damaged or destroyed 8,300 Pakistani villages so far, according to National Disaster Management Authority spokesman Ahmed Kamal. The United Nations said it was racing against time to reach the suffering. ""Relief supplies must reach women, men and children as soon as possible, in order to avoid further death caused by waterborne diseases and food shortages,"" said Martin Mogwanja, the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator for Pakistan. ""The death toll has so far been relatively low compared to other major natural disasters, and we want to keep it that way,"" he said. Two of 19 military helicopters pledged by the United States arrived in Islamabad, Pakistan, on Thursday to help in the humanitarian relief efforts, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. These aircraft replace six U.S. Army helicopters that will return to duty in Afghanistan, the embassy spokesman said. The Army helicopters rescued more than 3,000 people and delivered relief supplies since arriving in Pakistan on August 5, the spokesman said. Farther north, more than 100 U.S. troops are on the ground in the volatile Swat valley, helping the Pakistani government deliver supplies and rescue people from flood-ravaged areas. None have yet encountered Taliban fighters. ""Obviously there's a militant threat in this region, but the Pakistani military has done an incredibly committed job -- providing us multiple layers of security around our units,"" said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Michael Nagata in a conference call from Pakistan. ""All our activities and helicopters are completely safe."" The bigger problem, said Nagata, is the weather. In the last two weeks, air crews have only been able to fly five days because of the relentless monsoon rains. The initial wave of the flooding came after torrential rains two weeks ago filled rivers in northern Pakistan that swept southward. Weather experts said a year's worth of rain fell in a day at the peak of the relentless downpours. A second wave of floodwater from rain that fell in northern and central Pakistan the next week is now reaching the Sindh province in southern Pakistan, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. An apparent bottleneck of water from the first flood wave at the Sukkar dam could be overtaken by the second wave, Miller said. ""This could lead to a situation where the two flood waves could build upon each other and lead to even more catastrophic flooding,"" Miller said. Pakistan emergency officials predicted the second wave could reach Sukkar on Saturday evening. Hundreds of thousands of people living along the Indus River in northern Sindh could be stranded along with the tens of thousands stranded by the first wave, said Pakistani Navy Lt. Commander Jawad Khawaja. Many residents have ignored government warnings to evacuate the area, causing a big concern, Khawaja said. More than 14 million Pakistanis are affected, with 400,000 rescued from floodwaters, the government said. It estimated that 723,950 homes have been damaged or destroyed. In  the mountainous north, water funneled down treacherous slopes, quickly engulfing the roads below. It surged down the Indus River, spreading economic, political and social woes through the heart of Pakistan. The smell of bodies filled the air in many places, where mere seconds of unstoppable water ended lives. Many witnesses, even those who thought they had seen everything in this land marred by crisis and killing, said they were stunned by the suffering wrought by the monsoons. U.S. President Barack Obama, in a statement marking the 63rd anniversary of Pakistan's independence on Friday, said, ""We will remain committed to helping Pakistan and will work side by side with you and the international community toward a recovery that brings back the dynamic vitality of your nation."" CNN's Chris Lawrence and Samson Desta contributed to this report.","Officials fear hundreds of thousands more could be stranded .

350,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor was rushed to a Los Angeles, California, hospital Friday because of ""complications"" relating to her recent hip replacement surgery, her publicist said. Her husband called an ambulance to their Bel Air home to take the actress to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on Friday afternoon, spokesman John Blanchette said. Gabor, 93, had returned home on Wednesday, three weeks after undergoing surgery to replace a hip broken in a fall from her bed. Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, said her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt.  The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953, ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""","Gabor suffered ""complications"" from hip surgery .

351,"(CNN) -- Two of the four survivors of this week's crash on an Alaska mountainside were well enough to talk with government officials looking into the cause of the crash, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairwoman Deborah Hersman told reporters on Friday. Both survivors recalled the pilot giving a safety briefing before the flight, she said. The survivor who sat in the front seat reported falling asleep almost immediately after the plane took off and waking up after the crash. The other survivor told investigators ""they were flying along and then just stopped flying,"" according to Hersman, who did not say which of the four survivors investigators spoke with. Five people died in the Monday night crash, including former U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens. The family of experienced pilot Terry Smith, who was killed in the accident, released a statement Friday saying, ""This is a time of great sorrow for our family. Our hearts and prayers go out to the survivors and the family and friends of all those affected by this tremendous loss."" Smith had been involved in a prior accident, in 1997, said Hersman. No one was injured in that accident, in which the plane nosed over during landing. The incident was chalked up to the pilot's failure to maintain control, she said. Those killed in the crash could not have been saved even if rescue teams had arrived at the site immediately, officials said. The autopsies found the deaths were the result of blunt force trauma, said Greg Wilkinson, an official at the Medical Examiner's office. He said the state medical examiner, Dr. Katherine Raven, found the injuries to be consistent with this type of crash. Raven also found that the injuries were not survivable, he said. Meanwhile, the condition of former NASA chief Sean O'Keefe has been upgraded from critical to serious, according to the Providence Alaska Medical Center. He was the most seriously injured of the four survivors. ""Sean is making significant improvements,"" an O'Keefe family spokesman said on Friday. ""... It does not appear that any of Sean's injuries require surgery. And we are encouraged by medical reports indicating that Sean's injuries are not life-threatening."" O'Keefe suffered a dislocated hip, which has been corrected, according to a statement by family spokesman Paul Pastorek. Despite initial reports, there was no serious trauma to O'Keefe's pelvis, the statement said. The condition of Sean O'Keefe's son, Kevin, has been upgraded from serious to fair, said Pastorek. ""Despite suffering serious injuries that have required surgery, Kevin is also showing dramatic improvement,"" the statement said. ""Even so, he is very much on the mend."" Survivor Jim Moorhard remained in fair condition, while William Phillips, whose father died in the crash, remained in good condition, said the Providence Alaska Medical Center. Federal officials are continuing to probe the cause of the crash, said NTSB's Hersman. They are waiting to speak with the remaining two survivors. Investigators are also working to examine the wreckage of the plane. ""Right now, we're really in the fact-gathering stage of our investigation,"" said Hersman.

352,"(CNN) -- Police in Buffalo, New York said Saturday evening that they have arrested and charged a suspect in connection with a shooting spree that left four dead outside a downtown restaurant earlier in the day. The Buffalo Police Department said 25-year old Keith Johnson is in custody and has been charged with four counts of second degree murder. Authorities would not comment on whether Johnson knew his alleged victims. Eight people hit by bullets in the early morning rampage, police say. One of the four survivors is in critical condition. At a news conference Saturday, Police Commissioner Daniel Derenda said that the dead -- two men and two women -- included a Texas man who was celebrating his wedding anniversary. About 100 people were at the City Grill when the shootings occurred, and patrons were asked to leave the restaurant's bar after some sort of argument, police said. City Grill posted a message on its website on Saturday, saying that it is ""cooperating fully with the authorities and the ongoing investigation."" It added, ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.""

353,"(CNN) -- Two miners who died this week in a Nevada mining accident were identified Saturday, according to the mine's owner. Crews late Friday found the bodies of Daniel Patrick Noel, 47, and Ethan Joel Schorr, 38, both of Spring Creek, Nevada, Barrick Gold Corp. said in a statement. Noel is survived by a wife and three children. Schorr is survived by a wife and four children. Their bodies were found about 1,300 feet underground, Barrick said. The accident occurred at 1:15 a.m. (4:15 a.m. ET) on Thursday in Elko County, Nevada. According to Barrick, two miners in an elevator were inspecting a large pipe in a vertical shaft when the pipe fell into the shaft, damaging the elevator. All underground operations at the Meikle mine were suspended, the company said. ""This is a tragic event and we remain focused on assisting these miners' families,"" Greg Lang, president of Barrick's North America region, said in a statement. ""The hearts and prayers of every Barrick employee are with them at this time. We place great value in our coworkers' health and safety, and we will do everything we can to prevent an incident like this from happening again."" The company said Barrick and the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration worked for more than 32 hours to reach the area where the bodies were found. The MSHA reports at least 53 fatalities so far this year, including at least 42 coal-related deaths and at least 11 metal-related deaths.","NEW: Two dead miners survived by spouses, children .

354,"(CNN) -- Federal investigators, joined by local officials and others, spread across Alaska on Thursday seeking the cause of a plane crash that killed five people, including former U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens. Deborah Hersman, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters that the initial investigation of the crashed airplane was complete. The wreckage would be hauled to nearby Dillingham, Alaska, to be examined further, Hersman said. There was no new information on what caused the plane to crash Monday on a rugged mountainside in southwestern Alaska, killing Stevens and four others. Another four passengers survived, including former NASA head Sean O'Keefe. Stevens, who served in the U.S. Senate for 40 years, was 86. His funeral will be held next Wednesday at 2 p.m. (6 p.m. ET) at the Anchorage Baptist Temple in Anchorage, according to Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. O'Keefe remained in critical condition on Thursday, according to Kirsten Schultz, a spokeswoman for Providence Alaska Medical Center. The condition of O'Keefe's son, Kevin, was upgraded to fair from serious. Another survivor, lobbyist Jim Morhard of Alexandria, Virginia, was also upgraded to fair from serious. Thirteen year-old William Phillips, whose father died in the crash, remained in good condition, Schultz said. A CNN reporter who flew over the crash site Thursday said there was a wide, brown swath cut through the trees by the plane. The crash occurred about 1,000 feet up the 2,300-foot mountain in an area called Muklung Hills, about a 20-minute flight from Dillingham, the reporter said. Hersman said the de Havilland DHC-3 Otter involved in the crash was manufactured in 1957 and overhauled in 2005 from a piston to a turbine engine. She also confirmed the plane lacked either a Ground Proximity Warning System or an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System. The devices, which Hersman said are not required, help pilots determine how far they are above ground or terrain and can predict whether a plane is on a path toward an obstacle or mountains. Hersman said it was too soon to know whether any technological factor contributed to the crash. John Bouker, the commercial pilot who first spotted the crash site, told CNN Thursday that Stevens' plane ""was messed up but not beyond survivability."" ""It looked survivable,"" Bouker said, ""but it didn't look like it would be a very fun ride or anything. The wings were bent back. The nose section was messed up. It didn't look like a good situation to be in, that's for sure."" The aircraft, which was taking the group on a fishing trip, crashed in an area near the Bering Sea noted for its rugged terrain. Tom Tucker, a helicopter pilot who landed at the crash site, told CNN that when he first arrived, the survivors ""were coming in and out of consciousness. We put blankets over them to keep them warm."" The longest-serving Republican senator in U.S. history, Stevens lost his 2008 re-election bid to then-Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich after being convicted on charges of making false statements on financial disclosure forms. A federal judge later dismissed the conviction, citing prosecutorial misconduct. Stevens survived a plane crash that killed his wife in 1978; he later remarried.

355,"(CNN) -- A 7.2-magnitude earthquake has struck south of the Mariana Islands, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Mariana Islands -- an archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean -- are made up of two U.S. territories, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The islands sit about three-quarters of the way from Hawaii to the Philippines. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center did not issue a tsunami warning after the quake, which struck at 7:19 a.m. Saturday (5:19 p.m. ET Friday). ""We wouldn't expect any kind of significant tsunami for this event,"" said the center's director, Charles McCreery, noting that the quake's magnitude was relatively low to provoke one. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage, emergency management officials said. The quake struck about 375 kilometers (233 miles) west-southwest of Hagatna, Guam, and 445 kilometers (276 miles) west-southwest of Rota, Northern Mariana Islands. It ran 4.7 kilometers (2.9 miles) deep. CNN's Dan Gilgoff and Talia Kayali contributed to this report.","NEW: No immediate reports of damage, casualties .

357,"(CNN) -- At least one member of the jury that sentenced Cameron Todd Willingham to death in the arson homicides of his three children says she is struggling with the idea that she might have convicted an innocent man. It has been 17 years since Willingham was convicted in Texas of setting a house fire that killed his children, a crime Willingham vehemently denied right up until his execution in 2004. Since that time, three investigations have concluded arson was not the likely cause of the 1991 fire, including one that arrived in Texas Gov. Rick Perry's office 88 minutes before the scheduled execution. Perry replaced four of nine members of the Texas Forensics Sciences Commission in recent weeks, just before the commission was to receive a report from the latest of the three investigations. The controversy has led juror Dorenda Brokofsky to think twice about the decision she made in a jury room in 1992. ""I don't sleep at night because of a lot of this,"" Brokofsky said. ""I have gone back and forth in my mind trying to think of anything that we missed. I don't like the fact that years later someone is saying maybe we made a mistake, that the facts aren't what they could've been."" Brokofsky spoke with CNN by phone from her Midwest home. She has long since moved away from tiny Corsicana, Texas, where the fire took place. ""I do have doubts now,"" she said. ""I mean, we can only go with what we knew at the time, but I don't like the fact now that maybe this man was executed by our word because of evidence that is not true. It may not be true now. And I don't like the fact that I may have to face my God and explain what I did."" ""When you're sitting there with all those facts, there was nothing else we could see,"" she said. ""Now I don't know. I can't tell you he's innocent, I can't say 100 percent he's guilty."" Brokofsky had another revelation. She said she thought she would be excluded from the jury because of her family's close relationship with key witness and then-Corsicana Assistant Fire Chief Douglas Fogg. Her father was also a fire marshal for eight years before the Willingham fire. ""I was raised with my father being a fire marshal,"" she said. ""He went around proving that stuff, so he wasn't here at that time. But I knew Doug Fogg, who was one of the witnesses. It was no secret, but I didn't think they would pick me as a juror because of it."" Critics say Perry's recent actions to shake up the commission were politically motivated, a charge he denies. Perry's office said it received a five-page fax on the day of the execution that contained an arson expert's findings that the fire was not deliberately set. It is unclear whether Perry read the fax. ""Given the brevity of the report and the general counsel's familiarity with all the other facts in the case, there was ample time for the general counsel to read and analyze the report and to brief the governor on its contents,"" Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle said. Willingham was executed less than two hours later. Death-penalty opponents say an impartial review of Willingham's case could lead to an unprecedented admission -- that the state executed an innocent man. The latest report concluded that the arson ruling at the heart of Willingham's conviction ""could not be sustained"" by modern science or the standards of the time. Perry said he remains confident Willingham was guilty, as do authorities in Corsicana, south of Dallas, who prosecuted Willingham. Willingham's wife's brother, Ronnie Kuykendall, said in a signed affidavit that Stacy Willingham told her family that Todd Willingham confessed to killing the children during her visit to him on death row a few days before the execution. But Stacy Willingham testified for her husband during his trial, while her family argued he was guilty. CNN could not reach her for comment. Even Willingham's defense attorney, David Martin, remains confident his client committed the crime. ""There was no question whatsoever that he was guilty,"" Martin said on CNN's ""AC360"" Thursday night. Martin slammed the most recent report on the Willing ham case, by Maryland arson expert Craig Beyler, as ""one of the least objective reports I've ever read."" On Thursday, Perry also lambasted the Beyler report as having ""a very politically driven agenda"" and being propaganda for the anti-death penalty movement. Beyler, asked about Perry's statements, said they were ""strange and clueless.""","Cameron Todd Willingham maintained his innocence up until his execution in 2004 .

358,"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- A remote-controlled roadside bomb ripped through a bus transporting Turkish military personnel and their families to a gendarmerie paramilitary base in Istanbul on Tuesday. Turkish authorities say three gendarmerie sergeants and the 17-year-old daughter of a member of the security forces were killed in the attack. A fourth wounded sergeant died in hospital hours after the bomb blast, an official at Istanbul's TEM Hospital told CNN, raising the death toll to five. ""It was a remote-controlled, fragmentation bomb that was left on the side of the road,"" said Huseyin Avni Mutlu, the governor of Istanbul, in a televised appearance broadcast live from the scene of the explosion. ""This is a terrorist act."" The bomb attack took place in the western, European side of the city. Mutlu said the device hit the third and last of a three-bus convoy that was traveling to the Istanbul Province Gendarmerie Command Center. CNN Turk, CNN's sister network, broadcast images of the white civilian passenger bus standing in the middle of the road, with purple curtains blowing through shattered windows. The network also showed video of a man dressed in civilian clothes bleeding from the stomach, being loaded into an ambulance. A splinter Kurdish nationalist group, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement posted on the internet. ""All military forces and groups, bureaucratic persons who have a role in this racist war against Kurdish people are our target,"" said the statement, which was released on the pro-Kurdish web-site, the Firat News Agency. The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons are a splinter group from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, a movement of Marxist Kurdish guerrillas who have been fighting against the Turkish state since the 1980s. Tuesday's deadly explosion comes at a time when the 26-year conflict between Turkish security forces and Kurdish PKK militants is once again flaring. Last week, a top Turkish army general announced the PKK was increasing the frequency of its attacks. General Fahri Kir said the militants are trying to expand operations beyond south-eastern, predominantly Kurdish-populated Turkey. PKK militants are making no secret of their threats to widen the battlefield in Turkey. ""If the military operations and the political operations do not stop against the guerrillas and the Kurdish people, the actions of the PKK will spread to the cities as well,"" said PKK spokesman Roj Welat, in a telephone call to CNN from northern Iraq. The PKK has been battling the Turkish government since the early 1980s. Initially, the movement fought to carve out a separate homeland for Turkey's ethnic Kurdish minority, which makes up nearly 18 percent of the Turkish population, according to the CIA World Factbook. More then 30,000 people, mostly ethnic Kurds, have been killed during the conflict.  In recent years, the rebels say they have given up their demands for an independent Kurdish state, and are instead fighting for more linguistic and cultural freedoms. Though the Kurds represent Turkey's largest ethnic minority, their language has historically been suppressed by the Turkish state, which long referred to Kurds as ""mountain Turks."" Twelve Turkish troops were killed in eastern Turkey last weekend during clashes with rebels along the border with Iraq. According to the Turkish military, at least 55 Turkish security forces have been killed in fighting with the PKK since the beginning of March. Turkish authorities said they were investigating links between Tuesday's roadside bomb and a similar, less deadly bombing that targeted a police bus in the same Halkali district of Istanbul on June 8. Fifteen police officers were injured in that attack. When asked about the previous police bus blast, Istanbul Police Chief Huseyin Capkin said there may be a connection. He added that authorities were investigating the possible link.","NEW: 5 killed in Istanbul bus bombing .

359,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suicide car bomber killed at least 56 people and wounded more than 100 others Friday when his vehicle exploded in a market in Mohmand Agency in Pakistan's tribal region, officials said. The intended target of the attack was a local government office in the town of Eakah. But the vehicle detonated in a market near the building, said Hayat Khan, a local administration official. About 20 shops, five houses and the local jail were damaged in the blast. In the confusion following the attack, various officials provided conflicting death tolls. Amjad Ali Khan, chief of Mohmand Agency, said four policemen were among the dead. Maqsood Mahed Khan, a local government official, said three children and two women were killed. Authorities also believe more victims may be trapped under the rubble of damaged buildings. Mohmand is one of seven semiautonomous tribal agencies along the 1,500-mile border porous border that Pakistan shares with Afghanistan. The Pakistani military has been battling insurgents in the area for some time.","More victims may be trapped under rubble .

360,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Desperation erupted into violence Tuesday in flood-ravaged Pakistan as survivors who have yet to receive aid scrambled to put food in their empty bellies. People in Sindh province blocked a highway to protest the slowness of aid delivery and clashed with police, the United Nations said. In a hard-hit district of Punjab, hungry mobs unloaded two aid trucks headed to a warehouse. Local aid agencies reported other incidents of looting. An aid agency worker said distributions were hampered because of the crowds stopping the convoys and because large numbers of people were living along the road. About 20 million people have been affected by the relentless monsoon rains that began falling three weeks ago, leading to massive flooding from the mountainous regions in the north to the river plains of the south. See high resoulution images of disaster . About one-fifth of Pakistan is submerged, and entire families waded through filthy water, pleading for help. More than 1,400 people have died. Health officials fear a second wave of fatalities from waterborne diseases, including cholera, which is endemic in Pakistan and now threatening to become a major outbreak. Up to 3.5 million children are at high risk of cholera and other deadly diseases like typhoid and dysentery, said Maurizio Giuliano of the United Nations' humanitarian affairs office. About 900,000 homes have been damaged, and the monsoon season is only about halfway over. Water is the villain here but can also be a savior: The only recourses from waterborne illnesses are clean water and medical care, but both are in short supply. The United Nations has called for $166 million for clean water and medical care but has received only $25 million. The World Bank has committed about $900 million at the request of the Pakistani government. According to a statement, funding will come from the bank's Fund for the Poorest through reprogramming of currently planned projects and reallocation of undisbursed funds from ongoing projects. The overall global response has not been nearly enough, according to an International Rescue Committee-chaired consortium called the Pakistan Humanitarian Forum. About $150 million had been received from nations around the world by Monday, the group said in a statement, but much more is needed. ""The international response to the disaster has been too small to even begin to effectively address the needs of survivors,"" said Tammy Hasselfeldt, the country director of the International Rescue Committee. ""The most urgent priority is to ensure that safe water as well as medicines are available, food supplies are restored and transportation networks fixed to accelerate the delivery of desperately needed aid."" The UN says $150 million is needed to feed up to 6 million Pakistanis, and $105 million is needed to help shelter about 2 million people left homeless. The United States has committed about $76 million for emergency flood relief assistance. But delivering the goods to flood victims is a nightmare in itself. With many roads and bridges reduced to rubble, travel by vehicles and foot is often impossible. The country is relying heavily on helicopters and boats to bring aid. ""We're putting the final pieces in place on a distribution system which can reach the huge number of people in need in the shortest possible time,"" said Wolfgang Herbinger, director of the United Nations' World Food Programme in Pakistan. ""It's a huge challenge, particularly in Sindh, where the delivery infrastructure is most constrained."" U.S. military helicopters delivered 2,500 pounds of relief supplies Tuesday and rescued 375 people. There are now 11 helicopters on the ground in Pakistan, but the Pentagon has ordered a total of 19 for flood relief efforts. Those efforts are costing the United States $300,000 a day, the Pentagon said. So far, $2.5 million has been spent. ""It's a dynamic situation,"" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said. ""But the U.S. is a good ally and a friend, and we want to be supportive."" Families continue to stomp through mud carrying whatever belongings they can salvage, passing dead livestock, with nowhere to go. Despite their suffering, many flood victims are reluctant to leave the ruins of their homes because they fear having their land stolen. Amid the devastation, a bit of good news surfaced: The head engineer of the Sukkur barrage -- a dam whose strength was questioned as flood waters rose in the Indus River -- said the dam is considered safe. The river crested August 10, and the dam withstood the pressure.

361,"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- At least 31 people were dead after two days of torrential rains triggered flash floods in northwestern Turkey, sweeping cars into the sea and sending gushing water into homes and businesses, authorities said Wednesday. A Turkish woman awaits rescuers on her balcony following heavy morning rain in Istanbul. Twenty-six people were killed in Istanbul province and five in neighboring Tekirdag province, according to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Nine people were feared missing, he said. Among the fatalities in Istanbul were seven female textile workers who were trapped in their minivan, CNN sister network CNN Turk reported. Witnesses in the city of Istanbul said the flash floods hit at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday, washing through an industrial zone situated in a low-lying valley. Dozens of cargo trucks flipped or were ripped to pieces, the wreckage attracting crowds who watched the chaotic scene from nearby hilltops.  See photos of the devastation » . At a news conference in Istanbul's Disaster Management Center, in front of walls of TVs showing live video feeds from Turkey's largest city, Erdogan expressed condolences to families that lost loved ones during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

He said emergency workers rescued an estimated 1,300 people from the flash floods and pledged billions of Turkish lira for disaster relief in Istanbul and Tekirdag provinces. He also chided developers who built commercial and residential structures in riverbeds that are vulnerable to flooding. ""Our ancestors had a saying: 'The river's revenge will be heavy,' "" Erdogan said. ""We should remember what our ancestors said."" In the wake of this week's disaster, the prime minister called for relocating all such settlements from riverbeds and moving them to safer ground. Several roads in Istanbul city remained closed, including the airport road, CNN Turk said. Rescue missions were in full swing, with military helicopters whirring overhead. Residents were advised not to wander from their homes. ""We never had such rain in all the time I have been here,"" said Zafer Ercan, deputy mayor of the town of Silivri, an hour west of Istanbul city. View images from iReporters .

364,"(CNN) -- Satellite photographs on NASA's website show hundreds of hot spots generated by wildfires across central and western Russia. State media reported that the images showed 368 hot spots across Russia on Saturday. RIA Novosti quoted a spokeswoman for ScanEx, which analyzes the images, as saying that central Russia's Moscow, Ryazan and Nizhny Novgorod regions are the most affected. Smoke clouds, which have become a serious health hazard, can clearly been seen on the satellite images, blanketing large swaths of the country. State media reported that carbon monoxide levels in Moscow were more than six times the maximum allowable concentration, and other toxic substances permeated the city air at nine times the normal level. The disaster has killed more than 50 people and left dozens hospitalized, according to Russia's health and social development ministry. Meanwhile, Russia thanked the United States for coming to its aid. ""Russia is grateful to the United States over the assistance in tackling the wildfires raging across the country,"" said the Russian Foreign Ministry, according to news reports. The United States sent some $4.5 million in aid that included water tanks, pumps, hand tools, fire-protective clothing and medical kits, according to the U.S. State Department.

366,"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A fighter jet crashed in southern Afghanistan on Monday, in the fourth wreck in three days, authorities said. A French Air Force Mirage 2000 sits under a shelter on the tarmac at an airbase in Kandahar on January 1, 2009. Authorities were looking into why the plane went down during takeoff from Kandahar airfield Monday morning, but the role of insurgents had been ruled out, said Lt. Col. Paul Kolken, the spokesman at the airfield. The crew ejected safely, and was being treated, Kolken said. Five hours after the crash, the wreckage of the plane was still on fire. Military officials did not identify the type of jet that crashed, nor did they release the nationality of the crew. Weather conditions were fair at the time of the incident, Kolken said.

367,"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Hundreds of runners braved their luck Wednesday on the first day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona -- but just two men, an Australian and a Spaniard, were taken to hospital afterward with injuries, the Navarra regional government said. It was considered a thrilling but safe start to the annual tradition in Pamplona, which has tallied 14 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924, including the fatal goring of a Spanish man last year, and thousands of injuries. The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title ""Fiesta."" It is now broadcast live across Spain by state television TVE, which estimated there were more than a thousand runners. An 18-year-old Australian man from Melbourne was taken to hospital with various injuries sustained on the narrow street that descends into the bullring. And a Spanish man, 20, from Zaragoza also went to hospital with an eye injury sustained on a street almost halfway through the run, the Navarra regional government said on its website. Both were initially listed in stable condition but under close observation, the website said. It took the six bulls and a pack of tame steers, which help guide the bulls, a full 17 seconds to emerge from the corrals after the opening rocket was fired to signal the start of the run. But the pack then moved swiftly through the cobblestone streets of old Pamplona along the 825-meter (902-yard) course to the bullring, where the bulls will die later in the day in a bullfight. The run lasted just 2 minutes and 23 seconds and the bull and steer pack stayed mainly together, which long-time observers say usually means a safer run -- unlike when a bull or bulls get separated, frightened and may charge directly into the runners. Television images showed mostly men dressed in the traditional white outfits with red handkerchiefs, but also a small number of women, and even one man with a football helmet, which is prohibited but was apparently not noticed by the hundreds of police officers who eject, before the run, people carrying cameras or who are drunk. The aim is safety, so that runners can focus on the run. Television images showed numerous runners making hard falls to the pavement, tripping over other runners or colliding with the bulls. The daily run continues for eight days, through July 14, at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET), and is the highlight of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona that attracts hundreds of thousands to the non-stop fiesta.","1 Austrialian, 1 Spaniard taken to hospital .

369,"(CNN) -- Four days after an al Qaeda-linked group claimed responsibility for targeting an oil tanker, the United Arab Emirates government has acknowledged that it was indeed attacked, state media said Friday. The government had earlier said the tanker was passing through the Strait of Hormuz when it was exposed to a high wave as a result of an earthquake shock. However, the state news agency WAM reported, the tanker ""was the target of a terrorist attack while passing through international waters near the Strait of Hormuz."" Workers fixed the damage to the vessel and the attack caused no human injuries or oil spills, the agency said. The militant Islamist group claimed responsibility for the explosion aboard the oil tanker on Monday. In a statement posted on various websites that regularly carry messages from al Qaeda leaders, the Abdullah Azzam Brigades included a picture of a man they claimed carried out a suicide attack on the tanker on July 28. The group said the attack was intended to ""strike an economic blow to the infidels."" It is believed to be behind several attacks in the Middle East, including the October 2004 attack on a hotel and nearby camp sites in Egypt that killed more than three dozen people. The statement from the Abdullah Azzam Brigades said the attack on the tanker was the ""conquest of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman"" -- a reference to the imprisoned blind cleric who inspired the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York.","State agency says attack was terror-related .

370,"New York (CNN) -- Amtrak Northeast Corridor service between New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, continued to be affected by ongoing signal problems Wednesday in New Jersey, Amtrak said in a 10 a.m. statement. In addition, while New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor service improved as the morning progressed, the line was still suffering delays into the afternoon, the railroad's website said in a 12:24 p.m. update. The outage was caused by a downed tree that fell into the overhead wire system near Hamilton, New Jersey, Amtrak said. As a result, Amtrak trains were moving at greatly reduced speeds, with some trains canceled due to associated congestion. Amtrak said its personnel were working to repair the problem, but passengers should expect westbound/southbound delays of 90 to 120 minutes and 60 to 90 minute eastbound/northbound delays. No trains were stranded between stations, and passengers were being re-accommodated on other trains where available, Amtrak said. Amtrak spokesman Cliff Cole couldn't say how long trains would be traveling with reduced speed and frequency before service would be completely restored. New Jersey Transit Northeast Corridor service between New Brunswick, New Jersey, and New York was back on schedule or close to on schedule in both directions, according to the transit website. However, 30- to 45-minute delays plagued the Northeast Corridor line into the afternoon because of signal problems, the website said. Service was suspended most of the morning in both directions between Trenton, New Jersey, and New Brunswick, because of the signal problems. Passengers were advised to get on the 11:17 a.m. train departing from Trenton. Transit and suburban buses were accepting rail tickets and passes for fares Wednesday morning, the website said.

371,"(CNN) -- The bodies of two children trapped inside a car submerged in the Edisto River in South Carolina have been recovered, and their mother has been arrested, authorities said Monday. State troopers responded to a report of a car accident early Monday and found a Chrysler sedan in the water near a boat landing in Orangeburg County. Divers discovered the bodies of the two boys, ages 1 and 2, which were taken from the car and sent to the county coroner for autopsies, authorities said. Their mother is 29-year-old Shaquan Duley, Sheriff Larry Williams told HLN's Nancy Grace. She was arrested and charged with leaving the scene of an accident. Williams said the boys' mother walked almost a mile before calling for help. While the woman described the incident as an accident, Williams told CNN that ""it has a stench of foul play."" It wasn't immediately known whether Duley had retained an attorney. Williams said he couldn't confirm reports that the key was still in the car's ignition, but he said the car apparently was in neutral. He added Duley didn't appear wet, saying, ""She didn't have any evidence that she had been submerged in the water."" The car went off a boat ramp that is about 10 yards off the roadway shoulder and sits at a 90-degree angle. ""She said she was going down road and lost control of vehicle and happened to be at juncture where boat ramp was,"" Williams told Grace. However, he added, ""There's no evidence that she ran off the road at any time."" The woman says she flagged a motorist down to use a cell phone to call in the incident, Williams said. Police are trying to track down that individual. Duley was questioned ""on and off"" Monday afternoon and expected to be booked at the jail sometime in the evening, the sheriff said earlier in the day. The boys' father, who doesn't live at the same residence as the children, has been interviewed by investigators, Williams said. The sheriff said he didn't know the father's whereabouts at the time of the incident. Duley has a third child, a 5-year-old daughter, who was at the home of her maternal grandmother where they all lived, he said.

372,"(CNN) -- The youngest survivor of a plane crash that killed former Sen. Ted Stevens last week has been released from a hospital in Alaska, according to his family. Willy Phillips Jr., 13, was released from Children's Hospital at Providence Alaska Medical Center and is traveling back to his home state of Maryland, his mother said in a statement Saturday. Willy's father, former Stevens staffer Bill Phillips, was among the five people killed in the crash Monday night near Dillingham, Alaska. In the statement, Janet Phillips thanked first-responders and other medical personnel ""for their heroic efforts the night they spent on the mountain with Willy. Thank you for bringing Willy back."" Phillips also extended her condolences to the other families who lost loved ones in the wreck. ""Bill and our boys shared many Alaska memories,"" Phillips said in the statement. ""They loved Alaska, and as we leave we know Alaska will remain imprinted on our hearts."" In addition to Willy, the survivors of the crash are former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe and his 19-year-old son, Kevin, and Jim Moorhard of Alexandria, Virginia. Killed in the crash were Bill Phillips Sr., Stevens, 86; pilot Terry Smith, 62, of Eagle River, Alaska; Dana Tindall, 48, of Anchorage, Alaska; and Corey Tindall, 16, of Anchorage, Alaska. A memorial service for the elder Phillips will be held Friday in Potomac, Maryland, according to the statement. Meanwhile, federal investigators continue to probe what caused the plane to crash into a rugged mountainside in southwestern Alaska, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Alaska Air National Guard rescuers were hampered by poor weather and terrain -- slogging for hours through rain, fog and wind to reach the site of the plane crash. Autopsies on the five victims found the deaths were the result of blunt force trauma, Greg Wilkinson, an official at the medical examiner's office, said Friday. He said the state medical examiner, Dr. Katherine Raven, found the injuries to be consistent with this type of crash. Raven also found that the injuries were not survivable, he said. A funeral for Stevens, who served in the U.S. Senate for 40 years, will be held Wednesday at the Anchorage Baptist Temple in Anchorage.","Willy Phillips Jr. was among four survivors of the crash .

373,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The rescue and recovery efforts of the Pakistan floods that have killed more than 800 could become more complicated as weather officials predict more monsoon rains starting Monday. The Pakistan Meteorological Department said Sindh, Punjab, Kashmir, eastern parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and eastern parts of Balochistan would receive monsoon rains. Areas along the Indus River would be badly affected due to extremely high flood conditions. The death toll from the flooding has risen to at least 800, the information minister of a northern province said Saturday. The number reflects those killed only in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, previously known as the North West Frontier Province, said spokesman Mian Iftikhar Hussain. Flooding has also been reported in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. Twenty-five deaths were recorded there Friday, Hussain said. The United Nations says the number of people affected by the floods has risen to nearly 1 million people, with infrastructure receiving major damage. Rushing water also has washed away thousands of acres of crops, government buildings, businesses, schools, bridges and homes, officials said. The United States will assist in relief efforts by bringing in 50,000 meals, rescue boats and helicopters, 12 pre-fabricated steel bridges and water filtration units, the embassy in Islamabad said. According to Geo TV, 150 people are missing in a northwestern province and 3,700 homes were swept away. Forty-seven bridges in Sawat have been destroyed or damaged. Geo TV also said 3,000 are in a camp in Nowshera and are without enough water and food. Displaced residents are unhappy with the government response, Geo TV said. Trains have also been delayed, frustrating commuters. ""They have made this a joke,"" a commuter told the network. ""There are young children here but there is no water, nor is there any seating, they have taken our ticket money yet after every few minutes they change the train timings. They are playing a game of lies and deceit."" Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik visited Kyhber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday and found tourists and local residents trapped because of the heavy floods, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported. President Asif Ali Zardari said all available resources would be used to help those stranded by the waters, the APP reported. Many of the victims died when floodwaters swept away hundreds of mud houses in parts of Swat Valley and the districts of Shangla and Tank, according to Bashir Ahmed Bilour, a provincial minister in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Hussain said flooding has cut off the Swat Valley and the districts of Shangla and Peshawar. There is no way to get to these areas by road, he said. The Pakistani Air Force has been helping with rescue efforts, spokesman Tariq Yazdanie said in an interview on Pakistani TV. The recent torrential rains have broken all previous records of rainfall in the country, he said. The United Nations said there is a need for help in providing emergency shelter, food, drinking water and sanitation facilities. Its agencies are geared to help with these issues. The European Commission is providing 30 million euros ($39 million) to help the people affected by the flooding. ""Pakistan has been hit by terrible floods and more rain is forecast. Our thoughts are with those affected by them,"" said Kristalina Georgieva, European commissioner for international Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response. ""I am pleased that our decision to provide new humanitarian funding for the most vulnerable people in Pakistan will also be able to benefit the people, who have suffered from this disaster."" According to a Pentagon official with knowledge of the operations, the U.S. is assisting with the delivery of meals to the affected region. A C-130 carrying 12,000 Halal meals (MREs but tailored for people of Islamic faith) was on its way to Pakistan on Saturday. By Saturday afternoon another 45,000 meals were to be delivered. Officials promised further assistance efforts in the coming days. CNN's Reza Sayah and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Displaced residents are unhappy with government response .

374,"(CNN) -- The boy stood out because of the bright blue shirt he was wearing, not for his arms stretched toward the heavens or the look in his eyes that said: I am hungry. All the other boys were desperate, too. Photographer Paula Bronstein looked down at them from the Pakistani military helicopter about to drop food and water. She would never know their names but she would tell their story. Click. click. click. The boy in the blue shirt is one of 20 million Pakistanis suffering in a land washed away by massive monsoon flooding. Aid workers say that media coverage of a disaster helps bring in donations. Bronstein, working for Getty Images, and other photographers are attempting to unveil the unfathomable scope of Pakistan's human misery. Three weeks into the crisis, thousands of homeless packed into makeshift, fly-infested camps. They endured the searing summer heat and the ache of their empty bellies. They wondered, with more rain on the way, when they might see home again. If ever. Some voiced frustration that aid had not reached them. Others were downright angry at their own government for perceived failure in a time of national need. Much of the criticism has been pointed at President Asif Ali Zardari, who was in Europe as the crisis unfolded and was late visiting flood zones. Zardari again left Pakistan Wednesday, arriving in the Russian town of Sochi to participate in a four-nation summit with Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Russia, according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan. Zardari's office has defended the president's travels as part of his job and called the criticism ""venomous propaganda of his opponents."" But one thing is clear: Zardari, leader of a country already coping with poverty and violence, will have to deal with far-reaching consequences of the floods. The United Nations has received less than half of the $460 million it needs for relief efforts. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's office said she would announce more aid Thursday on top of the roughly $70 million already pledged by Washington. No one knows exactly why the flow of aid money is failing to keep up with the need, though Bronstein, interviewed Wednesday on CNN, suspected one reason might be the death toll. At just over 1,400, it is low given the scale of the disaster. ""What usually takes people's breath away is the sheer number of people who die,"" she said. ""But this is a different kind of disaster."" It has been evolving and people's suffering increased incrementally along with the water that spread from the mountains in the north to the plains of the south. Aid workers have also said it has been hard to reach people because of continuing rain and damaged or flooded bridges and roads. In villages and towns where they were able to get through, people raced trucks carrying relief. Only the young boys, like the one with the blue shirt, had the energy to keep up, it seemed to Bronstein. From the back of an aid truck all she could see were a mess of tangled arms forced through open windows. Others grabbed onto chunks of ice distributed by a local charity. Another photo showed a woman in a black and pink dupatta (scarf). Her left hand hugged her cheek in despair, her eyes failed to meet the camera's lens. Bronstein snapped a perfect portrait of uncertainty. ""When you are here, you see how little people have,"" Bronstein said. ""The poorest people have been affected."" Even when the rescue choppers land or the boats arrived, many Pakistanis were reluctant to leave home. They depended on the land and their animals to make a living. They already lost their crops. If they left their livestock behind, they would be leaving with nothing. How would they restart life? But it was only from the air, said Bronstein, that she could see what it meant for one-fifth of the country to be underwater. A group of people stood on an island of dry, dusty ground with a handful of ramshackle shelters. They were surrounded by water, water and more water. The helicopter hovered before dropping bags of flour and 10-packs of bottled water. A man on a rooftop thrashed his arms about for attention. No one can afford to be forgotten, to be left behind or left without. Bronstein pointed her camera toward people who have nothing. The world, she felt, needed to see.

375,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who remade Heidi Montag died when his Jeep plunged off a Malibu highway into the ocean Monday, a California Highway Patrol spokesman said. Dr. Frank Ryan, 50, had just finished hiking with his border collie on a giant sand dune along the Pacific Coast Highway when the crash happened, according to his own Twitter message posted minutes earlier. ""The Jeep veered to the right and ran off the roadway,"" Officer Steven Reid said. ""The Jeep overturned down a rocky embankment towards the ocean and eventually came to rest on its roof."" The dog was seriously injured, Reid said. It was taken to a veterinary hospital for treatment. ""He was the most amazing person I have ever known,"" reality TV star Montag said in tweets posted Tuesday morning. ""He was an angel and changed my life and the lives of everyone he met."" Ryan defended the 10 cosmetic surgery procedures he performed on Montag as a ""very well-thought out, calculated career move."" ""Celebrities in the public eye need to look good,"" Ryan told HLN's ""Showbiz Tonight."" ""That's all there is to it."" The list of procedures Ryan did on Montag, a star of MTV's ""The Hills,"" included breast implants, a nose job, Botox in her forehead, a brow lift, fat injections in her cheeks, a chin reduction and liposuction. ""No one needs elective cosmetic surgery; that is something that they desire,"" Ryan said. ""That is what Heidi desired.""","Highway patrol says surgeon died when his Jeep plunged down embankment .

376,"St. Petersburg, Florida (CNN) -- Oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill may have settled to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico further east than previously suspected and at levels toxic to marine life, researchers reported Monday. Initial findings from a new survey of the Gulf conclude that dispersants may have sent the oil to the ocean floor, where it has turned up at the bottom of an undersea canyon within 40 miles of the Florida Panhandle. Plankton and other organisms showed a ""strong toxic response"" to the crude, according to researchers from the University of South Florida. ""The dispersant is moving the oil down out of the surface and into the deeper waters, where it can affect phytoplankton and other marine life,"" said John Paul, a marine microbiologist at USF. Results of the latest survey are scheduled to be released Tuesday, but CNN obtained a summary of the initial conclusions Monday night. Tests conducted offshore indicate the oil matches the 205-million-gallon Deepwater Horizon spill, which has been temporarily capped for a month, the summary states. Some of it has spread into the DeSoto Canyon, a channel on the ocean floor east of the ruptured well. That canyon comprises part of the spawning grounds for much of the Gulf's commercial fish. ""To date, this is the easternmost location for the occurrence of subsurface oils,"" the report states. The oil is not ""draping"" across the bottom, but is spread out in ""small, unevenly distributed droplets,"" the report states. USF chemical oceanographer David Hollander said that when an ultraviolet light used to detect oil was turned onto the sea floor, ""All of a sudden, it turns out to be a constellation of little dots."" And the oil could well up onto the continental shelf and resurface later, Paul said. Or it could be eaten by fish and other animals and accumulate in the food chain, Hollander said. ""It's in such small droplets that you can see it -- you can filter it and see it,"" he said. ""But if you look at it, it's transparent, and small larval fish see these droplets as food so they're ingesting pure oil."" The Environmental Protection Agency has previously reported some oil turning up in the sediment at the bottom of the Gulf, but has not determined whether it came from the Deepwater Horizon spill that erupted in April or whether it was already present. And on August 4, the head of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration warned that oil could persist in the water even though the well has been temporarily capped. The oil company BP used more than 1.8 million gallons of chemical dispersants on the Deepwater Horizon spill between its eruption in late April and the time the well was capped in mid-July. BP says the chemicals allowed the oil to be broken up into droplets small enough that microbes can digest it, and the Environmental Protection Agency has said the dispersants were no more toxic than the oil itself. Critics warned the full effect of the dispersants on the food chain was not known and that their use in deep water effectively concealed the full extent of the spill. NOAA spokeswoman Mary Jane Schramm said on Monday that she had not seen the latest study and couldn't comment on it. BP spokesman John Curry, meanwhile, said the company wants ""to know everything everyone wants to know."" The company is responsible for capping, cleaning up and compensating victims of the oil spill, and it has committed to spending $500 million to research the spill's impact over the next 10 years. The latest study will ""add another piece to the puzzle,"" Curry said. ""There will be others that'll want to look at this study and want to look at doing some additional research,"" he said. ""There's been extensive testing up to this point, and I'm sure there will be much more going forward.""

377,"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations estimates more than a billion dollars damage from the Pakistan flooding. In a phone conference to reporters in New York Friday, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Pakistan said the cost to rebuild the affected parts of the country ""has to be measured in terms of hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more than a billion."" Martin Mogwanja, the UN's coordinator in Islamabad, Pakistan, said, ""There is going to be a tremendous cost in terms of repairing roads, bridges, telecommunications and electricity infrastructure,"" and most importantly, the farming and irrigation infrastructure. The United Nations is preparing an initial flood emergency response plan to address the immediate needs of Pakistan and the affected population, he said. Mogwanja said the response will cover 90 days initially and ""will address the most pressing needs in the area of food security, health care, sanitation and shelter."" The U.N. plan and a flash appeal for funding will be introduced to the international community in the near future, he said. ""An estimated 1,400 people have been killed by the flood waters so far, but this number may rise as new bodies may be found,"" said Mogwanja. The terrain is so waterlogged that many families can't bury their loved ones at traditional burial grounds. Some people are traveling to higher ground to conduct burials, and others are waiting for family members and the appropriate time, Mogwanja said. ""It is indeed, a very, very sad occasion,"" he said. ""More than 250,000 homes have been badly damaged or destroyed, leaving at least 1.5 million people homeless,"" said Mogwanja. To help combat homelessness, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has provided more than 11,000 tents. Pakistan has reported that at least 12 million people are affected by the flood but Mogwanja said only 4 million have been affected and that the estimate could rise. ""These estimates that we are providing are based upon the figures that we are receiving from the disaster management authorities in different provinces,"" Mogwanja said. He said monsoon season could last two to four weeks and that the United Nations and its partners have been providing emergency assistance since the start of the flood. The priorities which have been provided for so far include: 500 metric tons of food from the World Food Programme, clean drinking water from UNICEF to more than 700,000 people, and 40 cholera kits from the World Health Organization to health centers in Pakistan. ""However, this is only a small fraction of what is required, given the scale of this disaster and also its geographic scope, spreading across the poor, large provinces of the country,"" Mogwanja said.","U.N. estimates more than a billion dollars damage from the Pakistan flooding .

379,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Federal officials Thursday barred the promoters of last week's deadly off-road race in Southern California from holding future races on public land while an investigation is under way. Saturday night's crash in the desert east of Los Angeles left eight people dead and nine injured when a truck taking part in the 200-mile event crashed into a crowd of spectators along the track. The driver won't face charges in the accident, the California Highway Patrol announced Monday, but the federal Bureau of Land Management is investigating whether sanctioning body Mojave Desert Racing violated any safety regulations. According to its permit, Mojave Desert Racing had five more races scheduled for 2010. The company has not responded to repeated calls for comment since Saturday's fatal crash. ""BLM has suspended any future permitted events of MDR Productions while the investigation is underway,"" the agency announced Thursday. In addition, another promoter's upcoming motorcycle race is under new scrutiny, and future events ""are being reviewed on a case-by-case basis,"" BLM said in a written statement. The agency said that off-highway races are a popular activity and that its investigation ""will be aimed at ensuring the public safety remains our first priority."" Last weekend's race was part of an amateur series on a course in the Lucerne Valley area of San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles. Mojave Desert Racing urges spectators to stay back 100 feet from the 50-mile course, but a California Highway Patrol spokesman said there were ""no delineations"" for the course. Images from the night of the crash show trucks speeding within feet of spectators. Brett Sloppy, the driver of the out-of-control truck, did not respond to repeated requests for comment but announced in a post on his Facebook page that he was devastated by what happened. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to all the familys and friends involved,"" he wrote. ""Thank you too all my friends for sticking with me even thru these tragic times I love you all."" Keith Carty, a friend of one of the victims in the California crash, told CNN's HLN that races attract a certain type of person: someone who wants to participate as much as watch an event. ""It's not anybody's turn to baby-sit us. We're out there. We understand the risk. Everybody that was there understood the risk: the drivers, the spectators, everybody,"" he said.

380,"(CNN) -- Residents in Seattle, Washington, were shaken Tuesday afternoon by what sounded like explosions after two F-15s were dispatched in response to a report of a small plane that entered restricted airspace where President Barack Obama was campaigning for Sen. Patty Murray. The rumblings -- caused by sonic booms from the jets -- rattled buildings, windows and nerves in the Puget Sound region, according to CNN affiliate KIRO. Viewers of the affiliate from as far away as Tacoma -- about 40 miles south of Seattle -- reported hearing the booms. Dozens of residents called the city's 911 system, causing it to shut down in some areas for about an hour due to the flood of calls, Ed Troyer, a spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff's Department told KIRO. ""Many house and car alarms have been set off that we will not be able to respond to,"" Troyer told the affiliate. The jets were launched out of Portland, Oregon, and ""were on afterburners the whole time,"" Allen Kenitzer of the Federal Aviation Administration told CNN. The plane in question -- identified by the FAA as a Cessna 180 -- left the temporarily restricted airspace before the jets intercepted it, said John Cornelio of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The pilot of the plane later landed it near Lake Washington, Kenitzer said. The incident is under investigation.

383,"(CNN) -- A 20-year-old man waiting in line for a ride at Disney's California Adventure Park fell 25 to 30 feet Wednesday night, Anaheim police spokesman Sgt. Rick Martinez said Thursday. The man was in the building housing the queue for the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, when he put his leg over the railing and fell, Martinez said. ""The guest was standing in line with friends on a second-floor platform when he climbed over a barrier to the area below and lost his balance and fell approximately 25 feet,"" Disneyland spokeswoman Suzi Brown said in a statement. Paramedics on site treated the man, Martinez said. A dispatcher for Metro Cities Fire Authority, which serves seven Orange County cities, said the man was brought to University of California Irvine Medical Center. ""The guest was transported by ambulance to the hospital. We understand his injuries were minor and he has been treated and released,"" Brown said. The incident happened around 10:30 p.m., the Metro Cities dispatcher said.

384,"PUERTO MONTT, Chile (CNN) -- Nearly a week after a volcano erupted in Chaiten, Chile, disgorging its contents across a wide area of the Andes Mountains, authorities finished evacuating the area most affected. Though the eruption has been continuous, it increased at midnight Wednesday, powered by a massive explosion, then returned to its steady discharge of ash, officials said. Overnight, authorities armed with a court order evacuated the last of the holdouts -- many of whom had sought to remain to care for their cattle -- among the approximately 5,000 residents inside the 30-kilometer (18-mile) exclusion zone, said Carmen Fernandez, director of Chile's Office of Emergency. By Thursday morning, about 100 people -- primarily police, military and journalists -- remained in the immediate vicinity of the volcano, she said. In Bariloche, 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the volcano, Chilean Minister of Defense Jose Goni met Thursday with Argentine Vice President Julio Cobos to coordinate the transfer of the cows in the affected zone to Argentine territory, 60 kilometers (37 miles) away. Many of Bariloche's residents clutched handkerchiefs to their faces or wore cloth masks -- handed out by the government -- as they went about their business. Even with the masks, breathing could be difficult. Thick layers of ash covered everything like freshly fallen snow. Bariloche's airport and other regional airports were shut Thursday after satellite photos revealed that the air over the provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Rio Negro, Neuquen and Chubut was filled with ash. The most dense clouds of the material were seen over Chubut and Rio Negro, with lesser amounts in the other provinces. In all, clouds of ash covered nearly a third of Argentina, the country's meteorological service said. As of noon Thursday, ash could be seen in the sky above Buenos Aires and its suburbs, it said. ""The sky appears gray, products of the presence of ashes that are moving from west to east at an altitude of about 3,500 meters,"" the service said.  Watch volcano eruption » . ""Fortunately, the composition of the ash, air and smoke that is coming out of the volcano isn't highly toxic,"" said Mirta Roses, director of the Pan American Health Organization. But, she said, children, older people and people with allergies or asthma are at highest risk and should make extra efforts to avoid it. Many of the evacuees were taken to Puerto Montt, a port city in southern Chile about 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Chaiten. The volcano, which is about 1210 kilometers (752 miles) south of the Chilean capital, Santiago, began erupting early Friday, raining gray ash onto Chaiten. The small city is on the Corcovado Gulf, in southern Chile. The volcano last erupted around 7,420 B.C., according to the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Project. Chile contains a large number of active volcanoes, including Llaima, which erupted in January, sending lava and smoke down a snow-covered mountain.

385,"(CNN) -- Lava and ash from Ecuador's Tungurahua volcano forced the closure of Guayaquil Airport until Saturday afternoon, an airport spokesman said Friday. The glacier-capped, 16,478-foot (5,023-meter) volcano has erupted periodically since 1999, with major eruptions occurring in August 2006 and February 2008, the government's emergency management agency said. Officials evacuated the towns of Cusua and Juive Grande in central Ecuador, the emergency agency said, but no injuries or fatalities had been reported. No further evacuations were planned, the agency said. Death toll climbs from Guatemala eruption . The eruption sent a large ash cloud into the air, the Geophysical Institute of Peru said. The height could not be determined because of cloudiness in the area. Are you in Ecuador? Share your volcanic activity images . Before the long-term eruption beginning in 1999 that caused the temporary evacuation of the city of Banos at the foot of the volcano, the last major eruption had occurred from 1916 to 1918, and minor activity continued until 1925, the Smithsonian Institution said on its volcano Web site. The volcano is 87 miles (140 km) south of Quito, the nation's capital. Tungurahua means ""throat of fire"" in the native Quechua language. It was the second volcanic eruption reported in Latin America in the past few days.

Shaelyn Wilson had gone to see runoff from a flash flood around 2 p.m., according to the Coconino Sheriff's Department. A younger sister ran back to tell the father that Shaelyn had fallen into a wash. The family searched the area near where the girl fell and several agencies also took part in the search, according to Kelli Most, administrative specialist with the sheriff's department. The girl was found about a third of a mile from where she went into the water, and her father performed CPR until paramedics arrived. She was pronounced dead at Flagstaff Medical Center. A massive wildfire last month made the area susceptible to flooding, said Most. ""There's just no greenery there"" to prevent runoff, she said. The blaze charred 15,000 acres.

387,"(CNN) -- Frigid temperatures threatened Florida citrus crops as much of the Southeast into plunged into the teens Monday morning. State capital Tallahassee had plunged to 16 degrees by 5:25 a.m. ET, while temperatures in the 30s or below could be found well south of Orlando. The cold made Florida cities like Winter Haven anything but. The National Weather Service issued a hard freeze warning that extended as far south as Lake Okeechobee. Normally immune to the cold of winter, temperatures in Miami barely got into the 40s on Sunday; normally, they'd be in the 70s. Share your cold weather stories, photos . But the biggest news about the big chill is coming from the northern part of Florida, where a hard freeze watch is in effect, CNN's meteorologist Bonnie Schneider said. That could be bad news for citrus trees that rarely survive when temperatures remain in the mid-20s or below for four hours or longer, according to Kristen Gunter, a spokeswoman for the association of companies that pick and process the oranges. Some groves in the northern part of the growing area sustained substantial damage Saturday night and Sunday morning, when temperatures dipped to 28 degrees or lower for at least six hours, said Andrew Meadows, spokesman for Florida Citrus Mutual, a group representing about 8,000 citrus growers in the state. It will take about five weeks to quantify the losses, he said. Florida citrus is a $9.3 billion industry. The state produces three-quarters of the United States' orange crop and 40 percent of the world's orange juice supply. ""[Sunday night] will be the night to watch, because if things don't go well, the entire economy will be affected, jobs could be lost if fruit on the ground cannot be harvested, workers will go elsewhere in the U.S., and Florida will lose,"" Gunter said. The citrus harvest is at its peak right now, she said, and workers are already grinding away seven days a week as it is. ""I'm not sure we can work any faster,"" Gunter said.","Temperature in Tallahassee drops to 18 on Monday morning .

388,"(CNN) -- A body found near where a California teen vanished last week on her way home from summer school was confirmed Wednesday to be that of 17-year-old Norma Lopez, a Riverside County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. The identification was made through dental records, according to Sgt. Joe Barja. Authorities are now treating the case as a homicide investigation, and are searching for any witnesses or information leading to a suspect. Barja declined to reveal the cause of death or reveal any injuries Lopez may have sustained. Lopez was last seen Thursday leaving summer class at Valley View High School in Moreno Valley, about 70 miles east of Los Angeles. She had planned to meet her younger sister and a friend at home. It is believed Lopez, who would have been a senior in the fall, took a short cut through a dirt field to reach the family's residence. Her sister contacted the police when Lopez never returned home. The body was discovered around 3 p.m. Tuesday, said Deputy Melissa Nieburger of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. Nieburger said the body was found about two miles from where Lopez vanished. Police are looking for a green ""SUV type vehicle"" that was seen driving away from the area at the time of Lopez's disappearance.

389,"Washington (CNN) -- The companies that have recalled more than half a billion eggs following a salmonella outbreak fell short of safety standards at their farms, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said Sunday. ""There's no question these farms involved in the recall were not operating with the standards of practice we consider responsible,"" Hamburg told CNN. She said ""about 1,000"" people have been sickened by a salmonella outbreak that federal regulators have traced back to two Iowa egg producers. One of those companies said Sunday it is ""devastated"" by the possible connection between its product and salmonella. Hillandale Farms of Iowa announced Friday it was recalling more than 170 million eggs. Another 380 million have been recalled by another Iowa producer, Wright County Egg, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration linked the eggs to an outbreak of salmonella that has sickened hundreds of people nationwide. ""We are devastated that our eggs have been implicated in making people sick,"" Hillandale Farms, one of the largest U.S. producers, said in a statement issued Sunday. ""We have never had a product recall in our 45-year history, and it flies in the face of our mission to provide wholesome, nutritious food for the American public. We regret that anyone might have become ill, and the concern and disruption this has caused our customers."" The eggs were shipped to 17 states across the country. The company said it would work with the FDA to review its ""every phase of our operation"" and fix any problems. Hillandale Farms said it shared ""a number of common suppliers"" with Wright County Egg, including a company called Quality Egg, which provided feed and young birds. Both Wright County and Quality Egg are owned by the DeCoster family, which has a string of agribusiness interests in the Midwest and Northeast. Those companies' records have come under new scrutiny since the recalls were announced earlier this month. In June, company owner Jack DeCoster admitted to 10 civil counts of animal cruelty in Maine after a nonprofit animal welfare group conducted an undercover video investigation and forwarded its findings to Maine animal welfare officials. Dr. Donald E. Hoenig, the Maine state veterinarian, said the allegations included keeping too many birds in case, failing to treat injured chickens or promptly remove dead animals and improper euthanization. Hoenig said DeCoster and his company agreed to a $25,000 fine and made a $100,000 payment to reimburse the state for future monitoring of the facility. In 1996, the Labor Department accused DeCoster of maintaining ""sweatshop conditions"" for migrant workers at its Turner, Maine, chicken farm, where then-Labor Secretary Robert Reich said workers risked salmonella by handling dead chickens and manure with their bare hands. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined it $3.6 million. In January 2002, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission hit another DeCoster company with allegations that its supervisors sexually assaulted and harassed female employees, including some of whom were in the country illegally, and threatened to retaliate against them if they complained. The managers were fired for ""unrelated reasons,"" the EEOC said, and DeCoster agreed to pay a settlement of more than $1.5 million. And in 2000, Iowa's attorney general declared DeCoster a ""habitual violator"" of state environmental laws after a series of discharges of manure from his hog-farming operations. He paid a $150,000 penalty, had to build six concrete storage structures and his company was barred from expanding those operations. In a statement issued Sunday night, Wright County Egg said it was working with the FDA on the current recalls and defended its record. ""When issues have been raised about our farms, our management team has addressed them swiftly and effectively, working with recognized outside experts to identify and establish corrective measures for our operations,"" it said. ""We are approaching our work with FDA in the same forthright manner."" While the recall involves hundreds of millions of eggs, they represent less than 1 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the United States each year, said Krista Eberle, director of the food safety program at the trade association Egg Safety Institute. ""This is one of the larger recalls that have happened,"" Eberle said. But she added, ""This is an extremely rare occurrence.""

390,"(CNN) -- The death toll from massive floods in Pakistan rose to 1,497 on Friday as U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said the crisis is a ""slow-motion tsunami"" that is expected to grow. The number of homeless as a result of flooding has doubled to 4 million. Ban urged the international community to give more aid during a special fundraising meeting Thursday night. ""Make no mistake,"" he said. ""This is a global disaster, a global challenge. It is one of the greatest tests of global solidarity in our times."" The U.N. secretary-general, who traveled to Pakistan last weekend to visit sites devastated by the disaster, said almost 20 million people need shelter, food and emergency care. ""That is more than the entire population hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Kashmir earthquake, Cyclone Nargis, and the earthquake in Haiti -- combined,"" he said. Are you there? Share your photos and videos . The United Nations has already appealed for $460 million over the next three months, Ban said, and although donors delivered more than a half, the available resources are not sufficient to meet the needs on the ground. The European Commission has pledged 40 million euros ($51 million) since July 31 for the flood victims. It said it will mobilize an additional 30 million euros (about $38 million). ""This disaster is like few the world has ever seen. It requires a response to match,"" Ban said. ""Pakistan needs a flood of support."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who also attended the General Assembly meeting, announced an additional $60 million in U.S. aid. The funds bring to $150 million the amount pledged to Pakistan by the United States. ""I want the people of Pakistan to know: The United States will be with you through this crisis,"" she said. ""We will be with you as the rivers rise and fall. We will be with you as you replant your fields and repair your roads. And we will be with you as you meet the long-term challenge to build a stronger nation and a better future for your families."" Clinton urged other nations to help the nation meet its funding goals. Analysts have blamed ""donor fatigue"" for the delay in aid. Pakistan has been on a seemingly constant round of donor needs -- to revive its feeble economy, to fight the Taliban and to recover from the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2009 refugee crisis.","U.N. chief calls Pakistan floods ""a global disaster""

391,"(CNN) -- A police chase through central Dallas, Texas, ended on the runways of Love Field after a man driving a stolen pickup truck crashed through the airport's gates Thursday afternoon, officials said. Police had tried to stop the truck on a nearby street after they realized it was taken during an aggravated robbery in Fort Worth, Texas, on Wednesday, Dallas police said in a statement. The driver refused to stop and the chase began shortly after 2:30 p.m. The man drove the silver Chevrolet through an airport gate and down one runway, drove across the taxiway to another and back in the opposite direction. ""Air traffic was suspended on that runway, however there were several plane[s] at the opposite end of the runway that the suspect began driving towards,"" the statement said. ""Supervisors monitoring the pursuit made the decision to terminate the pursuit by whatever means necessary so as to preserve the safety of the occupants of the planes. Officers were able to strike the suspect vehicle with their police car, causing it to spin out and ultimately come to a stop. The suspect was taken into custody shortly after that."" A knife believed to have been used in the Fort Worth robbery was recovered in the truck, police said. The suspect was identified as Michael Laurence Brown, 46. Police said the suspect may be linked to other crimes. Charges in the airport incident will follow an initial investigation, police said. ""Although all major incidents such as this are reviewed to ensure all proper procedures were followed, it appears all the officers involved did an outstanding job to bring a dangerous pursuit to a safe end while getting a violent criminal off the streets,"" according to the police statement. Four commercial carriers and several general aviation companies use the airport, located just north of downtown Dallas. The chase shut down operations for about 10 minutes, forcing one arriving aircraft to delay its landing and holding departing planes on the ground, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said.","NEW: Police were worried suspect would try to drive into planes .

392,"(CNN) -- King Nut Companies issued a total recall of peanut butter that it distributes Saturday amid fears of a salmonella outbreak that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said has infected 399 people in 42 states. Salmonella bacteria are transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods. Ohio-based King Nut acknowledged in a statement that salmonella had been found in an open 5-pound tub of King Nut peanut butter. ""We are very sorry this happened,"" Martin Kanan, president of King Nut Companies, said in the statement. ""We are taking immediate and voluntary action because the health and safety of those who use our products is always our highest priority."" King Nut peanut butter was identified as the source of an outbreak that may have contributed to one death in Minnesota, state public health officials said Friday. King Nut said Saturday that peanut butter sold under its label was manufactured by Peanut Corporation of America. The release gave no other details on the manufacturer, but Peanut Corporation of America's Web site lists its headquarters as Lynchburg, Virginia, and says it has processing operations in Virginia, Georgia and Texas. Peanut Corporation of America could not be immediately reached for comment. The CDC is working with public health officials in the 42 affected states to determine the cause of the outbreak of a type of salmonella called Typhimurium.  Learn more about salmonella » . The first cases were reported September 3, but most cases occurred between October 1 and December 31, the CDC said. About 18 percent of victims were hospitalized as a result of their illness, and patients' ages have ranged from 2 months to 98 years. California is reporting the highest case count, with 55, followed by Ohio with 53 cases, Massachusetts with 39, Minnesota with 30 and Michigan with 20. The other 37 states are each reporting fewer than 20 cases. Eight states have reported no cases connected to the outbreak. They are Montana, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Florida, Alaska and Hawaii. In its statement, King Nut said it distributes peanut butter ""only through food service accounts. It is not sold directly to consumers."" The statement added, ""King Nut does not supply any of the ingredients for the peanut butter distributed under its label. All other King Nut products are safe and not included in this voluntary recall."" Strains of salmonella linked to previous outbreaks have been traced to contaminated eggs, meat, poultry, vegetables, pet food and peanut butter. Salmonella infections can be treated with antibiotics, though some strains are resistant to these drugs, according to the CDC. Most people infected develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within a few days of infection, and their illness can last up to a week. Most recover without treatment, but some may suffer dehydration and, in severe cases, require hospitalization. Children, senior citizens, people with chronic illnesses and those with weak immune systems tend to be at highest risk for complications, according to the National Institutes of Health.","King Nut says salmonella found in 5-pound tub of peanut butter .

393,"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Authorities do not plan to file charges against a Florida orange grove owner who fatally shot a 21-year-old woman, saying he is protected under the state's controversial ""no retreat"" law. Bullet holes pocked the windshield of the crashed SUV, and blood stained he passenger seat. But the woman's boyfriend faces second-degree murder charges in her death, because the woman was shot to death during an alleged felony -- the theft of an SUV. Tony Curtis Phillips, 29, didn't fire a single shot. He didn't even know his girlfriend, Nikki McCormick, was dead until police showed him an online news story. Police said McCormick accompanied Phillips as he attempted to steal the SUV from a barn in an orange grove near Wahneta, Florida, before daylight Tuesday. Grove owner Ladon ""Jamie"" Jones opened fire as the SUV approached him, according to an affidavit released by the Polk County Sheriff's Office. Phillips fled; McCormick was shot in the head and later died. Authorities said Jones is protected by Florida's ""no retreat"" law, which gives him the right to use lethal force if he reasonably believes his life is in danger. Phillips, however, faces charges because police allege he was committing felony grand theft auto at the time of McCormick's death. ""Because his conduct caused her death, he gets charged with a felony,"" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said. Phillips was arrested late Tuesday in Polk County, near Lakeland, after a day on the run. Police said he didn't believe McCormick was dead at first, telling officers, ""Of all the times you've questioned me, this is a nasty trick you're playing on me this time."" He agreed to cooperate if detectives could prove she was dead. Judd said detectives called up the shooting story on the local newspaper's Web site and ""let him read it online, and that's when he broke down and cried, and gave us a confession,"" Judd said. According to the affidavit, Jones heard his Toyota Land Cruiser, parked in the barn at his orange grove, start up before daylight Tuesday. Jones told police he grabbed his gun, a 9mm that he keeps with him while working at the grove. He said he could see two people in the SUV as it backed out of the barn, according to the affidavit. He said he saw the passenger's arm reach outside the vehicle, and believed that person might be holding a gun. The Land Cruiser stopped directly in front of him, Jones said in the affidavit. He said he raised his gun and pointed it at the occupants, shouting ""Stop,"" but the vehicle appeared to be moving directly toward him. ""Fearing for his life, he then fired what he thought to be six to eight rounds into the front windshield of the vehicle,"" the affidavit stated. The vehicle backed up at high speed, crashed through a fence and ended up in a ditch. Jones told police a man jumped out of the SUV and ran away. Sheriff's deputies found McCormick inside the vehicle with a bullet wound to her head. She was taken to Lakeland Regional Medical Center, where she died. Jones did not return a call from CNN seeking comment. Authorities will forward their information to prosecutors, Judd said, but are ""not going to file any charges [against Jones] at this point, because we don't see any reason to arrest Mr. Jones,"" Judd said. ""... It appears, at this point in the investigation, Mr. Jones was completely, legally justified in his actions."" A Polk County judge on Thursday ordered Phillips held without bond. A public defender was appointed to his case. Polk County Public Defender J. Marion Moorman declined to comment on the charges to CNN. ""We will, of course, be interviewing the client very soon, and will be undertaking his defense from there,"" he said. Phillips told police he assumed McCormick had also gotten out of the vehicle and run away, according to the affidavit. He said he was sorry for what happened ""and said he knew he was partially responsible for her death,"" the affidavit said. Polk County State Attorney's Office spokesman Chip Thulberry said his office will review the case when the sheriff's investigation is completed. The Brady Campaign to prevent Gun Violence says Florida is one of 16 states that have enacted ""no retreat"" laws, which some call ""shoot-first"" laws. The laws extend the right to use deadly force beyond a person's home and into public places. ""The shoot-first law is not needed,"" said Brian Malte of the Brady Campaign. ""This person, regardless of the situation, may have done the right thing, but he cannot be prosecuted for doing something wrong if he hit an innocent bystander,"" he said. Other groups stand by the ""no retreat"" laws. ""At the moment a crime occurs, victims don't have the luxury of time,"" said Andrew Arulanandam of the National Rifle Association. ""They have seconds to decide on a course of action to protect their lives and their families. This law provides law-abiding people with options.""","Tony Curtis Phillips, 29, charged in girlfriend's shooting death .

394,"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Chanthu, the third typhoon of the West Pacific season, slowed down Thursday as it made its way over land in southern China. As the tropical storm drenched a region already inundated by heavy rain and deadly flooding, its top winds slowed to 63 mph (101 kph). It had made landfall with winds above 70 mph at 1:45 p.m. in Wuchuan City in southern China's Guangdong Province, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. The government ordered evacuations in severely affected areas, especially in ports, fishing farms on the sea, dilapidated housing and low-lying ground. It urged local governments to step up flood control efforts. No casualties have been reported so far. Torrential rains and flooding this year already have been the worst in a decade, claiming the lives of 701 people and leaving 347 missing, Xinhua said, citing government figures. Chanthu could drench some rain-swollen areas with another 20 inches of rain, said CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. As the storm moves by, an area of particular concern is the region along the Yangtze River, which already has experienced the worst flooding in 30 years. Floodgates on the Three Gorges Dam have been opened to control the flow, and pictures from the scene show huge volumes of water pouring from it. Throughout the country, floods have hit 27 provinces and municipalities, affecting 110 million people, according to Xinhua. It said more than 8 million people have been relocated. About 287,000 military personnel have been mobilized in anti-flood operations, and schools are being advised to do what they can to ensure students' safety.","NEW: Typhoon is downgraded as it crosses over land .

395,"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A weather system moving over the southern Bahamas has been upgraded to a tropical storm, with sustained winds now reported at 40 miles an hour, as it heads toward the southern tip of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. The system has been named Tropical Storm Bonnie. At 11 p.m. ET, it was moving northwest at 14 miles an hour as it approached the northwestern Bahamas, according to the National Hurricane Center. It could pick up strength as it moves over the long stretch of open water in the Gulf of Mexico, but the latest computer models do not show it becoming a hurricane, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. Forecasters had predicted that it would cross over central Florida, but the models now show it passing farther south, over the Florida Keys or the Straits of Florida and then into the Gulf. The storm is expected to pass the southern tip of Florida on Friday afternoon and then make landfall Sunday between New Orleans and the Beaumont-Port Arthur area in southeastern Texas. Myers said it's more likely to bear down on Louisiana. And on that path, it could push oil in the Gulf from the BP oil spill to shore. But at this point, no oil has spilled into the Gulf for the past seven days, with BP's crippled well contained with a cap that appears to be bearing up under ""integrity"" tests. BP's chief operating officer, Doug Suttles, said Thursday that skimmers had been able to recover only 56 barrels of oil the day before, because that's all they could find. With the weather turning bad, BP has suspended work on a relief well to permanently seal the damaged well.  And late Thursday, the federal official overseeing the effort, retired  Adm. Thad Allen, ordered ships in the area to come to shore. That could delay operations at the well site for 10 to 14 days. But Allen said there's enough confidence in the well that it will be left capped and closed during the rough weather. Ships used to skim oil off the surface are likely to have to come ashore as well. Currently, 215 are operating off the coast of Louisiana. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has issued an emergency declaration, intended to speed state help to parishes that need it, when the storm hits. He said mandatory evacuations are not expected, but parishes might call for voluntary evacuations in some low-lying areas. The weather system is drenching the Bahamas and has caused flooding in Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for Florida's east coast, from Golden Beach south to the Keys, and along the west coast, northward to Bonita Beach. In Monroe County, Florida, which comprises the Keys, officials warned boaters to secure their vessels and remain in port until winds and seas subside. They warned drivers to use extreme caution on the Overseas Highway, especially on exposed bridges. The hurricane center predicted that the storm would bring 2 to 4 inches of rain to south Florida, with isolated areas receiving as much as 6 inches. The central and northwest Bahamas are likely to receive slightly more, the hurricane center said.

396,"(CNN) -- A confidential report on safety conditions aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, conducted about one month before the rig's explosion, points to widespread fear of reprisal for reporting employee mistakes that could undermine safety aboard the rig. ""There was a stated fear of reprisal related specifically to the reporting of dropped objects,"" states an executive summary of the report obtained by CNN. ""Only 46.3 percent of participants felt that, if their actions led to a potentially risky situation (e.g., forgetting to do something, damaging equipment, dropping an object from height), they could report it without any fear of reprisal,"" the report states. Transocean, the rig operator, commissioned the survey of about 40 employees, about half its staff aboard the Deepwater Horizon. The report concluded, ""Deepwater Horizon was relatively strong in many of the core aspects of safety management."" But it also uncovered fear among workers of suffering reprisal for reporting conditions that could lead to a ""risky"" situation onboard the rig. The study also found some Transocean employees entered fake data to try to circumvent a safety system, according to a person familiar with the full report. The study was based on surveys conducted March 12-16 by Lloyd's Register Group, a consultant that analyzes the safety of business processes and products. The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded the night of April 20 while drilling BP's Macondo oil well. Two days later it sank. The Lloyd's report was completed afterwards; it is dated May 11. Lloyd's said it was retained by Transocean to ""proactively understand their safety culture and assess the equipment on the Deepwater Horizon."" Transocean has commissioned safety surveys of its staff aboard 20 other drilling rigs. A spokesperson for Transocean insisted the study of employees aboard Deepwater Horizon reflected the company's commitment to safety. ""This rig did go seven years without a lost-time incident or any major environmental accidents,"" said spokesman Lou Colasuonno. ""This rig was exhibit-A for a well-run rig."" In assessing the safety culture onboard the rig, the consultants gave ratings of between 2.9 to 3.5 on a scale of 1 to 5 for policies such as leadership, communication, training and monitoring. A separate report by a different Transocean consultant on the Deepwater Horizon's equipment cited at least 26 components and systems out of 129 categories on the rig that were in ""bad"" or ""poor"" condition, according to a report in Thursday's New York Times. Transocean's spokesman told CNN all equipment on the Deepwater Horizon was in line with government guidelines. ""Every device met regulatory standards,"" Colasuonno said.","Report: Deepwater Horizon workers feared reprisal for reporting safety-related actions .

397,"(CNN) -- Soldiers and rescue workers on Friday pulled stranded people out of deluged swathes of southern China inundated by 11 days of heavy rain, state media said. The rains have led to the deaths of 211 people in 10 provinces, while 119 others are listed as missing, according to Xinhua news agency. Two dikes on the eastern Fu River in Jiangxi broke on Wednesday, forcing another 100,000 people to join the 2.3 million already evacuated, state officials estimated. More than 29 million people have been affected by the flooding, Chinese media reported. The government sent thousands of soldiers and rescuers to the region to assist in the evacuation effort and help repair the broken dikes. Officials said the repairs will run through next week, though storms could hamper the effort, Xinhua said. Eleven days of heavy rains in China caused the flooding, according to Xinhua.","Death toll from China flooding rises to 211 .

398,"(CNN) -- A sailor has described her ""miraculous"" escape after a whale leapt out of the water and crash-landed on the deck of her boat off the coast of South Africa. Paloma Werner, 50, of the Cape Town Sailing Academy, and her partner Ralph Mothes had been watching the whale from a distance in Table Bay, near Cape Town harbor, when it moved toward their 10-meter vessel and breached 20 meters away. Southern right whales are a common sight in Cape Town waters during the breeding season from June to November, drawing whale watchers to the region. Werner said the couple -- both experienced sailors -- expected the creature to go under the boat before re-emerging on the other side. ""I looked around and I saw this huge whale coming out of the water and smashing against the side of the boat,"" Werner told CNN. ""The whale slipped back into the water but we just saw the mast with all its rigging and everything flying towards us, and that was scary, actually."" Werner said Mothes ducked behind the steering wheel which bore the impact of the mast. And while the masts need replacing, Werner said the steel structure of the boat was undamaged. ""Miraculously nothing happened to us,"" she added. A tourist on a nearby boat captured the moment when the whale breached out of the water on camera. Werner said she had spoken to a local marine mammal expert who had told her that the incident was a ""freak accident."" Because the couple had been sailing without the engine on, the whale had failed to hear them, she said. ""It was a young southern right whale and he was just having fun. They have very poor eyesight and obviously if they're breaching visibility is very poor. The whale did not intend to attack us, it just did not hear us."" Whale experts have taken DNA samples from blubber left on the deck to see whether they have any existing records on the animal. Werner said the whale appeared to be unhurt by the experience: ""We saw it afterwards and there was no blood or anything. I think for a whale it was just a scratch and a bump."" In future, the couple would make sure they had the engine on while sailing during whale season, she added. ""We were just going out sailing because it was an awesome day. Obviously it's a bonus if you see a whale but we didn't quite count on having one on top of the boat.""","Southern right whale lands on sailing boat in ""freak accident""

399,"New Orleans (CNN) -- A control unit on the Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventer was leaking hydraulic fluid before the explosion that unleashed the worst oil spill in U.S. history, a BP official testified Tuesday. Ronald Sepulvado, one of BP's well site leaders -- ""company men,"" in rig jargon -- told the Coast Guard-Interior Department board investigating the drill platform's sinking that there were ""off and on"" problems with valves that directed hydraulic fluid inside the mechanism. He said he reported the problem to his superiors, but the rig continued to operate despite the problem. Federal regulations require that drilling work halt if a control ""pod"" is inoperable. Sepulvado said the unit was still functional, but his team leader should have reported the issue to the Minerals Management Service, the recently reorganized Interior Department agency that regulated offshore drilling. ""I guess we assumed that everything was OK, since I reported it to the team leader and he should have reported it to the MMS,"" Sepulvado said. His team leader, BP executive John Guide, is scheduled to testify before the investigative board Thursday. Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventer failed to shut down the runaway well at the heart of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill after the April 20 explosion aboard the rig. The resulting fire sank the platform, leaving 11 workers dead and releasing an undersea gusher that engineers were unable to contain until last week. Sepulvado and Donald Vidrine were the two ""company men"" who worked aboard the rig, but Sepulvado was ashore at the time of the blast for additional training on blowout preventers. He was replaced on the rig by Robert Kaluza, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination Tuesday when called to testify. Vidrine has been excused from testifying for medical reasons, the company said Monday night. The board released a list of more than 20 reported anomalies with the well in the 18 hours before the explosion, ranging from low pressure readings and larger-than-expected returns of ""mud,"" the drilling fluid used as a counterweight and lubricant aboard the rig. Both Vidrine and Kaluza were involved in discussions about the anomalous pressure readings in the hours before the explosion, the according to the list. BP, rig owner Transocean and well cementing contractor Halliburton all blamed each other for the disaster. Previous hearings have included testimony about maintenance backlogs aboard the rig and disputes between BP and Transocean managers about procedures as they prepared to shut in the well, which was already behind schedule. Ross Skidmore, a subsea supervisor for BP contractor Swift, testified Tuesday he questioned why BP was waiting to install a ""lockdown sleeve"" -- a fitting placed atop the well to secure the casing -- after drilling fluid was replaced with seawater for pressure tests. ""I asked why couldn't we go ahead and do this in mud,"" he said. In response, Skidmore said he was told ""It wasn't going to happen. We were going to go through the sequence we were given."" Skidmore said he's ""selective"" about questioning his orders. But he added, ""If I would have seen something and recognized it as being unsafe or a threat, I would have taken it all the way into town."" This week's hearings come as scientists continue testing pressure in BP's ruptured deepwater well and weighing options for permanently sealing it. Even as lawyers and witnesses resist some questions before the panel, the hearings are providing dramatic details of what happened on the rig, and could form the basis for criminal charges down the line. A sworn statement from Deepwater Horizon Chief Engineer Steven Bertone sparked particularly heated debate Monday. In it, Bertone described the rig's captain screaming at a crew member who issued a distress call and ordering an injured man left behind. Lawyers repeatedly attempted to ask Bertone about the document, which has not been publicly released. But his lawyer, Steven London, said the statement was made while his client was ""detained"" aboard a rescue ship and told Bertone not to answer questions about it. ""This statement was obtained from him while he was held 26 hours right immediately after this incident, which was extremely traumatic to say the least,"" London said. ""It is what it is. We're not going to be cross-examined on something that occurred, that was written down at that time."" An attorney for rig captain Curt Kutcha criticized lawyers for introducing the statement. It was ""an attempt to assassinate his character in one aspect of what's being done where all their lives were at risk,"" attorney Kyle Schonekas said. But BP lawyer Richard Godfrey seized on the statement, saying it showed ""a complete loss of command and control aboard the bridge"" after the explosions. Bertone also testified Monday that the rig's bridge crew was unsure who had the authority to activate the rig's emergency disconnection from the well. When it was activated, it failed to work despite indications on the control panel that it had been activated, he said.

400,"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- The weather system known as Bonnie has been downgraded from a tropical storm to a tropical depression as it moves across the Gulf of Mexico -- and there are indications it may not get too much stronger. As of 11 p.m. ET, the system was moving through the eastern Gulf after crossing southern Florida earlier Friday. It had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. The depression was moving west-northwest at a very fast clip for such weather systems -- 17 mph. Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center said the storm was expected to cross over the Gulf coast, anywhere from Louisiana to southeastern Texas, late Saturday night, earlier than had been anticipated previously. The fast pace means it won't be spending as much time over the warm Gulf water, leaving less time to build up strength. CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers said an area of low pressure in the Gulf has been creating some competing winds that have been pulling clouds away from the cyclone and weakening it. Still, the hurricane center said the system may slow, and a tropical storm warning is in effect from Destin, Florida, to Morgan City, Louisiana, including Lake Pontchartrain. And Bonnie still could bring drenching rain to Louisiana and other states along the coast, the hurricane center said, creating a storm surge ranging from two to four feet. The hurricane center said Bonnie could bring one to three inches of rain across the region, with rainfall of five inches in some areas. Bonnie made landfall as a tropical storm earlier Friday near Biscayne Bay in southeastern Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. But it weakened as it crossed over the state. Even though Bonnie has weakened, uncertainty over the weather already has hampered operations at BP's cripped well in the Gulf. BP suspended work on a relief well to permanently seal the damaged well. And the federal official overseeing the effort, retired Adm. Thad Allen, ordered ships in the area to shore because of the choppy seas and gusty winds that Bonnie will bring. That could delay operations atthe well site for 10 to 14 days. But Allen said there's enough confidence in the well's ""integrity"" that it will be left capped and closed during the rough weather. Ships used to skim oil off the surface will have to come ashore as well. Hundreds have been operating off the coast. Meanwhile, states of emergency have been declared in both Louisiana and Mississippi. The emergency declarations are intended to speed state help to local goverments that need it and allow emergency crews to respond more efficiently. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Thursday afternoon it's ""good for Louisiana"" that the weather system is moving so fast, since it may not strengthen significantly and is likely to move across Louisiana fairly quickly. Still, he said about a half dozen Louisiana parishes have called for voluntary evacuations from low-lying areas and mobile home parks. The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services encouraged residents Friday to prepare for the storm by pre-applying for Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, previously known as Disaster Food Stamps. The program offers help buying groceries for those who do not regularly receive nutrition assistance but who are affected by lost wages or damages because of a disaster. Officials said that pre-applying does not guarantee benefits but is designed to prevent long waits. The weather system earlier drenched the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic as it moved from the Caribbean to the Atlantic. When it reached Florida, residents in Cutler Bay saw tree branches littering the roads as Bonnie passed through Miami-Dade County. ""It was pouring rain for four to five hours straight,"" said Matthew Slack, a bartender at Cutler Bay Sports Bar and Grill. But he added, ""It's not that bad. It's like a regular summer storm in Miami."" The storm also slowed business in southern Florida. ""We've had a lot of people call and say they might have to cancel due to the storm,"" said Susie Bishop of Continental Inn Condominiums in Marathon, Florida. ""I had a few people leave a few days early."" CNN meteorologist Sean C. Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: Tropical Depression Bonnie is moving through the eastern Gulf of Mexico .

401,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- They are the first victims of the oil disaster that has devastated the Gulf region: 11 oil rig workers killed on April 20 when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, torching the sky and puncturing the sea. Their remains have been lost in the Gulf of Mexico. At least 15 others were injured in the massive explosion. Victims and their families are suing BP and Transocean, the Swiss-based company that owns the drilling rig. But getting a settlement from Transocean, the world's largest offshore drilling company, could be difficult. Q&A on the legal liability of the companies involved in the oil disaster . The company has invoked a 19th century American law to limit its liability to $26.76 million, a fraction of what the plaintiffs are likely to seek. ""It may work,"" said Martin Davies, professor of law and director of Tulane University's Maritime Law Center. ""They've got a chance."" Transocean's pre-emptive strike is part of the legal thicket confronting victims, where a patchwork of arcane and sometimes inconsistent laws will most likely make the ensuing litigation one of the most complex cases in American history. The Deepwater Horizon is technically a mobile offshore drilling unit. Under maritime law, it is classified as a seagoing vessel, just like a freighter or passenger ship. Three weeks after the accident, Transocean petitioned a U.S. federal court for protection under the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851. Congress enacted the law to spur investment in shipping and keep the U.S. Merchant Marine fleet competitive with other seafaring nations. To help the American shipping industry, the government limited ship owners' liability to the value of the vessel plus the money the owner would collect for completing its voyage. But now that the Deepwater Horizon is a wreck on the ocean floor, the vessel is worthless, according to Transocean. Read the affidavit stating Deepwater Horizon's value is ""$0.00 dollars"" Transocean says the remaining value of its drilling contract with BP at the time of the April 20 disaster was $26,764,083. That amount, the company argues, is the maximum it is legally required to pay to victims. ""Totally ridiculous,"" said Kurt Arnold, a Houston, Texas, attorney representing two of the victims. Transocean's ability to use the law may depend on a judge's ruling on who at Transocean knew of potential problems and when they knew it. Much of the focus has been on BP and its liability in the Gulf oil catastrophe. Survivors of the explosion told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview that a BP official wanted workers to replace heavy mud -- used to keep the well's pressure down -- with lighter seawater to help speed a process that was costing an estimated $750,000 a day and was already running five weeks late.   More on the survivors' account . In the claims against Transocean, its lawyers will try to prove that Transocean's top managers did not know about conditions that would cause the accident. If they succeed, the Limitation of Liability Act will apply. Lawyers for the victims will argue that Transocean officials had enough of what the 1851 law calls ""privity or knowledge"" to hold the company responsible for the full value of the death and injury claims. Publicly, the victims' lawyers say they are confident they can ""break the limit."" But law professor Davies disagreed: ""It's not a slam dunk."" If Transocean prevails, a relatively small pool of money would be split among the victims. If the money ends up being shared on a pro-rated formula, ""nobody's getting paid 100 percent,"" said Joshua Force, a plaintiff's lawyer in New Orleans, Louisiana. Smaller payouts also affect lawyers who work on contingency fees. The less they recover for their clients, the less the lawyers get paid. Read how some lawyers could get a huge payout . A Transocean press release states, without elaboration, that ""Transocean will honor all of its legal obligations arising from the Deepwater Horizon accident."" The company said the petition seeking shelter under the Limitation of Liability Act was filed ""at the instruction of its insurers and in order to preserve insurance coverage."" ""It's understandable self protection,"" Davies said, ""but it still has an unsavory feel to it."" Especially, he added, since the proposed limit is a ""far smaller amount than what they've recovered from their insurers."" Transocean carried $560 million in insurance on the Deepwater Horizon -- more than its book value, according to company officials. Transocean noted a $270 million ""accounting gain"" -- or profit -- from the insurance payout in a May 6 conference call with investors. Another point of contention is where any future legal battle takes place. Transocean argues that Houston is the proper venue, because its American headquarters is there. But lawyers for the victims want to move the case to New Orleans, which they argue is more convenient for their clients and closer to the scene of the disaster. The lawyers are competing for the ""subterranean sympathy you can get from a judge,"" Davies said. Judges ""are all supposed to be objective, but the New Orleans judges are likely to be more ticked off about it than in Houston,"" he said. Critics, including Davies, say the Limitation of Liability Act is anachronistic and ""no longer serving the purpose that it was intended to serve."" It should be amended, said attorney Scott Bickford, who represents victims. ""The law ought to just deal with cargo at this point,""  not personal injury and wrongful death claims, he told CNN. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said the law should be repealed, ""so that no company has the opportunity to walk away from its responsibility."" But if the law is so antiquated, why wasn't it changed years ago? ""You can't get Congress to pay attention to anything on maritime law,"" Davies said. ""It's not a very sexy issue until there's a disaster.""","Families of oil workers killed, hurt in Gulf file lawsuits against BP, Transocean .

402,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- As Tropical Depression Bonnie churns through the Gulf of Mexico, several response vessels at the site of BP's ruptured well are in the process of being moved out of harm's way Friday, possibly leaving the sealed well cap unattended for about 48 hours, federal officials said. ""The intention right now is to put the vessels in a safe place so they can return as quickly as possible,"" retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said. The rigs drilling the relief wells and the Q4000 recovery vessel are expected to be fully disconnected by late Friday afternoon, Allen said in a briefing Friday. Operators manning the vessels will begin to move to a position of the ""best survivability,"" he added. Even if the vessels monitoring the well have to depart, Allen said, they'll perform aerial and satellite surveillance and leave recording equipment at the base of the well to continue observation. ""If we have to evacuate the scene, we're probably looking at a very limited window, probably 48 hours,"" he said. Allen also addressed the ""good and bad part"" of a tropical storm hitting the Gulf region: While he acknowledged how a storm surge could drive the oil into beach and marsh areas, where it would have not been driven otherwise, Allen says the increased weather activity may ""actually help"" disperse the oil. ""So we're mindful that those are two consequences and prepared to move out and aggressively attack this once the threat is passed through. But in [the] meantime, preservation of life and preservation of equipment are our highest priority,"" Allen said. Later, Allen told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, ""it's certainly going to be a setback"" in the effort to permanently seal the well and clean up the Gulf. He noted that 800 skimmers that had been collecting oil on the surface across the Gulf Coast will be returning to safety on shore but said authorities are slowly making progress. ""I'm not ready to declare victory, nor should anybody. But we certainly are starting to gain a bit of an upper hand here,"" he said. ""Of course, we still have beach cleanup and marshland areas that are affected."" BP said that pressure in the well continues to ""slowly increase."" Company officials said they will continue to take pressure readings and monitor the well as long as weather permits. On Thursday, officials said the departure of the relief well rig could delay work on the operation -- described as the permanent fix to the ruptured well -- for at least 10 days. Allen said the cap placed over the damaged well in the Gulf of Mexico will remain sealed and continue to stop oil from escaping even if the more than 2,000 people who have been working at the well site are off the water. The weather could force officials to temporarily scale back efforts to search beneath the surface for leaking oil. But Allen said Thursday that the remote vehicles used to monitor the area will be the last to leave and the first to return. Sensors and extensive monitoring have allowed observers to ""rule out any indications that there might be a leak,"" Allen said Thursday, noting that his confidence in the integrity of the well had ""improved dramatically"" after he examined data over the past few days. Once the weather system passes, a plan to pump mud into the well to force oil back into the reservoir below is in the works. BP has Allen's approval to prepare for the ""static kill"" process but would still need the government's final go-ahead before proceeding, BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said. Meanwhile, officials monitoring the spill say they continue to track the tropical weather and communicate with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is ultimately responsible for the safety of the more than 40,000 people assisting in recovery and response efforts in the Gulf region. ""The protection of the equipment and crew is paramount to ensure maximum ability to respond to any new challenges a storm may pose to the enormous mission,"" Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft, the federal on-scene coordinator, said in a news release Thursday. ""We are repositioning assets away from low-lying areas to higher-ground staging areas to protect our ability to respond to the dynamic requirements of the incident,"" Zukunft said. At 5 p.m. ET Friday, Bonnie had been downgraded to a tropical depression after moving across southern Florida. It was moving west-northwest at 18 miles an hour and had maximum sustained winds of 35 miles an hour. It's expected to make landfall early Sunday between New Orleans, Louisiana, and southeastern Texas. If the storm continues on its path, it could slam into the area of the BP oil spill and possibly push more oil to shore. The tropical weather system could diminish or erase encouraging signs of recovery from the BP oil spill, according to a scientist who spearheaded the first major examination of the Louisiana coast wetlands. ""Early marsh regrowth could easily be taken away with high winds and waves,"" said Tom Bianchi, a Texas A&M oceanography professor who has spent his career researching marshes. Meanwhile, at a federal hearing in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Friday, a Deepwater Horizon chief engineering technician testified that the rig's general alarm system -- which is designed to detect a sudden rise in natural gas -- had been disabled because rig managers ""did not want people woke up at 3 in the morning due to false alarms."" Technician Mike Williams said the alarm system had been been ""inhibited"" for about a year before the April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers and started the worst oil disaster in the nation's history. Williams said supervisors on the Transocean rig were aware that the system had been inhibited. Transocean later said in a statement that the disabling was ""intentional and conforms to accepted maritime practices."" ""It was not a safety oversight or done as a matter of convenience,"" it said. The company said there were hundreds of individual fire and gas alarms on the Deepwater Horizon in a ""zone-based"" system. The rig had an option -- which was resorted to -- to prevent the general alarm from sounding when an individual alarm went off. Transocean said it's possible that individual alarms might be providing notification of ""minor issues or a non-emergency,"" and ""repeated false alarms increase risk and decrease rig safety."" CNN's Ashley Fantz, Vivian Kuo and Sean Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: Retired Adm. Thad Allen says there is ""certainly going to be a setback"" at well site .

404,"Chicago, Illinois (CNN) -- Severe overnight storms in the Chicago area caused power outages, flight cancellations and flooded homes and roadways. About 50,000 ComEd customers were without electricity Saturday morning after lightning and heavy downpours pummeled the city overnight, said Laura Micheli, a spokeswoman for the utility. It was unclear when power would be restored to those households because storms were still rolling through the area, she said. The outages started at about 6 p.m. (7 p.m. ET) Friday night. CNN iReporter Nancy Holst of Lombard said her husband, who is a firefighter, responded to several calls overnight where he was working in waist-deep floodwaters. She said he took one look at her once-blooming garden now sitting under 6 inches of water and said, ""That's nothing."" The storms caused damage through Chicago suburbs before moving into downtown in the morning, she said. The bad weather also forced the cancellation of 200 flights at the Chicago O'Hare International Airport Saturday morning, according to Karen Pride of the Chicago Department of Aviation. There were delays of up to one hour at the airport at midday, she said, but no delays were reported at Midway International Airport. Pride said there was some airfield flooding at O'Hare Friday night, but flight operations were not affected.  The National Weather Service in Illinois reported that at least 6.3 inches of rain fell at O'Hare and 6.2 inches at Midway. CNN affiliate WGN reported more than 5 inches of rain were dumped over some parts of the Chicago area Saturday morning.  There were also reports of flooded basements and expressway closures.

405,"(CNN) -- A bus crashed into the side of a mountain Tuesday in western Bolivia, killing at least 13 people and injuring another 26, the government news agency reported. The driver lost control of the bus, which gained speed and smashed into rocks on the side of the road, said police official Victor Hugo Ona. The bus left the city of La Paz with 28 passengers but was later found to have 41 passengers and excess baggage, Ona told the state-run Agencia Boliviana de Informacion. Among the dead were seven men, four women and two minors, said Jose Villarroel, another police official. At least 19 of the injured were hospitalized. Bus driver Pedro Limachi, 45, was listed among the injured being treated at the Hospital Arco Iris in La Paz. The bus was operated by the Flota Yunguena transit company. Bolivia's mountainous roads often prove fatal.  A bus crash in central Bolivia in June left 28 dead and 44 injured after an apparent brake failure, police said at the time. That bus, which plunged into a ravine, was owned by the El Dorado company. A January bus accident killed 22 people.  And 19 people died and 26 were injured in August 2009 when a bus plunged off a mountain road.","Police: Driver lost control of the bus, which crashed into roadside boulders .

406,"(CNN) -- A Milwaukee, Wisconsin, motorist whose SUV fell into a large sinkhole thanked the passer-by who brought an end to the brief but terrifying ordeal. ""The road just went out from under me,"" Lance Treankler, the Cadillac Escalade driver, said Friday. ""When I landed, my head snapped back. I went unconscious for a few seconds. When I looked up, I saw water run over me."" That's when Mark Pawlik, 46, who was walking Thursday evening near Oakland and North avenues on Milwaukee's east side, came to the rescue. Pawlik told CNN affiliate WTMJ that he saw a nearby traffic light in the sinkhole and spotted the SUV heading right toward it. The vehicle disappeared and a traffic light landed on its roof. Pawlik saw the driver standing on the SUV's hood. ""I grabbed your hand. You looked at me and said, 'Get me out of here,' "" Pawlik told Treankler during their reunion, filmed by WTMJ. Treankler suffered only minor cuts and bruises in the incident, which occurred during a storm that brought heavy flooding to the city. It was not clear what part weather played in the sinkhole's formation. Crews will be able to retrieve the SUV from the 20-foot sinkhole Friday evening, said Barry McNulty, spokesman for We Energies. The sinkhole cut off power to the area, but about 200 businesses and homes should regain electricity Friday night, he said. Crews were building a temporary power line. Peter Panos, who owns the nearby Ma Fischer's Family Restaurant, said power was restored to his establishment about 3 p.m. CT. The SUV's engine remained running into Friday as police and fire officers decided how to proceed. ""I am very grateful for you helping me out,"" Treankler told Pawlik.","""The road just went out from under me,"" driver says .

407,"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- The Moscow skyline of the Kremlin and St. Basil's Cathedral vanished Friday as a blanket of thick, noxious smoke shrouded the metropolis, leaving many of the city's 10 million residents with sore throats and burning eyes. On Friday, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev visited a Moscow ambulance station, accompanied by top health officials. He was told that the number of emergency calls has increased by about 10 percent lately, related to the heat and smog. The acrid smoke, from thousands of square miles of wildfires, drove carbon monoxide levels in Moscow five times higher than what is considered safe, the Russian Health Ministry said. Residents were encouraged to stay indoors. Many who did not could be seen wearing masks as they walked outdoors. In interviews with the state-run RIA Novosti news agency, health officials likened the pollution levels to smoking several packs of cigarettes a day. Some flights to Moscow were diverted Friday because or poor visibility. The Russian Ministry for Health and Social Development reported Friday that 52 people have died as a result of the extensive fires in central Russia. Another 72 people needed treatment, 43 of whom remain hospitalized, it said. Fires were still burning Friday in 22 of the country's 83 regions. Tens of thousands of firefighters have been deployed to extinguish nearly 600 raging wildfires covering 500,000 acres, among the worst ever. The record heat wave gripping the country showed no signs of abating Friday. Temperatures climbed to 37 degrees Celsius (98 degrees Fahrenheit) in Moscow and hit 41 degrees Celsius (nearly 106 Fahrenheit) farther to the southeast in Tambov. By Sunday, Moscow could reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), a figure never before officially recorded in the city.

408,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 48 people were killed and scores were wounded Tuesday when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives-laden vest in central Baghdad as men were queuing up outside an Iraqi army recruitment center, the Interior Ministry said. At least 129 people were wounded in the blast, which took place in the morning in the Bab al-Moudham commercial area. The spokesman for the Iraqi military command in the capital, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, said Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered a number of officers who were near the attacker to be detained for questioning. Atta told Al-Iraqiya state television that Tuesday had been the final day of a weeklong recruitment drive and that a large number of recruits had been waiting to sign up when the attack occurred. Atta said the bomber's vest was stuffed with 30 kilograms (66 pounds) of the plastic explosive C4, TNT and ball bearings. The attack came amid the country's failure to form a government and the United States' troop drawdown ahead of President Barack Obama's August 31 deadline for ending all combat operations. The U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq, or UNAMI, condemned the act and expressed concern over continued acts of violence in the country, ""including those perpetrated during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan that symbolizes the values of peace, tolerance, generosity and solidarity."" ""UNAMI reiterates that agreement on the formation of the government will greatly contribute to strengthening Iraq's ability to protect its citizens and respond effectively to those who aim at perpetuating instability and insecurity in the country and reversing its path towards peace and prosperity."" The Iraqi government has been pushing to increase security ahead of the drawdown, which would leave a residual U.S. force of 50,000 troops focused on stability operations as well as advising and assisting Iraqi security forces. Recruitment centers for Iraqi security forces have frequently been targeted by suicide bombers. A recent campaign of bombings and shootings has targeted Iraqi forces, especially in the capital, where gunmen have attacked traffic police and attacked checkpoints, killing Iraqi troops. Many Iraqis have blamed the recent wave of violence on the current political paralysis, in which quarreling parties have failed to form a government nearly six months after parliamentary elections. The attack has increased concerns among Iraqis about the ability of security forces to protect them when they cannot protect a government office. An Interior Ministry official said two roadside bombs detonated last week outside the same center,  wounding three people. Extremist groups, such as al Qaeda in Iraq, are known to take advantage of political fissures to carry out more attacks to create further turmoil. A spate of other incidents occurred Tuesday, said an Interior Ministry official, who cited: . -- A generator caught fire in eastern Baghdad that killed two people and injured 25 others. -- A string of drive-by shootings and bombings in Baghdad and Diyala province that killed three people and wounded five. -- A roadside bomb in the capital that seriously wounded the judge who heads Baghdad's appeals. -- A car bomb that detonated in the town of Balad Ruz northeast of the capital, killing two other judges. -- A drive-by shooting in western Baghdad's Ameriya neighborhood that killed a senior Trade Ministry official. -- A drive-by shooting in eastern Baghdad that wounded three occupants of a car. -- A hand grenade thrown at a police patrol in western Baghdad that wounded a policeman and a civilian. The website iraqbodycount.org estimated that nearly 2,000 Iraqi civilians had been killed this year through June. ""We continue to bleed as a nation,"" Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Samir Sumaidaie, told CNNI. He called the attacks ""despicable,"" but said, ""We do not believe there is any chance that they will derail the political process or destabilize the country. People are fed up with them and I don't believe they will achieve any political purpose."" In Washington, Deputy White House Press Secretary Bill Burton said President Barack Obama condemned the attacks. ""There are obviously still people who want to derail the advances that the Iraqi people have made towards democracy, but they are firmly on track and we're confident that we're moving towards the end of our combat mission there,"" he said. The political crisis worsened on Monday when former Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's al-Iraqiya party announced that it was suspending talks with al-Maliki's coalition in response to comments he made in a television interview. Maysoon al-Damalouji, a spokeswoman for al-Iraqiya, told CNN the group decided to suspend negotiations after al-Maliki described Allawi's candidate list as a ""Sunni list"" in an interview aired Monday by the U.S.-funded network Alhurra. Al-Damalouji said they were demanding an apology to the supporters of al-Iraqiya. Allawi, a secular Shiite, heads the cross-sectarian al-Iraqiya list, which won the largest number of seats in the March 7 national elections. Al-Iraqiya garnered most of the Sunni Arab vote. The four top blocs are involved in weekslong negotiations to try to build a coalition with enough seats to form a government. A fragile mega-Shiite coalition was formed in May between al-Maliki's State of Law and the Iranian-backed Iranian National Alliance, which includes the followers of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, but the coalition collapsed this month after the INA rejected al-Maliki's nomination for a second term. Allawi and al-Maliki both claim the right to lead the next government. The two blocs have been holding talks. To form a government, a 163-seat majority of 325 seats in parliament is needed. Allawi's bloc had a narrow victory with 91 seats, while al-Maliki won 89. Western and Iraqi officials, including Allawi, have said Iraq's next government must be inclusive and representative, or violence could result. Sunnis largely boycotted the 2005 elections, leading to the emergence of a Shiite-led government. The move left the once-ruling minority disaffected and that contributed to the a bloody insurgency and sectarian warfare that gripped Iraq for years.

409,"(CNN) -- Gary Coleman's parents grieve ""more and more"" every day since their son died four weeks ago, but they said they hold no anger toward the actor's ex-wife over how she handled his death. Shannon Price, 24, ordered doctors to end Coleman's life support just a day after he fell into a coma, despite his living will's direction that he be kept alive at least 15 days. Sue and Willie Coleman appeared on HLN's ""The Joy Behar Show"" on Tuesday to talk about their son's life and the controversy surrounding his sudden death. ""We're not holding any animosity towards her because, like my wife said, she was young and inexperienced,"" Willie Coleman told Behar. Price, whom they never met, did not call Coleman's parents after he suffered a brain hemorrhage from a fall in his home May 26 or before he was removed from life support two days later, the Colemans said. His parents said they felt like they were robbed of a chance to say a last goodbye to their son. ""I hurt more and more every day,"" Willie Coleman said. ""More and more."" The Colemans spoke sadly about their estrangement from their son, who they adopted when he was four days old. The estrangement began when he became a legal adult. ""When Gary turned 18 years old, you know how you do a horse?"" Willie said. ""We were put out to pasture."" Willie Coleman said his son told him then that ""I just feel that you were holding me in prison."" ""He wanted to be his own man, do things his own way, so we tried to encourage him the best we could, we tried to guide him as much as we could, but it was his life,"" Sue Coleman said. The Colemans, who had helped guide the child actor's career to that point, left California and returned to the middle-class lives they had left behind in Chicago a decade earlier. ""Gary took on a whole new branch of individuals that wanted to manage his career and also manage his money,"" his father said. Although Gary Coleman sued his parents for mismanaging his money, resulting in a $1 million judgment for him in 1993, there was always love between them, they said. Willie Coleman said he has a handful of letters from his son that offer him comfort. ""Every once and a while, I pull those letters out and read,"" he said. ""In each of those letters is ended with 'Hey, guys. I love you guys and I know you love me too.'"" His father wants Coleman to be remembered by fans as ""the sweet little gentle boy that we raised."" The parents are staying out of the bitter legal fight that is brewing over Coleman's estate. A Provo, Utah, lawyer was named temporary special administrator to control the estate while a Utah judge decides a will dispute between ex-wife Shannon Price and former business associate Anna Gray.","No one called parents before ending actor's life support, they say .

410,"(CNN) -- The Cumberland River in Nashville, Tennessee, is predicted to be at flood stage overnight Friday, and flood levels should begin to fall after daylight, according to the National Weather Service. Flood warnings have been issued along the river . Flash flood warnings were in effect Thursday for parts of middle Tennessee after heavy rain battered the state overnight. The rain has subsided in and around Nashville, but more is in the forecast for the end of the week, the National Weather Service said. Heavy rain in parts of the state this week caused rivers and creeks to crest, and sent flood waters into the streets.  Dozens of roads were closed and some schools in middle Tennessee were closed or starting late Thursday, the Macon County (Tennessee) Times reported. Some areas, like the town of Red Boiling Springs, were pounded with as much as eight inches of rain in a 12-hour stretch Wednesday. Flood waters rushed into the town causing officials to close the entire downtown, police told CNN-affiliate WKRN. ""There were so many places that were dangerous to attempt to cross,"" said Jacob Jordan, an officer with the Red Boiling Springs Police Department. ""I have no idea where the road was. This was all one big body of water."" The rain comes as some Tennessee residents were still recovering from the devastating floods that hit the area in May.  Dozens of people died in those floods. The federal government declared 42 counties disaster areas and the flooding was blamed for more than $1.5 billion in property damage in the Nashville area.","Heavy rain pounded middle Tennessee overnight .

411,"(CNN) -- Thirty-three miners trapped 2,300 feet (701 meters) below ground in Chile are depending on food, medicine and supplies being dropped to them through a 4-inch-wide tube. What comes out of that tube will have to sustain the men both physically and mentally for a long time -- perhaps four months, experts say -- while a shaft wide enough to pull a man through is drilled. The miners already have been trapped for 18 days, since a rockslide inside the San Esteban gold and copper mine cut off their exit route. A probe retrieved a note from the miners Sunday saying all were alive and well in a cramped, 530-square-foot (50-square-meter) shelter. They survived by sharing tiny portions of canned fish stored in the shelter room. ""Medics now are beginning to put down glucose water through a tube, first starting off with liquids and rehydrating salts, then in the coming days will put more solid food down,"" CNN's Karl Penhaul reported Tuesday morning from the scene near the town of Copiapo in northern Chile. ""But psychologists say really it is the mental health that's the real thing,"" Penhaul added. Forced confinement for months in a small, dark, hot space with many other people will pose intense psychological and emotional challenges. The men will have to help one another, Penhaul said. ""They have to make sure on a day when somebody is feeling down, depressed, that the others keep him there to cheer him up,"" he said. Davitt McAteer, former director of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, said the situation is challenging on a number of levels, but the Chilean government seems to be doing everything right. ""It's difficult. It's the size of a studio apartment, and it's dark. Well, now there will be some lights put in, but the conditions were very, very difficult,"" he said Tuesday morning. ""You have to deal with bodily functions, and you've got to deal with that kind of question. Then you've got to deal with the psychological impact. ""Now, I think the fact that they've made it these 18 days is very, very positive. But the euphoria of making contact with the surface is going to last a couple days, and then it's going to be a long slog."" McAteer noted that with current technology, there's no reason the trapped miners have to be isolated from their families and society during their confinement. ""These miners are resilient people, but I think also it's a new era,"" he said. ""And I see no reason why you couldn't pass cell phones down to them, or computers, tethered down to them. So, we're in a new day. And something will need to be done to divert their attention. ... How do you come up with things for them to do and arrange things so that they can get their attention diverted from just sitting there waiting?"" Added Penhaul: ""The families on the surface will also play a role as well, establishing communication with their family members to tell them to keep strong, but above all, to stay patient. They could be down there until Christmas."" CNN's Karl Penhaul, Jim Kavanagh and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.","33 Chilean miners have been stuck inside mine for 18 days .

412,"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Investigators were trying to determine Wednesday what caused China's first fatal passenger plane crash in almost six years. A Henan Airlines flight with 96 people on board overshot a runway and crashed Tuesday night in the Yichun area of northern China, state media said. The plane broke into two pieces and burst into flames. On Wednesday, the government downgraded the death toll from the crash from 43 to 42 after a body that was torn apart was discovered to have been counted twice, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. Fifty-four people survived. Five children injured in the crash were in critical condition, said Xinhua, citing doctors in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, where they had been transferred. Another 10 people were severely injured, it said. ""The coming 48 hours are the dangerous period,"" said Wang Yongchen, deputy head of the No. 1 Hospital affiliated with Harbin Medical University. Four of the children suffered heavy respiratory tract burns, said Wang. The investigators' initial focus was to find the flight data recorder  -- commonly known as the ""black box"" -- that might yield clues as to what caused the Brazilian-made Embraer 190 jet to crash land in heavy fog on a patch of grass about 1.5 kilometers (0.9 miles) from the runway. The black box was found on the ground Wednesday morning, Xinhua said. Some passengers were thrown from the plane upon impact, according Xinhua, which cited the head of the publicity department of the Yichun city committee of the Communist Party of China. Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang led a team of transportation, health, work safety and security officials to Yichun after the crash, state media said. Two survivors told local television that the plane shook violently before it crashed and that thick smoke entered the cabin soon after impact. They said passengers were unable to open emergency exits after the wreck; survivors escaped through cracks in the fuselage. The plane was carrying 91 passengers, including five children, and five crew members when it crashed at 9:36 p.m. (9:36 a.m. ET), according to Xinhua, which cited a source with the Civil Aviation Administration of China. The Henan Airlines flight had taken off from Harbin on the 360-kilometer (225-mile) flight to Lindu Airport, about 9 kilometers (5.6 miles) from downtown Yichun, a city of about 1 million residents near the Russian border, Xinhua said. A Yichun vice-mayor told Xinhua that most of those taken to hospitals did not have life-threatening injuries. China's last fatal passenger airline accident occurred in November 2004, when a China Eastern commuter jet took off in frigid Inner Mongolia without de-icing and crashed shortly afterward into a nearby park, killing 55 people.

413,"New York (CNN) -- A man in his 60s attempted an armed robbery in New York City and fled to Maryland, where he allegedly robbed two hotels at gunpoint, led police on a short chase and died when his car left the road and crashed, authorities said Friday. The man was identified as a 63-year-old career criminal named Arthur Williams, CNN affiliate WABC reported. New York police said Williams tried to rob Sarar, an upscale clothing store on Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, Saturday evening while carrying a cane and wearing a nasal tube connected to an oxygen tank. The suspect fired three shots before fleeing the scene, police said. Early Sunday morning, Maryland State Police were alerted to an armed robbery in Hancock, Maryland, and a second about an hour later in Clear Spring, Maryland. A state trooper on DUI patrol was following a suspected drunken driver when dispatchers broadcast a description of the vehicle driven by the suspected robber. The description matched the vehicle he was following, so he attempted to pull the driver over. The chase lasted about 2 1/2 miles and reached a top speed of 120 mph, police said, ending when Williams's car went off the road and hit several fixed objects and a parked car. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The New York incident was recorded by a store surveillance camera, according to an advisory issued earlier Friday by the New York Police Department, which was seeking the public's assistance in the hunt for the would-be robber. Williams initially appeared to be shopping for clothing after entering the store, according to police. Sol Tezcan, the store manager said the man did not rouse suspicion and calmly asked for a pair of pants to match his jacket. Tezcan said that when he turned around looking for pants, the man pulled a gun from his waistband and demanded money from a nearby customer. The gunman fired one shot, missing the customer, who was fleeing the store. Tezcan said Williams then turned the gun on him, asking, ""You want one?"" He fired two shots in Tezcan's direction as he ran toward the back of the store, the manager said. ""I was not nervous,"" Tezcan said. ""It happened in three seconds."" Williams fled the scene in a black Cadillac CTS with Alabama license plates, the same car Maryland state police later encountered, according to police.

414,"(CNN) -- At least 200 structures have been destroyed and 1,100 damaged after a dam on an eastern Iowa lake failed, unleashing a torrent of floodwaters, a spokesman for the governor said Sunday. The Lake Delhi dam, about 45 miles north of Cedar Rapids, failed Saturday as a result of ""massive rain -- a very unusually high amount this season,"" according to Jim Flansburg, communications director for Gov. Chet Culver. It was unclear how many of the structures impacted by the ensuing floodwaters were residential homes, Flansburg said. Culver planned to tour the affected areas Sunday afternoon, helping set sandbags out to stave off the rising Maquoketa River. Culver told CNN Saturday that nearly 10 inches of rain had recently fallen in a 12-hour period in the area and was ""too much water for the dam to hold."" The roads on either side of the dam -- which were part of the cement dam's containment measures -- apparently gave out as a result of the rainfall, Flansburg said. Video on Saturday showed massive amounts of water violently gushing from the pool behind the dam into the Maquoketa below. Nearby homes and buildings were under water up to their eaves. No injuries were reported.","It's unclear how many of the affected structures are residential homes .

415,"(CNN) -- Floodwaters covering the Chicago area were receding Sunday, as damages surfaced and communities began the clean-up process. Ten towns in Cook County have declared their communities as disaster areas, said Dave Ramos, executive director for Cook County Emergency Management. Friday night's heavy rains hit Westchester and Melrose Park the hardest, filling some Cook County basements with up to four feet of water, Ramos said. He said he will recommend to the county's president that all of Cook be declared a disaster area Monday. Of the 50,000 ComEd customers who were without electricity Saturday morning, 3,000 remained without power Sunday, said Laura Micheli, a spokeswoman for the utility. ""There is still a lot of flooding obviously,"" Micheli said. ""In some areas they need to wait for water to recede before they're able to restore power."" The outages started at about 6 p.m. (7 p.m. ET) Friday night. There are no reports of missing people, fatalities or injuries to the Cook County 911 center, Ramos said. The National Weather Service predicted pleasant weather Sunday, but flood warnings remained for areas on the nearby Fox and Des Plaines rivers. The area hasn't had any storms since late Saturday morning, Micheli said.","10 towns in Cook County have declared their communities disaster areas .

416,"(CNN) -- Searchers looking for the airplane that slammed into the side of a tree-covered Alaskan mountainside earlier this month couldn't detect an emergency locator signal after the impact damaged the craft's transmitter, according to a federal report released on Wednesday. The National Transportation Safety Board issued a preliminary report about the August 9 accident that killed five people, including former Sen.Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and injured four others. ""No emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal was detected during the aerial search,"" the report said, ""Examination of the wreckage revealed that the ELT had separated from its mounting bracket during impact, and the antenna cable was found separated from the ELT."" Weather conditions at the time of the accident were ""not known,"" the report said, but Alaska Air National Guard rescuers were hampered by poor weather and terrain -- slogging for hours through rain, fog and wind to reach the rugged mountainside in southwestern Alaska. The closest weather reporting station, at Dillingham Airport, about 18 miles south of the accident site, reported light rain and mist in cloudy and overcast conditions, with winds gusting to more than 26 mph just 10 minutes after the accident took place. ""At the time of the accident, marginal visual meteorological conditions were reported at the Dillingham Airport,"" the report said. The four survivors included Willy Phillips Jr., 13. His father, former Stevens staffer Bill Phillips Sr., was among the five people killed in the crash. The other survivors were former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe and his 19-year-old son, Kevin, and Jim Moorhard of Alexandria, Virginia. Along with Stevens, 86, and Bill Phillips, the others who died were pilot Terry Smith, 62, of Eagle River, Alaska; Dana Tindall, 48, of Anchorage, Alaska; and Corey Tindall, 16, of Anchorage, Alaska. Autopsies on the five victims found the deaths were the result of blunt force trauma, injuries consistent with this type of crash, state officials said. The report said the de Havilland DHC-3T Otter -- a single-engine, turbine-powered, amphibious float-equipped craft -- ""sustained substantial damage"" when it crashed about 10 miles northeast of Aleknagik about 2:45 p.m. Alaska Daylight Time. it said the airplane was registered to and operated by General Communication Corporation in Anchorage and the flight ""originated from a GCI-owned remote fishing lodge on the southwest shoreline of Lake Nerka"" about 2:30 p.m. It was headed to a ""remote sport fishing camp on the banks of the Nushagak River, located about 52 miles southeast of the lodge."" No flight plan had been filed. A GCI representative said the pilot telephoned people at the camp to say the plane would arrive there, but a couple of hours later the plane had not arrived. ""The GCI lodge manager then initiated a phone and radio search to see if the airplane had diverted to Dillingham, Alaska or if it was en route back to the GCI lodge. Unable to locate the airplane, GCI lodge personnel initiated an aerial search along the pilot's anticipated route,"" the report said. Volunteers flying planes and helicopters joined in the search. About 8:05 p.m., air searchers spotted the wreckage ""along the anticipated flight route, about 900 feet above mean sea level in the Muklung Hills, in steep, heavily wooded terrain, about 19 miles southeast of the GCI lodge."" Searchers reached the accident site by helicopter and ""confirmed that the pilot and four passengers died at the scene, and four passengers sustained serious injuries."" More rescue crew members were prevented from reaching the site at the time by ""poor weather and dark night conditions"" But the next morning, Coast Guard and Air National Guard helicopters evacuated everyone from the site.","Report on August 9 crash says searchers detected no locator signal .

417,"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Mechanical failures caused a North Korean air force plane to lose direction before crashing in northeastern China earlier this week, state media quoted Chinese authorities as saying Thursday. China's official Xinhua news agency said that Pyongyang has apologized to Beijing for the incident and the two sides have ""reached a consensus on dealing with the aftermath."" The plane went down Tuesday at Lagu township in Fushun county, killing the pilot and destroying one home on the ground. The crash site in Liaoning province is about 200 kilometers (120 miles) away from a North Korean air base in the border town of Sinuiju, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. An employee at Songgang Iron Mine, a company near the crash site, told CNN Wednesday that armed police officers and special forces agents immediately cordoned off the area after the plane went down. Photographs of the wreckage purportedly taken by an eyewitness have been circulating on Chinese websites, showing the North Korean air force emblem on the fuselage beneath the tail of the aircraft. Military enthusiasts online have identified it as a Russian-built MiG jet but differed on the specific model, with some calling it a MiG-21 fighter and others claiming it to be a MiG-15 trainer. Xinhua's latest report did not give details on the plane. Yonhap had earlier quoted unnamed sources in South Korea as saying the plane's pilot may have been trying to defect from North Korea to Russia. Chinese commentators had speculated that the plane may have run out of fuel.","Chinese authorities say mechanical failures caused the pilot to lose direction .

418,"(CNN) -- Seven people, including six Israelis, are feared dead after an Israeli helicopter crashed in Romania on Monday during a joint military exercise, the Romanian Defense ministry said. The control center for the joint exercises, known as Blue Sky 2010, lost radio contact with the Israeli CH-53 helicopter about 3:20 p.m. (8:20 a.m. ET), the ministry said in a statement. Search-and-rescue operations began immediately, using a Romanian medical helicopter and two Israeli helicopters, the statement said. About 5:45 p.m. (10:45 a.m. ET), teams found the wreckage of the helicopter in the Fundata-Zarnesti area, near Brasov in central Romania, the defense ministry said. ""So far, the circumstances of the accident and the crew situation remain unknown."" Defense Minister Gabriel Oprea has ordered a commission to the site to investigate the crash, the ministry said. Israel Defense Forces said the aircraft was carrying four pilots, two mechanics and a member of the Romanian Air Force. The Israeli air force is sending medical, rescue and investigative teams to the scene, a military statement said. The crash site was in a remote area at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters (about 6,560 feet) in the mountains, according to the defense ministry. Fog was preventing helicopters from flying to the site Monday night. Authorities said six ambulances were waiting a few kilometers away. The exercises, scheduled from July 18 through Thursday, are aimed at training low-altitude aircraft crews in search-and-rescue operations and medical evacuations, according to the statement. A CH-53 helicopter made an emergency landing July 18 after experiencing technical problems, the defense ministry said. The problem was fixed, and it took off and landed safely. Journalist Cosmin Stan contributed to this report.","The crash occurred during a joint exercise, defense ministry says .

419,"(CNN) -- A 15-year-old girl died and two other people were hospitalized with severe injuries after an amusement park ride in Barcelona, Spain, broke in midair, a city spokeswoman said. A young boy who was on the ride suffered minor injuries, but walked away from the twisted metal on his own, Barcelona spokeswoman Rosa Diaz said. The names of the victims have not been announced. The mechanical arm of ""El Pendulo"" (The Pendulum) broke and the basket carrying the teens fell on top of the ride known as ""The Golden Mine,"" said Sara Jaurriete, director of the Tibidabo amusement park. The park's website describes El Pendulo as ""the ultimate free fall and the first of its kind in Spain."" The ride has a ""long articulated arm where passengers are taken up to 38 meters (124 ft). From here, you are dropped in a free fall reaching 100kph (60 mph) in 2.8 seconds. Once you reach the bottom, the arm takes you through a 50-metre arc,"" the park's website says. The Pendulum has been in operation for the past four years, and it is billed as one of the park's main attractions. About 4,000 visitors were in the park when the accident happened Saturday evening, Jaurriete said. The park will be closed on Sunday as an investigation begins.","A ride basket breaks in midair, falling onto another ride .

420,"Beijing, China (CNN) -- The death toll from the devastating mudslide in China's northwestern Gansu province rose slightly to 1,254 Monday, a day after the country paused for three minutes in memory of those who perished. Another 490 people are still missing a week after torrential rains triggered the mudslides on July 8, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. At 10 a.m. Sunday, Chinese President Hu Jintao and other top leaders paid a silent tribute ahead of a party meeting. At the Dongjie Village in hardest-hit Zhouqu county, more than 5,000 rescuers and villagers stood still atop mudslide debris with their heads bowed, Xinhua said. Large-scale national displays of mourning are rare in China, though the country designated three days of mourning after a massive 2008 earthquake in Sichuan. The country also had a day of mourning after a quake in Yushu earlier this year. China has been drenched by heavy rains and floods since the end of May. More than 400 million people have been affected. On July 8, heavy rains caused the side of a mountain broke off in the night and tear through remote Zhouqu county, burying some homes and ripping others apart. The path of the mudslide is covered in three to four stories of rock and mud. By Sunday, crews had cleared out roads, allowing for the delivery of relief supplies. Power has been restored to about 76 percent of homes, and wells have been dug to supply more water, Xinhua said.","NEW: The death toll rises slightly to 1,254, with 490 missing .

421,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Oil left on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico is breaking down naturally now that the flow of crude has been cut off beneath the surface, a Coast Guard admiral said Sunday after touring the scene. Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft said the remnants of Tropical Storm Bonnie did little to affect the oil slick, which is breaking down ""very quickly."" ""The storm itself was not that significant,"" Zukunft told CNN after an aerial survey of the northern Gulf on Sunday. ""We've had nine days of no new oil being released, so what we're seeing is the remnants of oil that was released nine days ago."" BP crews managed to temporarily cap the undersea well at the heart of the three-month-old disaster on June 15. But efforts to close off the gusher permanently by drilling a relief well were delayed by the storm, which forced the ships involved in the process to evacuate the area. Those ships have returned to the area since the storm, he told reporters Sunday night. Zukunft told reporters that he saw only one large patch of emulsified oil, about 12 miles off Grand Isle, Louisiana, during his six-hour aerial tour. No oil could be seen in Louisiana's Lake Borgne, Lake Pontchartrain or Chandeleur Sound, while only a light sheen was visible in other parts of the Gulf. ""The oil is basically approaching the end of its life cycle,"" he said. Oil had gushed from the ruptured well for nearly three months after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20, leaving 11 workers dead. Officials have said a relief well is the only permanent solution to the disaster, which saw as much as 60,000 barrels (2.5 million gallons) of crude spewing into the Gulf every day. Ships critical for drilling the well started evacuating Thursday and returning Saturday afternoon, once Bonnie lost her punch after crossing southern Florida. The weather forced officials to temporarily scale back efforts to search beneath the surface for leaking oil and permanently plug the leak, drawing some criticism from local officials that the federal government was overreacting to the storm. But retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who is leading the federal government's response to the spill, emphasized the need to move and protect equipment before a storm. He said told reporters Friday that he was still ""haunted"" by the sight of submerged school buses ""that could not be used for the evacuation"" after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005. ""We're going to be playing a cat-and-mouse game for the remainder of the hurricane season,"" Allen said. Sunday, Allen said officials were examining new oil deposits on the shoreline created by the storm, and booms that were in sensitive marsh areas caused damage during the storm and may need to be removed before another surge happens. But with the storm's passing, work on the relief well is scheduled to continue, he said. And by August 1, he said crews could begin pumping drilling ""mud"" into the ruptured well to force oil back into the reservoir below -- a process known as a ""static kill.""

422,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN)  -- A 15-year-old boy who was burned over 65 percent of his body in October when he was set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers, was released from the hospital Tuesday, officials said. Michael Brewer was discharged from the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center, spokeswoman Lorraine Nelson said in a written statement. Doctors and Brewer's mother, Valerie, will speak to reporters Wednesday, Nelson said. Brewer's family is headed not to their Deerfield Beach, Florida, home, but to an undisclosed location, a source close to the family said. Nelson said the family had requested privacy before the teen's discharge. Brewer suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body in the October 12 incident, the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman, has said. He told CNN's Tony Harris last month that the teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries. ""Michael's still got a lot of major surgery ahead of him, a lot of rehabilitation and therapy,"" Schulman said. ""... the recovery is lifelong. This is truly a life-changing event."" The hospital released some photographs of Brewer taken Tuesday morning in the hospital's rehabilitation unit. In the pictures his burns are clearly visible. Three teens -- Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, and Jesus Mendez, 16 -- are accused of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in what police said was a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. All three teens are charged as adults with one count of attempted murder. Each has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, each could face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis poured alcohol over him. Bent allegedly encouraged the attack, police said. Brewer jumped into a pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames. Authorities have said Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a ""bad decision."" Valerie Brewer said last month that her son's treatment at times has been excruciatingly painful. Physical therapy, she said, is ""incredibly painful. He almost cries because it's so painful. He's burned badly on the backs of his knees and every time he moves his knee, it pulls, and if it's healing, it pulls the scab and it cracks and it starts to bleed."" The 13-year-old brother of one of the accused youths made a public statement in November. Jeremy Jarvis said he wanted to ""express his deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family"" and added he was praying for Brewer's recovery. Jeremy Jarvis was arrested as a juvenile after the incident and spent about 30 days in juvenile detention. However, prosecutors have not filed charges against him and are still determining how to proceed. He could still be charged, as prosecutors have 90 days from his arrest to decide whether to move forward with the case. Jeremy Jarvis' attorney, Stephen Melnick, said it appeared the younger Jarvis was only a witness to the attack. Valerie Brewer said she was heartbroken when she learned her son's attackers may have included teens who they knew. ""But we don't focus on that,"" she said last month.

423,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Much has been made of the more than quarter-million homes lost to Katrina along the Gulf Coast, and with good reason. Ride through almost any neighborhood that was hit and even five years later you can see the skeletons of buildings, or empty lots covered with weeds.   But to truly grasp the impact of this storm, you also have to consider who lived in those homes: Working families; the people who make the ports, the fishing business, the oil industry and the tourist attractions work. Florine Jenkins is one of them. Living in the 9th Ward of New Orleans, she has made a living as a housekeeper for many years.   She is African-American, and old enough to tell tales of sitting in the balcony that was restricted for blacks at the city auditorium, while she watched white teens on the main floor below bopping to the music of Little Richard and Fats Domino.   She fled Katrina and returned to find her home underneath a neighbor's house. And like many others here, she had no idea how to navigate the bewildering maze of paperwork involved in rebuilding; forms for insurance companies, government programs, contractors, utility companies, banks, mortgage brokers, on and on it went. ""Did you have any idea how to deal with all that?"" I asked her. She smiled, shook her head, and gave one of the longest single-word answers I've heard. ""Nooooooooooooo."" Then she met Nikki Najioli. Nikki works for Build Now, is middle-aged, white, looks like the businesswomen she is, and spends her days helping others sort out such problems. In a strange way, it helps that she lost her own home and fully understands the thicket of questions that followed the storm. ""Do you tear down your house? Do you put it back together? If you put it back together do you have to elevate it? If you are going to elevate it, how high are you going to elevate it? And where's that money going to come from? It was just so overwhelming and even today it's still overwhelming."" Calming down the fears, and restoring the confidence of people who are trying to rebuild, is what Build Now is all about. Simply put, it is a nonprofit construction company that offers an array of modestly priced home designs, an endless supply of free advice to anyone trying to build, and a commitment to bring the working class neighborhoods back. ""This is the living room area,"" Ben Seymour, the construction manager for Build Now, says as he shows me around one model under construction in a neighborhood that saw eight feet of water. The house soars high in the air upon pilings driven deep into the earth; a lovely, modest home with soft colors, elegant lines, and a style that echoes the surviving homes around it. The homes are made without eaves that a storm could snatch at to tear off the roof. The front porch is anchored to the house much more robustly than as customary, so that it too can stand firm. And most importantly, Seymour says, the basic design of the house can be expanded or contracted to fit the needs and wallets of folks who are watching their money. ""You can size it down. It still gives you a big open feel, and it's built to what you're going to use."" So in every way, these really are working class family homes? ""Absolutely. Absolutely,"" he says. ""They fit the budget."" Even though this is a nonprofit endeavor, and Build Now does try to help homebuyers find financing, this is not a giveaway program. Each person must pay a fair price. Out on the porch I run into Nikki again, looking out at the quiet neighborhood where a few restoration projects seem to be underway. ""How much do these places cost?"" I ask. ""On average,"" she says, ""about $150,000."" Still, for a great many folks, the help they have received from Build Now and other groups which are helping neighborhoods rebuild, is priceless.   Florine Jenkins beams as she shows me the rest of her new home in the 9th Ward, now filled with family photos, furniture, and other personal items. I ask her if she thinks, in retrospect, that she could have pulled off rebuilding on her own given enough time. Her answer is emphatic: No way. ""I didn't know nothing about nothing like that. Build Now took care of everything."" It is a heartfelt testimony to success: Once Katrina left her with nothing but questions. Now, once again, she has a home.","New Orleans residents still trying to rebuild homes hit hard by Hurricane Katrina .

424,"(CNN) -- The ambulance sped toward Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from the New Orleans airport, overrun with refugees from a drowned city. A mother pregnant with twins screamed from labor pains. Robbie Prepas, a nurse and midwife who struggles with car sickness, tried to stay focused. The babies weren't going to wait. Five minutes into the ride, Prepas delivered the first twin with no problem. But then, she saw two feet beginning to emerge -- a breech baby. Panic set in. ""Don't push! Don't push! Don't push!"" Today, five years after delivering those twins in the midst of the chaos that Katrina wreaked, Prepas dwells -- not on the death and destruction that was so well-documented -- but on the life that emerged. She and her team delivered 20 healthy babies amid the storm's aftermath in a two-week period that ""changed my life."" ""It's one of those events in America that we should never forget."" Prepas, now 58, has traveled the world with organizations like Save the Children and UNICEF. She went to Ghana, Namibia and Zimbabwe in the 1990s to teach midwives in those African countries how best to deal with emergencies. A year before Katrina, she traveled to Afghanistan with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to figure out why so many mothers and babies were dying at a hospital in Kabul. As Hurricane Katrina spun toward the Gulf, the urge to help came natural. Based out of San Diego, Prepas was a member of California's Disaster Medical Assistance Team, a group of about 30 physicians, general practitioners, nurses, nurse practitioners and other specialists. They were told to head to Louis Armstrong International Airport, along with teams from Oregon and Washington. Katrina had swept ashore, and the levee had been breached. ""I had never in my life seen such a disaster as I had in New Orleans,"" Prepas says. ""And, believe me, I've seen the worst of everything."" At the airport, thousands of people milled about. Elderly patients from nursing homes had been dropped off, without medications or even adult diapers. Electricity was out, and there was no running water. ""There were two policemen and two security guards,"" Prepas says. ""There was no organization. We didn't know who to answer to. ... Nobody was in charge."" Prepas and the other 89 medical professionals swung into action. They set up three tents at the front of the airport -- green, for walking wounded and pregnant women; yellow, for slightly more serious conditions; red, for critical patients. ""By the end of two weeks, we had screened and triaged more than 20,000 people."" Prepas was stationed in the green tent, and, at one point, was caring for 50 prenatal patients. She was sleeping on a luggage carousel when the first woman in labor arrived. Prepas set up a privacy sheet in the tent and prepared a cot. The first baby to be born at the airport was healthy. ""His name was David,"" she says. On the third day, U.S. military personnel arrived to establish order amid the pandemonium. On that same day, the woman pregnant with twins was brought to the airport. Prepas still doesn't know how the woman got there. ""She was 8 centimeters dilated, and she was ready to deliver."" The woman's husband and two sons were at the convention center with no idea she was in labor, or where she had gone. All Prepas knew was: ""I had to get her out."" Frantically searching for an ambulance, Prepas found a group of paramedics who had driven more than 500 miles from Nashville, Tennessee. ""Guys, you've got to drive me to Baton Rouge,"" Prepas barked. ""Now!"" The paramedics radioed a hospital in Baton Rouge to let them know they were bringing a woman in labor with twins. The two baby boys had other plans. Both boys were delivered en route. The second child, who came out feet first, was discolored. He received oxygen for the next 30 minutes, until they arrived. Two more weeks passed before that mother and her babies were reunited with the rest of their family. Prepas' time in New Orleans affected her profoundly on so many different levels. Prepas has curtailed most of her overseas humanitarian missions; she now flies mostly to places in need within the U.S. -- the quake in Haiti being an exception. A member of the White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood, Prepas has used the experience to bring attention to rising maternal mortality rates inside the United States, one of the worst in the industrialized world. In 1982, eight women died per 100,000 live births in the U.S.; now, the figure has jumped to 17 per 100,000, largely due to lack of health care for the nation's poorest women, according to the White Ribbon Alliance. ""Women are going to have babies out of place,"" especially during disaster, she says. ""We have to be prepared for that."" One of the toughest things about her job in New Orleans was delivering the babies -- and then walking away. ""Life goes on after an emergency,"" she says. ""I never stayed in touch with them ... but I think about it all the time. It drives me to keep wanting to do all this stuff.

425,"Washington (CNN) -- The State Department says long-term recovery and reconstruction efforts in flood-ravaged Pakistan could take ""many, many months, if not years."" ""The sheer impact still needs to be assessed, but will certainly be staggering,"" said Dan Feldman, deputy special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, at a press briefing on Monday . Feldman, who surveyed the destruction by helicopter last week with a congressional delegation led by Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, described the damage as ""epic and devastating."" ""Agricultural fields, under water,"" said Feldman. ""Roads and bridges, under water; roads continuously disrupted by water, so impossible to move people or food or supplies out; power plants literally under water."" Feldman said that in addition to the obvious need for immediate relief for what the United Nations describes as millions of displaced flood victims, the U.N. and other international donors will also need to focus on long-term recovery and reconstruction. ""We're looking at ways that we can redirect already existing funds through Kerry-Lugar-Berman and others to meet the needs of flood victims as soon as possible,"" Feldman said, ""so programs for livelihood, for clinics, rebuilding schools, infrastructure that we had already planned, which can be redirected to get to flood victims as quickly as possible."" Feldman was referring to the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 sponsored by Kerry, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, and Rep. Howard Berman, D-California. The law commits $7.5 billion in assistance to Pakistan over five years and is earmarked for ""improving the living conditions of the people of Pakistan through strengthening democracy and the rule of law, sustainable economic development and combating terrorism and extremism,"" according to the law's sponsors. Feldman described ""a real galvanizing moment"" last week, when greater amounts of contributions from the international community began to pour in. ""We've seen over $700 million pledged, including our own $150 million commitment, from over 30 countries, and an additional $300 million in as yet undefined commitments from a range of other countries,"" he said. Feldman said U.S. helicopters have evacuated close to 8,000 people and delivered more than 1.6 million pounds of relief supplies. Deaths are still relatively low at this point, ""at about the 1,500, 1,600 mark,"" said Feldman, but officials are concerned about communicable illnesses breaking out among the millions of displaced victims. The World Health Organization announced Sunday more than 200,000 cases of acute diarrhea have been diagnosed, and there are more than 250,000 cases of disease including scabies. Water levels remain quite high, Feldman said, though some are starting to recede. Broken dikes have aggravated flooding in some areas, he said.","Impact ""will be staggering,"" says State Department official .

426,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two U.S. Navy MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters arrived Saturday to assist with humanitarian and rescue efforts in flood-ravaged Pakistan, which canceled celebrations of its 63rd birthday. A statement from the U.S. State Department says the two aircraft are part of the contingent of 19 helicopters, ordered to Pakistan on Wednesday by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Seven of the 19 craft are now in the country. One other MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter and four U.S. Marine Corps CH-53E helicopters arrived earlier this week. Twelve Marine CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters will arrive over the next few days. Since August 5, U.S. military helicopters have rescued more than 3,500 people and transported more than 412,000 pounds of emergency relief supplies, according to the State Department. One-fifth of Pakistan -- which is about the size of Florida -- has been flooded in relentless monsoon rains, the United Nations says. Nearly 1,400 people have died and 875,000 homes have either washed away or are damaged, according to Pakistan's Disaster Authority. Millions more are still at peril as the bloated Indus River is cresting this weekend in parts of Sindh province. In some areas, the Indus has expanded from its usual width of one mile to 12 miles. Homes, crops, trees, livestock, entire villages and towns have been transformed into vast lakes. The worst floods since Pakistan's creation have disrupted the lives of about 20 million people, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said Saturday. Surrounded by a tragedy of epic proportions, Pakistanis canceled Saturday's celebrations of independence, hard won from the British in 1947. They might have otherwise attended parades, burst firecrackers and waved the green and white flag proudly. Instead, President Asif Ali Zardari, under fire for a perceived lack of government response, toured flood-ravaged Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the north, where the crisis began more than two weeks ago. He urged Pakistanis to remember the afflicted. ""The best way to celebrate the Independence Day this year is to reach out to the victims and help them to help themselves,"" he said, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan. ""I stand with you and the people of Pakistan stand with you as well, in your hour of trial,"" he told flood victims in Seraiki. ""Do not lose hope as the entire nation stands with you."" Gilani said that even some religious events connected to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan were canceled. He said money that might have been spent on Iftar, the feast that breaks the daily fast between sunrise and sundown, should be used to alleviate suffering. Meanwhile, the United Nations said Secretary General Ban Ki-moon intends to visit Pakistan Sunday and see the devastation firsthand. His trip comes as U.N. and other humanitarian agencies are racing against time to prevent more death and suffering. ""Relief supplies must reach women, men and children as soon as possible, in order to avoid further death caused by waterborne diseases and food shortages,"" said Martin Mogwanja, the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator for Pakistan. ""The death toll has so far been relatively low compared with other major natural disasters, and we want to keep it that way,"" he said. Pakistan emergency officials predicted the second wave of floodwaters gushing down the Indus River could reach the southern town of Sukkar by Saturday evening. Hundreds of thousands of people living along the Indus could be stranded, along with the tens of thousands stranded by the first wave, said Lt. Cmdr. Jawad Khawaja of the Pakistani navy. Many residents have ignored government warnings to evacuate the area, causing a big concern, Khawaja said. ""The time to act is now -- this is a disaster of unimaginable proportions,"" said Nilofer Bakhtiar, head of the Pakistan Red Crescent Society. Thousands of flood victims huddled in sludgy camps or in jam-packed public buildings. Others slept under the stars next to the cows, sheep and goats they managed to rescue from rising waters. But when they might be able to return to dry lands at home remained a big question. Pakistan's monsoon season is only half way over and more rain is on the way.

427,"(CNN) -- The United States' National Transportation Safety Board said it is sending a team to help the government of Saudi Arabia investigate the crash of a Lufthansa cargo plane in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday. NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman is sending a senior air safety investigator, flight operations specialists, an aircraft systems specialist and technical advisers from the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing, according to an NTSB statement. Lufthansa Cargo said the MD-11 plane was traveling from Frankfurt, Germany, when it crashed at 11:38 a.m. (4:38 a.m. ET). Lufthansa said a team of experts from the company was on its way to Riyadh. The plane crashed while landing at King Khalid International Airport, the official Saudi Press Agency of Saudi Arabia reported. A company statement said the plane caught fire and was extensively damaged, but the blaze was extinguished. The craft had been carrying 80 tons of cargo. Lufthansa said both pilots -- who evacuated the aircraft down the emergency slide -- were injured. They were contacted by phone and were being treated in a hospital. It was not clear what freight was on the aircraft and whether customers were affected.","NEW: The cargo plane crashed while landing at Riyadh airport .

428,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN)  -- A passenger plane crashed into a shallow waterway and broke in two after overshooting the runway in a remote area of Indonesia's eastern Papua province on Tuesday, injuring 78 people on board. Bambang Ervan, a spokesman for Indonesia's Transportation Ministry, said  investigators to the airport in  the coastal town of Manokwari where the Merpati Nusantara Airlines Boeing 737-300 had been attempting to land. There were reports that bad weather may have been a factor. The injured, many of whom suffered fractures, were taken to hospitals in the area. In all, the plane was carrying 103 passengers, including three children and three infants. Ervan said the aircraft bounced on the runway during landing, skidded and plunged into a nearby canal. Merpati, a cash-strapped state-owned airline which is in the process of upgrading its aging fleet, flies many of the more remote routes across Indonesia. Last year Merpati suffered two plane crashes in Papua. In July, a Merpati flight lost its front wheels as it took of from the town of Biak. A month later, another flight -- a Twin Otter aircraft -- crashed, killing 16 people on board. Air accidents are not infrequent in Papua, a mountainous area in the easternmost part of Indonesia. Two cargo planes and several smaller aircraft also crashed in the province last year. Indonesia has made efforts in recent years to improve its safety record. Last year the European Union's Safety Commission lifted a ban on four Indonesian carriers. In Hong Kong, Tuesday, a Cathy Pacific flight from Surabaya in Indonesia made an emergency landing injuring eight people. Flight 780 from Surabaya, Indonesia, was carrying 309 passengers and 13 crew members, Cathay Pacific CEO Tony Tyler said at a news conference. Passengers and crew deplaned through the Airbus 330's evacuation slides. The injured were taken to the territory's Princess Margaret Hospital. Tyler said a full investigation will follow but engine trouble may have played a part in the incident. The north runway at the Hong Kong International Airport was closed for almost three hours after the emergency landing.","Merpati airlines jet crashes into canal after skidding on landing in Papua .

429,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A coroner's investigator dismissed online speculation that the pneumonia deaths of actress Brittany Murphy and her husband, Simon Monjack, may both have been related to viral mold inside their Los Angeles home. ""There were no indicators that it was from mold,"" Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said Monday. Murphy, 32, and Monjack, 39, died five months apart in the same bedroom of the home they shared with the actress' mother, Sharon Murphy, in Hollywood Hills. The preliminary autopsy concluded that Monjack's death May 23 was caused by acute pneumonia and severe anemia, ""just like Brittany,"" Winter said last week. Murphy died December 20 from a combination of pneumonia, an iron deficiency and multiple drug intoxication, a coroner said. The drugs involved were legal and are used to treat respiratory infections, according to an autopsy. Winter said Monjack, his mother-in-law and their lawyer all talked to him about a possible mold problem in the home during the investigation into Brittany's death. Murphy, however, issued a statement Monday saying that she has ""never been personally asked by the Coroner or anyone from the Health Department to come and inspect my home for mold."" Winter called that ""an absolute lie,"" but Murphy's publicist, Roger Neal, stood by the statement, calling it ""100 percent factual."" The home apparently was tested by ""a well-respected company"" for dangerous mold just two months before Murphy's death, according to Neal. ""Simon Monjack received the report and assured Brittany and Sharon Murphy that there was no mold danger and it was safe to stay in the house,"" Neal said. Monjack, a British screenwriter, married Murphy in 2007. She was an often bubbly, free-spirited actress who appeared in films such as ""Clueless,"" ""8 Mile,"" ""Don't Say a Word"" and ""Girl, Interrupted."" She also lent her voice to animated works, including the movie ""Happy Feet"" -- in which she also sang -- and a regular role on the animated TV series ""King of the Hill.""","NEW: Inspection found no mold in home before Murphy's death .

430,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- A towing vessel struck an oil well in the Barataria Waterway off the southeastern Louisiana coast on Tuesday, causing the well to emit oil and natural gas into Barataria Bay, the Coast Guard said in a news release. Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the government's point man for the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, said there was a sheen around the platform, and vapor that's probably a combination of gas and water was emanating from the well, called C-117. Kyle Plotkin, a spokesman for Gov. Bobby Jindal, described the well as ""orphaned."" He said it had been owned by Cedyco Corp. of Houston but was declared abandoned by the state in November 2008. Plotkin said the state does not own the well and added that the designation does not absolve Cedyco of responsibility for the well. The tug vessel Pere Ana C was pushing the dredge barge Captain Buford Berry when it hit the wellhead, the Coast Guard said. Jindal and Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft, the federal on-scene coordinator for the Gulf spill, and other officials surveyed the damage by helicopter, according to a statement from the governor's office. ""The Coast Guard's overflight this morning confirmed the pipeline/well-head is discharging a mist of orange and brown oil about 100 feet in air,"" Jindal said. ""This is the same thing we viewed on our flight to the well today. The Coast Guard does not have a specific flow rate for the well determined yet, although there have been early reports that there is natural gas and mud mixed in with oil coming from the well."" Jefferson Parish Councilman Chris Roberts said that while oil was gushing from the well in 6 feet of water, it was too dangerous to get close enough to estimate how much oil was leaking out. However, Roberts said he doesn't ""expect it is going to be a huge problem to contain it or cap"" the leak, because ""it isn't uncommon."" ""Until we know the condition of it, the quickness of plugging the well is uncertain,"" said Capt. Ed Cubanski, chief of incident management for the Coast Guard's Eighth District in New Orleans. The Coast Guard has tapped the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which the federal government makes available for natural resource damage assessments. Environmental Safety and Health personnel were on the scene to clean up, as well as the Coast Guard Gulf Strike Team from Mobile, Alabama. Allen said response crews were able to take advantage of the ""significant resources"" -- vessels of opportunity, skimming equipment and boom -- already in the area to work on the Gulf oil spill. He said C-117 was surrounded by boom. ""The Coast Guard is also beginning oil spill response actions at the site -- deploying hard and sorbent boom both north and south of the oil release,"" Jindal said. ""Air assets have also been deployed to ensure response personnel are not working in a flammable atmosphere. Once the leak source is secured, the Coast Guard will ramp up their skimming operations to collect free-floating oil. ""We know this well is close to important marshes in the Barataria Bay area, so it is important that this well is cut off quickly and the oil is contained and removed,"" he said. A safety zone has been established 2 miles around the site to protect vessels and mariners from the hazards associated with the release, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard is investigating the incident, which happened about 1 a.m. Tuesday.

431,"(CNN) -- The identities of two women involved in a horrific car crash in Arizona last week were mixed up, with one family receiving news that their daughter had died when in fact she was undergoing treatment for her injuries while another family kept watch at her side for six days. Officials with St. Joseph's Medical Center and the Arizona Department of Public Safety apologized for the mistake Monday, saying they were ""acting on the best information"" available at the time of notification. Marlena Cantu, 21, was killed in the crash July 18 when the SUV in which she was riding blew a tire and rolled several times. Four others were in the vehicle: a male driver and male occupant, and two other female occupants -- one of whom was 19-year-old Abby Guerra, described by friends and family as Cantu's best friend. The five young people were driving back to Phoenix from a trip to Disneyland in California. ""As doctors struggled to save this patient's life, we could not readily tell the patient's identification,"" Suzanne Pfister, vice president for external affairs at St. Joseph's, told a news conference Monday. ""We interviewed family members that evening and asked for any discernible information that could help us make that positive identification,"" such as bone breaks, scars or other marks. ""From the information that was provided us on that evening, we believed the patient was Marlena Cantu,"" Pfister said. ""DPS communicated that information to the family."" Guerra's family, meanwhile, was told she was dead. Pfister said the mix-up was revealed Saturday when the medical examiner compared dental records and determined the patient -- whom the Cantu family had been praying for at her bedside as she underwent multiple surgeries -- to be Guerra. ""We know this is an extraordinarily challenging situation and our hearts and our prayers go out to both families,"" Pfister said. Sgt. Kevin Wood, a spokesman for DPS, described a ""chaotic situation"" in the emergency room the night of the wreck as the hospital received all four trauma patients from the collision scene. At least one person had been ejected from the SUV. ""(Authorities) tried for quite some time -- something close to five hours -- to figure out who this one female patient was,"" Wood said, emphasizing it was not a determination that was made within a matter of minutes. Pfister said the injuries to Guerra were so severe that she was unrecognizable to family and friends. She said the hospital, which treats about 3,000 trauma patients a year, does not conduct fingerprinting or take dental impressions in an emergency situation ""because the overwhelming emphasis is on saving the patient's life."" Nancy Colon, a friend of the Cantus, told HLN's ""Prime News"" Monday night that the family is ""heartbroken."" Colon said the family was taken into a room at the hospital on Saturday and told that the dental records taken from the female victim at the morgue did not match Guerra's. They were then questioned about the number of Marlena Cantu's ear piercings, her molars and past surgeries. Cantu had her appendix removed in elementary school, Colon said the hospital officials were told. ""They checked the girl in the ICU and she didn't have a scar,"" she said. The family was then told, ""I'm sorry, but that's not your daughter,"" according to Colon. Pfister declined to provide information about Guerra's condition Monday, citing the family's request. ""Our focus is on healing Abby,"" she said. The tragic mix-up is similar to another incident in 2006. The family of 22-year-old Laura VanRyn spent five weeks at the bedside of a woman they believed to be her daughter as she struggled to recover from injuries sustained in a car wreck that killed five others. When she awoke from a coma and was asked her name, she replied, ""Whitney Cerak,"" an 18-year-old who was believed to have been among those killed in the wreck. The two women had blond hair and similar body types.","The identities of two women in a deadly car wreck were mixed up .

432,"(CNN) -- The blowout is stopped. The oil disaster that began with an explosion 100 days ago has not ended by any means. But we seem to be seeing a murky ending to the beginning of the crisis. We have an enormous amount of floating oil, and Gulf waters polluted by oil and dispersant. Most estimates range from 2 million to 4 million barrels (84 million to 168 million gallons). The higher end would make it the largest unintended release of oil ever. (In 1991, Saddam Hussein's army intentionally released about 400 to 500 million gallons into the Persian Gulf to slow American troops.) Added to the Gulf of Mexico's troubles: about 2 million gallons of dispersant, a major intentional pollution event in itself. What now? As a naturalist, I'd say the wildlife effects remain hard to grasp. The damage to people is most easily observable, best quantified and perhaps even most acute. Regionally there's been further damage to Louisiana marshes already assaulted by decades of channel-cutting, shipping, water direction, erosion and sinkage. For resident wildlife, undersea oil and dispersant endangers countless sea creatures -- from plankton to whale sharks to dolphins and whales -- including reefs and the eggs and larvae of corals, fishes, crabs and oysters. Watch a talk by Carl Safina at TED.com . Of hemispheric importance are creatures that range widely but funnel through the Gulf to migrate or to breed. Two of the most important breeders are the world's most endangered sea turtle -- the Kemp's Ridley -- and the giant bluefin tuna, one of the most overfished of the world's giant ocean fishes. Migrants include millions of shorebirds, ducks and geese; herons and egrets; gannets, loons, terns, skimmers and other seabirds; peregrine falcons, ospreys and Gulf-crossing songbirds that often land exhausted on beaches and marshes. How many of these creatures, and what proportion of their populations, were damaged or spared, no one can say. Every oiled carcass found may suggest 10 to 100 undetected deaths. But it's also true that at this point -- with much of the oil yet to go somewhere -- there remain numerous clean-looking pelicans, gleaming gulls, and immaculate egrets along Gulf shores and marshes. People, though, have taken deep and immediate hits. Closures have meant an end to fishing, cessation of a way of life and of the way thousands of people understand who they are. Some may say the closures are artificial, that there are still plenty of fish, probably safe to eat. Others say the seafood safety is unreliable, and that, anyway, future consumer confidence is the most important thing to preserve. There's truth to both sides. The mere tainting of beaches has been enough to send beachgoers fleeing to other destinations, creating a real-estate implosion, hordes of refunded deposits, halted construction and thousands of service jobs lost. Nationally, we're all connected by the loss to the nation's seafood supply and by taxpayer funded government expenses related to agencies such as the Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as lost attention on other issues, and added unemployment costs that won't be covered by BP. No one knows whether the seafood and tourism and fisheries will be clean and healthy again next year or in a decade. We should be willing to learn some lessons. One is that this catastrophe wasn't just an accident. It was the result of reckless corner-cutting by the oil company and scandalously compromised oversight by the government. As U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, observed, ""BP appears to have made multiple decisions for economic reasons that increased the danger of a catastrophic well failure."" The compromised oversight included the Minerals Management Service failing to require a backup shutdown system required in much of the rest of the world, failing to require offshore drillers to file plans to deal with major oil spills and specifically allowing BP to drill without a detailed environmental analysis. The George W. Bush administration gave top Interior Department jobs to former lobbyists of the fossil fuel industry. Now the inspector general finds that Interior had ""a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity."" Another lesson: Preparedness is near zero. The only two things responders could quickly muster were booms that can't handle open water, and dispersants. But dispersants sink oil, defeating the idea behind booms, polluting much more water, making the oil more widely toxic to marine life and making it impossible to recover or clean up. Absent preparedness, BP and other companies responding to the spill made stuff up as they went; during weeks of blundering, hare-brained schemes like using shredded tires and golf balls to ""top kill"" the well, and fabricating new slap-dab caps and domes that didn't work. Meanwhile people sent their hair clippings to the Gulf. A comedy of horrors. That is not a response plan. Obviously, reforms are needed. Rig regulations should now require that the best equipment and procedures are used. To eliminate guesswork and argument, these procedures must be specified and quantified. For instance, blowout preventers should have a specified number of valves for drilling in a particular range of depths, all spelled out as requirements. Further, there should be explicit checklists and decision trees. If the driller detects a possible problem, the operation must be shut down; they must not retain the option of arguing about whether it's probably OK to keep going. A culture of safety and best practices must replace the culture of risk. We should never again be subjected to the comment, ""We've never tried this at this depth."" It's as if, after the house is on fire, they set about devising and then building a truck capable of spraying water. With all the contracting companies servicing thousands of rigs, you'd think the oil giants would have, say, two or three pieces of equipment in a warehouse somewhere capable of stopping and controlling a blowout at one of their wells -- and capturing the oil. This should be devised and required. Because an oil company's interests are not aligned with the public's interests, the oil company must be liable, but not in charge. Allowing an oil company to run the response to a spill makes it possible for it to try to hide the amount of oil and the numbers of wildlife killed, to suppress scientific data and hamper journalists. The federal government should nationalize major spills, avail itself of the best pooled talent in the oil industry, and send the offending company the people's bill. Once it's on our property, the offending oil company should not touch anything unless specifically directed to do so. As it is now, things are so insanely backward that at the end of June the Coast Guard made it a felony for boats to get within 70 feet of boom. We need to stop putting the murderer in charge of the crime scene. Larger lessons lurk. The mortgage bubble, banking collapse, taxpayer-funded bailouts and this blowout all stem from a three-decade assault on government effectiveness, the consequent deregulation Mardi Gras, and the unleashing of corporate greed and corporate ""personhood."" Corporate capture of government away from the public's interests is the basic poison. Campaign finance reform and publicly funded elections would be the antidote. Lastly and probably most important, to honor the scale of this catastrophe, we need to create a historic moment that begins to give us some energy options and creates a graceful phase-in of greater reliance on the clean, eternal energy that actually runs our planet. There are many reasons to do this. Blowouts and dead workers and the awful environmental destruction wrought by coal mining and oil are some. Helping weaken petro-dictators and gaining U.S. energy independence is major. Helping stabilize world climate and the acidifying seas, and securing agriculture, are yet others. Providing jobs, incentives for construction and investment opportunities are others still. The basic vision is to reduce oil subsidies, create a level playing field for clean renewable energies like wind, solar, tidal, geothermal, algae fuels, etc; construct a national smart grid capable of carrying power produced by any energy source whether dirty or renewable from where it's abundant to where it's needed. Electric cars would be the grid's storage battery. Other countries -- China and some in northern Europe -- are doing this. But I'd rather see American leadership regained. The nation that owns the future of energy will own the future. I want that nation of the future to be the United States of America.

433,"(CNN) -- A 25-year-old woman who was injured in last week's stampede at the Love Parade music festival in Duisburg, Germany, died Wednesday, bringing the death toll to 21, prosecutors there said. The deadly crush happened Saturday in an underpass between the main event site and an expansion area. Witnesses told CNN affiliate NTV that people pushed into the tunnel from both sides until it was dangerously overcrowded. The panic began when people began to lose consciousness as they were crushed against the walls and each other. The Duisburg public prosecutor's office said 511 were injured. Of these, 283 people had to be treated in hospitals, and all but 43 have been released. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for a thorough investigation into the incident and said that she was ""horrified and saddened"" by the tragedy. Carsten Lueb of NTV said some 1.4 million people showed up at the popular Love Parade festival, which featured dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours. Organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so to accommodate more people they opened an additional event site. The numbers are disputed by police, who say the area can hold between 250,000 and 350,000 and at no time was it filled to capacity. NTV reported that 1,400 police officers were on hand to monitor the event. Detlef von Schmeling of the Duisburg police said more than 4,000 police officers provided security. Witnesses told NTV that police were warned at least an hour before the incident that the underpass was becoming dangerously crowded. An additional entryway had been opened before the accident to relieve some of the pressure. Police are investigating how the back-up came to occur in the underpass.","Twenty-one people have died in the tragedy .

434,"(CNN) -- All passengers aboard a passenger train that fell into a river in southwest China's Sichuan ProvinceThursday got out alive, state-run CCTV reported Friday. The accident occurred in Guanghan at about 3:20 p.m. Thursday on the Shi-ting-jiang Bridge, part of the railway line that links Chengdu and Baoji, in northwestern Shaanxi Province. Floods caused the bridge piers to collapse, which forced the train from its track, local officials said. It was not immediately known how many passengers were inside the carriages, which a firefighter said were swept 200 meters downriver. Hundreds of people aboard five other carriages were taken to safety. The train was traveling from Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi, to Kunming, the capital of southwestern Yunnan Province.","NEW: All passengers got out alive .

""At that location and on that road, it could have happened to anybody,"" Tang said. ""For unknown reasons, Mr. Gibson steered his car to the right and struck the rock hillside,"" the police news release said. Gibson, who is in a bitter child custody dispute with his ex-girlfriend, is the target of celeb photographers. Gibson publicist Alan Nierob, asked if the paparazzi might have been a factor in the accident, said, ""Not that I'm aware of."" The CHP spokesman said the actor made it out of the crash with ""no injuries, not even a scratch."" He theorized Gibson must have been wearing his seat belt. ""He's OK,"" Nierob said. When Gibson was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence in Malibu four years ago, he became belligerent with Los Angeles sheriff's deputies. He was given three years probation after entering a no-contest plea to a charge of drunken driving. He later admitted making anti-Semitic remarks during his arrest and apologized, saying the comments were ""blurted out in a moment of insanity."" Gibson ""was extremely cooperative, he was a gentlemen"" after Sunday's wreck, Tang said. His damaged car was towed away and Gibson rode home with a friend, according to the police report.

436,"(CNN) -- NASCAR team owner Jack Roush, who was injured in a plane crash Tuesday, was transferred from a Wisconsin hospital to the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota, according to a statement released Thursday by one of his companies. ""Following surgery Tuesday night, related to the facial damage sustained in the accident, he remains in serious, but stable condition,"" said the statement from ROUSH Performance Products. ""He will continue to be treated at Mayo Clinic for his facial injuries. The ROUSH organization would like to thank the physicians and staff at Theda Clark Medical Center in Neenah, Wisconsin, for the care and treatment provided during his stay."" When the auto racing magnate crashed his plane at an Oshkosh, Wisconsin, airport Tuesday night, the aircraft ""cartwheeled"" an undetermined number of times and ended up facing in the opposite direction, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Peter Knudson said Wednesday. Knudson said upon landing, the Beechcraft Premier jet, registered to Roush Fenway Racing LLC, rolled ""hard to the right,"" then its right wing dropped ""way down"" and struck a grass strip, and the plane flipped over at least once. The jet ended up facing north, though it had flown in facing south, Knudson said. The NASCAR owner was piloting the plane, which took off from Detroit, Michigan, Knudson said. The NTSB is leading the investigation into the accident. Roush's company said Thursday it would ""like to thank everyone for the outpouring of support and well wishes"" and encouraged people wishing to make a charitable donation in the name of Jack Roush to contribute to Speedway Children's Charities on the organization's website. The Experimental Aircraft Association said in a statement Tuesday night that Roush's passenger in the plane was Brenda Strickland of Plymouth, Michigan. Video showed the two of them walking away from the plane, which appeared to be split toward its midsection. Strickland was brought to Oshkosh's Mercy Medical Center. She was treated, then released Wednesday, Mercy spokeswoman Maria Heim said Thursday. The Experimental Aircraft Association's annual air show, AirVenture 2010, had just ended for the day Tuesday at Wittman Regional Airport in Oshkosh when the crash happened at 6:15 p.m., association spokesman Dick Knapinski said. The accident shut down the airport until its regular 8 p.m. closing time, but the airport re-opened Wednesday morning, according to Knapinski. He said Roush comes every year and ""does presentations as an airplane enthusiast."" Knapinski said Roush owns one of ""probably fewer than 200 airworthy"" World War II-era P-51 Mustang fighter planes and was scheduled to give a presentation about his vintage prop plane Tuesday. Roush had also been slated to appear at the air show Wednesday, signing autographs and talking to NASCAR fans at the Ford tent. ""Roush Fenway Racing is NASCAR's largest team, operating eight motorsports teams -- four in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series with drivers Matt Kenseth, Greg Biffle, Carl Edwards and David Ragan, and four in the Nationwide Series with Edwards, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Colin Braun, Brian Ickler and Paul Menard,"" said a statement from Roush's racing team.","Auto racing magnate Jack Roush has been transferred to the Mayo Clinic .

437,"(CNN) -- A cholera outbreak has erupted this summer in Africa, killing more than 600 people in the neighboring countries of Nigeria and Cameroon. Nigeria's Health Ministry said more than 350 people have died since June and the infection threatens to spread to the entire country, the most populous in Africa. In neighboring Cameroon, nearly 300 people have been killed. ""There's a lot of people crossing over the border all the time,"" said Dr. Eric Mintz, the leader of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's global water sanitation and hygiene epidemiology team. ""So it's not surprising that the cholera is also crossing over the border."" Nigeria's outbreak had sickened more than 6,400 people and killed 352 people by Wednesday, the federal Ministry of Health reported. ""Although most of the outbreaks occurred in the northwest and northeast zones, epidemiological evidence indicates that the entire country is at risk,"" the ministry reported. Cholera occurs in much of the country under normal conditions, but the lack of clean drinking water and recent flooding following heavy rains are fueling the spread of disease, the ministry reported. Two-thirds of rural Nigerians lack access to safe drinking water, and fewer than 40 percent of the people in the affected states have access ""to toilet facilities of any description,"" the health ministry said. The intestinal infection causes diarrhea and vomiting that can cause severe dehydration without prompt attention, according to the World Health Organization. About 120,000 people die worldwide each year from cholera, and the disease can kill within hours if untreated, the World Health Organization says. Cholera is spread through water contaminated with human waste. ""What puts people at risk is a lack of safe drinking water,"" Mintz said. Boiling the water or treating it with chlorine or filtration or other ways to remove the contaminants can make it safe. Untreated, cholera can kill within hours, WHO said. Mintz said the Cameroon outbreak began in May and has exceeded 3,000 cases. Under ideal conditions, cholera's fatality rate ought to be less than 1 percent, he said. But Cameroon's conditions are not ideal. Many people live far from the medical aid that could help them rehydrate and replace the sodium and . potassium lost in their stools and vomit. ""That delay can be critical,"" Mintz said. ""If you don't get the fluids and the electrolytes replaced through hydration, you can go into shock and die as a result."" The country's northern region has been particularly hard hit. Three of 10 prisoners diagnosed with cholera at Maroua Central Prison in the far north were among the dead, the officials said. Mintz said the rugged and remote region has been affected repeatedly by cholera epidemics, most recently last year. About 70 percent of people living in the country's far north, bordering Nigeria and Chad and the Central African Republic, do not have access to potable water, according to a Ministry of Water and Energy official.","Flooding fuels an outbreak in Nigeria .

438,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Recovery crews ended the search for bodies in the hills north of Islamabad Thursday where a passenger plane crashed a day earlier killing all 152 aboard, a government officials told CNN. Ramzan Sajid, a local official in Islamabad, said 130 bodies were recovered from the crash site and delivered to several nearby hospitals. ""Not a single body was intact,"" Sajid said. He said hospital officials are trying to match body parts to account for the remains of 22 other people. Pakistan observed a day of mourning Thursday for victims of the accident, called the worst passenger plane crash ever on Pakistani soil. Officials do not know if weather played a factor in the crash Wednesday. Recovery crews have yet to find the plane's voice and data recorders. At Pakistan's Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital friends and family members of the passengers waited to identify their loved ones' remains. Amir Ali, another local government official in Islamabad, told CNN 66 bodies have been identified. Among them, 52 have been handed over to their families. The remaining bodies may have to identified with DNA tests and blood samples from relatives, Ali said. Crews will stay at the crash site to collect any remaining debris and search for the plane's flight data and voice recorders, said Sajid. Another day of torrential rains in Islamabad Thursday hampered those efforts. Investigators say they won't be able to explain why the plane crash until they review the plane's data recorders. On Thursday, Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani cancelled a cabinet meeting, and flags across the country flew at half-staff. The deadliest crash involving a Pakistani airline occurred in September 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed into a mountain in Nepal, killing all 167 people on board, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported. Pakistan is in the midst of the annual monsoon season, when rain sweeps across the subcontinent from June until September. The Airblue plane was headed to Islamabad from the sea port city of Karachi when it crashed in a hillside while trying to land. The Airbus A321 was carrying 146 passengers and six crew members, the airline said.

439,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Flooding has displaced an additional 1 million people in Pakistan's Sindh province in the past two days, according to new U.N. estimates released Friday. ""We have more people on the move, to whom we need to provide relief. An already colossal disaster is getting worse and requiring an even more colossal response,"" said Maurizio Giuliano, a spokesman for the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Giuliano said rains have forced the evacuation of an estimated 1 million people in southern Sindh in the past 48 hours or so. ""The magnitude of this crisis is reaching levels that are even beyond our initial fears, which were already leaning towards what we thought would be the worst. The number of those affected and those in need of assistance from us are bound to keep rising. The floods seem determined to outrun our response,"" he said. The U.N. also said Friday that it is increasingly concerned about flood-driven malnutrition among children. ""The flooding has surrounded millions of children with contaminated water,"" said Karen Allen, deputy representative of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Pakistan. ""Most have nothing else to drink. We fear the deadly synergy of waterborne diseases, including diarrhea, dehydration and malnutrition."" Acute malnutrition was high in much of Pakistan even before the floods. For instance, 27 percent of children under 5 in Baluchistan province were malnourished, as were 17 percent of children in Punjab, according to the U.N. A hospital in Sindh is overrun with people suffering from waterborne illness; two children share each bed and more are on the floor. A doctor at the hospital said there are ""not enough resources because of huge population ... coming to this hospital."" Remat Chacher, a farmer in Sindh, escaped the floodwaters with his wife and two children earlier this month. But then his 3-month-old daughter Benazir got sick. ""She started to get fever and couldn't keep anything down ... lots of belly pain,"" said Ulla, the infant's mom. A few days later, the same symptoms struck the Chachers' son, 2-year-old Wazira. Both children died on the way to the hospital, with Wazira weighing just 8 pounds and Benazir weighing 2 pounds. Floodwaters have started to recede across Pakistan, but in the Indus delta, the potential for more flooding remained high, especially given high tides in the Arabian Sea, where the Indus spills out. Already, more than 17 million Pakistanis -- from the Chinese border in the north to the mouth of the Indus in the south -- have been affected by the monsoon floods that began a month ago. To date, Pakistan's unfolding tragedy has claimed 1,600 lives, according to the National Disaster Management Authority. That number is likely to rise as more drowned bodies are discovered in receding waters. Many refugees have sought shelter at relief camps, where food and drinking water are now available. But every day, there are new camp arrivals -- people who were already poor, who now have nothing. Along the flooded Swat River in northeastern Pakistan, six local aid workers have spent two weeks braving the torrents on rafts they built from used tire tubes, bamboo and gaffers' tape after motorized boats failed to arrive. The workers are ferrying tents, blankets and other supplies to hundreds of thousands of people stranded across the river and cut off from normal supply routes. Last year, bombs and bullets from the army's offensive against the Taliban destroyed many homes and lives in the region. Residents had barely begun to recover when the rains came. ""We are fed up,"" said Shahravan, a 65-year old man who lost his house in the floods. ""You don't ask a dead man why he's in his grave. It's not his choice."" Fayas Muhammad, another local, said he lost his leg when his house was mistakenly bombed in last year's fighting. The same blast took his wife and son. ""We are very sad for all that Swat has been through,"" he said. The damage from Pakistan's worst humanitarian catastrophe is sure to hurtle the impoverished nation back in terms of development. This week, America's top aid official saw firsthand the dire needs in Pakistan. Dr. Rajiv Shah, administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development, said he was deeply moved by his visit to Sukkur and that aid agencies were ""scaling up their response efforts as quickly as they possibly can."" Shah announced the United States would be diverting another $50 million for flood relief from the Kerry-Lugar Act, which allocated $7.5 billion in nonmilitary assistance to Pakistan over five years.

440,"(CNN) -- A second U.S. sailor who went missing in Afghanistan last week is dead, a Pentagon official said Thursday. Petty Officer 3rd Class Jarod Newlove, 25, of Renton, Washington, was one of two sailors involved in a firefight on Friday in eastern Afghanistan. They were traveling in Logar province when they were attacked, the military said. Deen Mohammad Darwish, a Logar province official, said Newlove's body was found in the Baraki Barak district of the province early on Wednesday. Newlove's family was notified the same day, the Pentagon official said. The sailor died of wounds he sustained from the firefight when the two sailors were captured, Darwish said. Newlove had five gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Darwish said. The government asked the local elders of the province to form a committee and talk to the Taliban in order to retrieve the missing sailor. Because of the negotiations with the elders, the Taliban gave the body back without submitting any demands, Darwish said. Afghan and coalition forces first recovered the remains of Petty Officer 2nd Class Justin McNeley, 30, of Wheatridge, Colorado, on Sunday. Petty had been listed as duty status whereabouts unknown. On Monday, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said one American died in a firefight and the other was being held by the group. Mujahid said the two Americans were driving in a civilian vehicle in the village of Dasht, in Charkh district. The Taliban wanted to take both men alive, but the firefight broke out, killing one of the Americans, Mujahid said. The other was alive and being held in a safe location, he said at the time. Newlove's family released a statement through the Navy asking that the media release no details of the incident or information about the family. Darwish said he learned from locals that McNeley was killed. He said the body was found in the Patanak Mountains of Charkh district. He also said the vehicle the men were driving was located Sunday. There had been no immediate demands by the Taliban for the return of the Americans because the group was still deliberating what its demands would be, Mujahid said.

441,"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Eleven-year-old Hiroki Ando will likely die if he does not get a new heart. Hiroki in an ambulance on the way to catch his flight to New York, where he will wait for a heart. Hiroki suffers from cardiomyopathy, which inflames and impairs the heart. The same disease killed his sister five years ago. ""We have two children in our family who got a disease that happens one out of every 100,000 people. I am sorry for my children. We are having my daughter and Hiroki going through this harsh experience,"" said father Ryuki Ando. ""We were told by his doctor at the end of last year that the heart transplant operation was the only way for him to survive,"" Ando said. But the law in Japan prohibits anyone under the age of 15 from donating organs -- meaning Hiroki can't get a new heart in his home country. According to the web site for Japan Transplant Network, a non-governmental group that supports changing Japan's transplant law, ""this stipulation has greatly reduced the possibility of transplants to small children; heart transplants to small children have become impossible.""  Watch Hiroki's trip to the United States » . Lawmaker Taro Kono is spearheading efforts to change the law, which was enacted in 1997. Japan's parliament is now debating four proposed amendments-- including one that would scrap the age limit. But, beyond the age matter, the issue of organ transplantation in general, has been a difficult one for the country because of perceptions of brain death. Some refuse to accept it if their loved ones' hearts are still beating. ""For a long time, it's the heart that mattered in Japan. Some religions ask us not to declare being brain dead as death. But that is not the majority,"" Kono said. ""So it is simply that we have been doing things this way and a lot of people are very skeptical about it."" Kono, who gave a kidney to his father, said a total of 81 organ transplants have been conducted in Japan since the transplant law was enacted in 1997, whereas nearly thousands of transplants occur in the United States each year. ""A lot of people in Japan waiting for a transplant, waiting for a liver, a heart, other organs, most of them just die simply because they couldn't get any organs,"" he said. Kono said he believes the public supports changing the law to allow organ donation from children, noting that ""when the parents of the child are going on the street asking for donations, they can actually raise more than a million dollars."" Incredibly, that's just what Hiroki's family has done. They started a group called ""helping Hiroki"" and raised $1.7 million in donations. ""It was very tough to get the donations, but so many people from all over Japan donated the money,"" he said. ""It was not only the money, but so many letters and messages to energize us, sent to the group. We realized there are so many people supporting us, and they are the reason that we made it this far and will be able to continue after going to the U.S."" Hiroki is now at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, awaiting a new heart. His father says he knows that the transplant issue is a difficult one for families. ""The honest wish from the recipient's side is to have a donor show up as soon as possible,"" he said, pausing. ""I still do not know whether I can make a decision to give my child's heart to someone else if I am faced with such a situation. But unless the people face the issue and think about it seriously, I do not think the time will come soon to see more people volunteering to donate organs."" Ando said he hopes that one day he will be able to play baseball with his son, who is an avid sports fan. ""I would like to have a fun time again with Hiroki. I would like to make it home with everyone in good health,"" he said. ""That's the biggest hope I have now."" Ando's mother wrote in a blog on her Web site (http://www.hirokikun.jp/) that Hiroki was high on the waiting list for a heart transplant in New York. ""I believe Hiroki will be all right,"" she wrote.","Hiroki Ando, 11, suffers from cardiomyopathy, which inflames and impairs the heart .

442,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Dozens of schoolgirls and teachers were sickened Wednesday by poison gas in Afghanistan, medical and government officials said. The latest incident, this one at a high school, is the ninth such case involving the poisoning of schoolgirls, said Asif Nang, spokesman for the nation's education ministry. Dr. Kabir Amiri said 59 students and 14 teachers were brought to the hospital, and were faring better. ""We don't have good equipment to verify the kind of gas that they were poisoned with, but we have taken their blood tests to send to Turkmenistan for verifying the type of gas"" that was used, Amiri said. Many Afghan girls were not allowed to attend school during the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001. Girls' schools began reopening after the Islamist regime was toppled. The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, estimates that 2 million Afghan girls attend school these days. But female educational facilities, students and teachers have come under vicious attack as the insurgency has strengthened and spread from Taliban strongholds in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand. A report compiled last year by the humanitarian agency CARE documented 670 education-related attacks in 2008, including murder and arson. Much of the violence in what CARE called an ""alarming trend"" occurred at girls' schools. CNN's Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.","Under Taliban rule, girls were banned from schools .

443,"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Forecast to gain ""major"" Category 3 status, outer rainbands association with a strengthening Hurricane Earl were affecting the islands of Antigua and Barbuda on Sunday, with conditions forecast to deteriorate, the National Hurricane Center said. Earl became a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday. As of 8 p.m. ET, its center was about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Barbuda and about 185 miles (300 kilometers) east of St. Martin. Its maximum sustained winds had increased slightly to 85 mph (140 kph) and higher gusts, and the storm was heading west-northwest at near 14 mph (22 kph). The center of Earl is forecast to pass near or over the northern Leeward Islands Sunday night and Monday, the center said. A hurricane warning was in effect for Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, St. Martin, St. Barthelemy, Saba and St. Eustatius. As of 5 p.m., the government of Antigua and Barbuda also had added the British Virgin Islands to the warning, forecasters said. A hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning was in effect for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, including the islands of Culebra and Vieques. Tropical storm-force conditions were forecast in the warning area Sunday afternoon and evening, with hurricane conditions expected early Monday, forecasters said. Tropical storm conditions were expected to spread across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Monday, with hurricane conditions possible on Monday night. ""Strengthening is expected during the next 48 hours, and Earl is forecast to become a major hurricane by Tuesday,"" forecasters said. Earl was forecast to turn west-northwest and slow down over the next day. Tracking maps show it moving northward away from the Caribbean and possibly affecting the U.S. East Coast by Friday. Easterners should pay attention to Earl, as it could affect areas anywhere from the Carolinas to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, over Labor Day weekend, said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. It is too soon to tell whether the storm could make landfall, she said. However, outer bands of the storm are likely to hit North Carolina beginning Thursday, kicking up large swells and possibly generating rip currents through Labor Day weekend, Jeras said. Earl is expected to dump between 3 and 5 inches of rain over the northern Leeward Islands, with isolated amounts of 8 inches possible in some areas. Puerto Rico is expected to receive between 4 and 6 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of 12 inches possible over higher elevations. In addition, Earl is expected to produce a 2-to-4-foot storm surge within the hurricane warning area, and 1-to-3-foot storm surge in coastal areas, accompanied by high surf. Meanwhile, Hurricane Danielle remained away from land, and was gradually weakening as it moved northeastward, the hurricane center said. The center of the storm was about 605 miles (975 kilometers) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Once a Category 4 storm, Danielle had weakened Sunday to a Category 1 hurricane with winds of near 80 mph (130 kph). It was expected to continue to weaken, and was moving north-northeast at near 29 mph (46 kph). Large waves and dangerous surf conditions should diminish near Bermuda on Sunday, the hurricane center said, and ""swells from Danielle are expected to gradually subside during the next day or two along portions of the United States East Coast."" A number of people were rescued along the East Coast because of those swells and riptide currents. Nearly 250 were rescued Saturday in the waters off Ocean City, Maryland, authorities said. In addition, an area eastward from Earl could develop into a tropical depression and then potentially into Tropical Storm Fiona, Jeras said.","Too soon to tell whether Earl could dampen U.S. Labor Day .

444,"(CNN) -- Watching the Toyota recall crisis unfold over the past few months has been like watching a wildfire on a windy day. Just when it would appear that the flames might be contained, another powerful gust sweeps through, stirring them up and blowing them still higher. True, Toyota has acted as its own arsonist at times. If it had attacked the floor-mat entrapment problem as aggressively in 2007 as it is doing now, then perhaps the current crisis could have been avoided. And if the company had been acting as a better switchboard operator between Europe and North America, it could have more quickly connected the sticking accelerator problems in some European cars with the fact that the same pedal assembly was used in eight U.S. models. And it might possibly have avoided the recent stop-sale on those models. But some of the gusts have been whipped up by the news media. The software glitch in the antilock braking system of the 2010 Toyota Prius and Lexus HS 250h, which causes a momentary loss of braking capability, is serious enough that it should be fixed. But on an overall scale of recalled problems, it's relatively minor. Yet, it continues to grab headlines in this Toyota-sensitized environment. Vehicles are recalled all the time by just about every automaker. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued 1,399 safety-related recalls affecting more than 38 million vehicles from 2007 to 2009. And while Toyota's inferno has been grabbing the nation's attention, new recalls have been springing up. Chrysler, GM, Honda and Mazda have all issued recalls in recent weeks, for problems ranging from faulty power steering to defective air bags. And Hyundai issued its own stop-sale on the 2011 Sonata because of a faulty front-door latch. Yes, the idea of a runaway vehicle is a frightful thought to drivers. And we encourage the government to continue to investigate complaints of unintended acceleration. But consumers shouldn't lose sight of two important points. Such incidents are rare; the approximately 2,000 consumer complaints received by the NHTSA that were related to unintended acceleration in Toyotas over the past 10 years works out to about one in every 10,000 Toyotas sold over that period. Also, these complaints aren't confined to Toyota. In an analysis of 5,916 total complaints filed to the NHTSA database for 2008 models (as of August 28, 2009, before the problem hit the national spotlight), we found 166 related to unintended acceleration. While ones citing Toyota-built vehicles made up the highest percentage -- 41 percent -- there were also complaints related to 20 other brands. Ford vehicles drew the second-highest number at 28 percent. Still, while there has been unusually strong reaction to Toyota's problems, such flare-ups can lead to positive changes. Following the Firestone tires/Ford Explorer recalls in 2000, the government enacted the TREAD (Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation) Act.  Among other things, it mandated tire-pressure monitoring systems in passenger cars and created the Early Warning Reporting database, which requires manufacturers to report problem data to the NHTSA. We're hoping that the energy surrounding this crisis can be harnessed to improve our auto-safety system so that such rare-but-deadly problems can be caught earlier or prevented altogether. To that end, Consumer Reports is recommending that the government take the following actions: . -- Improve public access to safety information by making their complaint databases more uniform, user-friendly and easier to search. This would help investigators spot a problem trend more easily and perhaps address it before it becomes a crisis. -- Mandate that cars be required to stop in a reasonable distance, even with the throttle fully open. One solution to this is ""smart throttle"" technology, which disengages the throttle if the brake pedal is depressed. It's being used now by some automakers and Toyota says such a system will be installed in all of its models by the end of this year. -- Improve the recall compliance process. According to NHTSA, the average consumer response rate to vehicle recalls is only about 74 percent, meaning that a quarter of all affected vehicles never get the fix. This puts used-car buyers at unnecessary risk. -- Give regulators more funding. In 2007, auto crashes made up 99 percent of all transportation-related deaths and injuries. Yet, NHTSA's budget is just over 1 percent of the overall budget of its parent, the Department of Transportation. That's not enough for the reality of auto safety today. Despite the tragedies, the Toyota crisis can yet be a catalyst for positive change that can benefit consumers.

445,"(CNN) -- A bird struck the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines plane but the aircraft managed to land safely, officials said early Tuesday morning. The bird hit the plane above the windshield shortly after it took off Monday evening from Los Angeles International Airport en route to Vancouver, British Columbia, said Mike Fergus of the Federal Aviation Administration. The plane was 1.5 miles off the runway, Fergus said. iReport: Share images and information with CNN . The plane, Flight 707 with 159 passengers, returned safely to the airport for an inspection, said airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan. According to data released by the FAA, incidences of birds hitting planes have gone up in recent years. Last year officials said a migrating flock of Canada geese caused US Airways Flight 1549 to ditch in New York's Hudson River. Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and First Officer Jeffrey Skiles safely guided that plane to an emergency landing. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.","The plane is struck above the windshield .

446,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Five years after Hurricane Katrina struck, Conrad Wyre III is disappointed and disillusioned with the lack of progress made in New Orleans. ""Nothing's really changed,"" said the 35-year-old New Orleans native. He says some spots are still ""in shambles"" in 2010, and that many residents still feeling helpless and without support, like they're ""floating in the wind."" Wyre, known as ""Sam"" by his close friends and family, fled to Katy, Texas, with his then-pregnant wife shortly before the storm hit. But, he wasn't able to ride out the storm in peace for long. After Katrina hit, he received a frantic, barely audible phone call from his mother. She and Wyre's father had stayed put despite warnings. The floodwaters were rising and they were in dire need of help, and fast. Attempts to get assistance for his parents were futile. The Navy, the Coast Guard and the New Orleans Police Department were among the officials who told Wyre they couldn't reach the area where his mother and father were trapped. Shocked and upset with the those responses, Wyre knows there was no question about his next move. He immediately went back to save his parents from the flooding caused by the failed levees. ""People were down here suffering,"" Wyre said. ""Somebody dropped the ball. ... since the storm, I have lost faith in all levels of government."" The insurance companies haven't been helpful, either, Wyre said. His deductible is $7,500, which he wouldn't be able to afford should another such weather-based tragedy occur. Wyre made the eight-hour trek back to the ravaged city. About a mile from his parents' house, tents were set up and people had gathered there. Wyre paid a man with a boat $50 to take him to his parents' neighborhood, where he blew an air horn and looked for survivors. Wyre -- who didn't know how to swim -- found his parents, who were then taken to safety along with their neighbors. Wyre's parents were among the few people in their neighborhood who rebuilt their house, despite the damage done by Katrina. However, in a cruel twist of fate, a 2007 tornado destroyed their home again. Not wanting to fall victim to a weather disaster for a third time, they moved to a different neighborhood, but still close, and certainly within the state of Louisiana. Seeing his beloved city in ruins post-Katrina was devastating for Wyre. Eighty percent of the city was underwater. Streets once exploding with life -- loud music and laughing -- were drowned. There were many bleak moments. There were times when it seemed there was no hope. He says the crime, carjackings and political corruption the area experienced afterward hindered attempts for a much-needed renaissance. Some spots, such as Jefferson Parish, rebounded quickly, thanks in large part to the tourism sector. New Orleans has 300 more restaurants than it did before Katrina hit. Other areas have yet to make even a partial recovery, especially the Lower 9th Ward. Wyre says that was one place that lacked basic necessities, like grocery stores that operated for an extended period of time. In the days following Katrina, people stood in line for hours to get into the nearest Wal-Mart, where the shelves were quickly emptied. Animals were left to die in abandoned houses. For many, a deep depression sunk in. For some, it has yet to fade. ""There was nothing to come back to --nowhere to go -- it was horrible,"" says Wyre, who made a self-described ""emotional"" return visit to the  neighborhood of Hollygrove, where he grew up, and where he documented the devastation with before-and-after pictures for CNN.com's ""Then and Now"" project. In some instances, the changes seen in these pictures over a five-year span are minimal. Seeing areas that haven't been fixed since 2005 is tough for Wyre to accept. iReport: Wyre revisits Hollygrove . Many homes are still abandoned and boarded up. Old water marks, some reaching halfway up buildings, are still visible, as are spray-painted marks that indicated bodies, odor or pets inside. Overgrown yards and the obvious blight make it tough to forget all the damage. ""Everybody was poor after the storm,"" Wyre said. He says the still-rough conditions are why many evacuees have never returned to their neighborhoods. Many moved out of state to places like Atlanta, Georgia; Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas. It's tough for Wyre to walk down the familiar, once-vital streets now deserted. ""There's whole blocks with no cars, no one out and about ... nothing. It's boarded up, that's the aftermath of Katrina. Just have to deal with it."" But almost immediately after Katrina, Wyre and his family were itching to get back to the New Orleans they love. They weren't thrilled with their temporary time in Texas, saying there was a lack of action and excitement in the air. There were none of the parades, explosive brass band shows or nights spent drinking and laughing with friends regaling stories after a full day at work. It didn't take long for the Wyre family to pack up their belongings and get back to the city streets they knew and loved. Despite the past, and the lack of improvements in some sections of New Orleans, Wyre is still thinking optimistically, and keeping his fingers crossed. He's hoping brighter days are in the city's future, and is more than ready for the day when people in New Orleans are no longer treading water, but are able to swim deeply in Big Easy's legendary greatness. ""I love the city, the culture. ... That's all I know. I can't survive anywhere else.""","Photographer Conrad Wyre III left New Orleans shortly before Katrina struck .

447,"(CNN) -- A body found in southeast Memphis, Tennessee, on Wednesday has been identified as that of former professional basketball player Lorenzen Wright, Memphis police said. The cause of death has been ruled as ""homicide by gunshot wound,"" police said Thursday in a news release, adding that the Shelby County medical examiner used dental records to confirm Wright's identity. ""Investigators continue to work around the clock to bring justice to Mr. Wright and his family,"" the police department said in a statement. Before that confirmation, Wright's family had already said that they were mourning his loss. Wright's cousin, Camella Logan, had released a statement to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper saying, ""We appreciate your thoughts, prayers and condolences as they are comforting at this very difficult time."" Wright, who has a home in Atlanta, was reported missing on July 22. He had been visiting with his former wife and their children in Collierville, near Memphis, investigators said. Wright was last seen at his former wife's home shortly before midnight on July 18, and a 911 call was placed from his phone in the early hours of July 19, police said. His body was found on Wednesday by Shelby County Emergency Services Search and Rescue, police said. Dewayne Benton, a Christian radio personality in Memphis, said he left work early to investigate reports his station received about the body. Benton described the crowded crime scene as somber. ""Lorenzen Wright had a lot of financial problems ... but this was just horrible,"" said Benton. ""He was one of the favorite sons of Memphis,"" he added. The 6-foot-11-inch Wright was a high school basketball star in Memphis, and he played professionally for the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies from 2001 through 2006. ""We are deeply saddened by the tragic death of Lorenzen Wright,"" the team's majority owner, Michael Heisley, said in a statement on the Grizzlies' website. ""We lost a member of the Grizzlies family."" During his 13-year professional basketball career Wright also played with the Los Angeles Clippers, Sacramento Kings and most recently with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Wright did two tours with the Atlanta Hawks as well, from 1999 to 2001 and from 2006 to 2008. Former Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens said, ""Lorenzen was a real congenial young man who played with a lot of enthusiasm. This is certainly a huge loss for his family and friends."" ""Our thoughts and prayers are with [his family] during this difficult time,"" said Hawks General Manager Rick Sund in a press statement released Thursday by the NBA team.","NEW: Police say the medical examiner used dental records to identify Lorenzen Wright's body .

448,"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Wildfires in Russia, among the worst ever there, have killed 25 people, destroyed more than 1,000 homes, and prompted the prime minister to call on local officials to resign, response officials and Russian news agencies reported Friday. The fires have been raging in five regions as Russia endures dry weather and one of the hottest months on record. Thursday saw Moscow reach 102 Fahrenheit (39 Celsius), the highest temperature since records began in 1879. The fires are the worst ever to hit the European part of Russia, the region west of the Ural Mountains, the RIA-Novosti news agency said. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said there have been 21,690 fires so far this summer, 10 percent more than last year, the news agency reported. President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the Defense Ministry on Friday to use the military to help tackle the fires, the president's spokeswoman, Natalya Timakova, told the Interfax news agency. The government has already dispatched additional firefighting units, along with 16 aircraft and helicopters, to fight the fires, RIA-Novosti said. Putin and Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu flew Friday to one of the affected regions, Nizhny Novgorod, where Putin called on local officials to step down. ""I recommend the resignation of the heads of regions (devastated by fire) who have, to a significant degree, lost the trust of citizens,"" Putin said, according to RIA-Novosti. Many residents who lost their homes in Nizhny Novgorod had complained to Putin that local authorities' actions were ""chaotic and uncoordinated,"" RIA-Novosti reported. The fires have so far killed 25 people, including two firefighters, according to an official at the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry. Across the 14 fire-striken regions of central Russia, 1,257 homes have burned, and some 2,000 people have been left without housing. Sixty homes were burned in the region of Moscow. ""I don't know what to do,"" one Voronezh woman told state TV. ""Haven't got any bed linen, cups, spoons, forks left. We're left with nothing. Everything was burned down. We couldn't salvage anything."" Putin said the families of those who died will receive 1 million rubles ($33,000) each in compensation, and the government will pay around 3 million rubles ($100,000) for the reconstruction of each destroyed house, RIA-Novosti said. Putin also said the government will compensate people for the loss of property, the news agency said. Temperatures across much of western and central Russia have topped 95 Fahrenheit (35 Celsius) during the past five weeks, RIA-Novosti said. Thursday's temperature in Moscow broke the previous record high of 99.5 Fahrenheit (37.5 Celsius), set just three days earlier. The month of July is expected to break the record for the hottest month ever recorded in Moscow. High temperatures in Moscow dropped to between 82 and 86 Fahrenheit (28 to 30 Celsius) Friday because of a breeze, but weekend temperatures were forecast to rise again. The threat of more fires breaking out will remain high in the Central and Volga Federal Districts next week, given the abnormal heart wave and the lack of rain, the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia has reported on its web site. The hot, dry weather is believed to have dried out large parts of land, making it easier for flames to spread. Central Russia also has large areas of peat bogs that often catch on fire in dry and hot weather. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Two firefighters are among the dead .

450,"(CNN) -- A man suspected in the shooting deaths of five people at a Lake Havasu City, Arizona, residence on Saturday night was found dead early Sunday of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police. The killings began just before midnight Saturday when police say 26-year-old Brian Diez entered the residence, shot six people and abducted two children from the home, according to a press release from the Lake Havasu City Police Department. Four of the victims were pronounced dead. Two others were transported to local hospitals, where one of them died of his injuries. According to an Amber Alert issued Sunday for the missing children, Diez, their father, was locked in a custody battle with their mother, identified by police as 23-year-old Deborah Langstaff. Langstaff was among the five people killed. A little more than three hours after the shootings, Lake Havasu police investigators discovered that Diez's vehicle was parked at a home in Rancho Cucamonga, California, more than 250 miles away from the site of the killings. At about the same time, local sheriff's deputies were dispatched to the same residence, responding to a report of a suicide. ""Deputies arrived and found Diez deceased of an apparent self-inflicted gun shot wound,"" police said in a statement. The two children, identified by police as 4-year-old Kaia Diez and 13-month-old Cole Diez, were found safe at the California home with family members. Police said the five people killed in Arizona were: Langstaff, Primo Verdone, 24, Russell Nyland, 42, Ashley Nyland, 20, and Brock Kelson, 20. Deborah Nyland, 44, was transported to Sunrise Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Her condition was unknown Sunday night. The relationship between the victims was not immediately clear.","Police say Brian Diez, 26, shot six people, killing five of them .

451,"(CNN) -- Tragedy struck at a Pennsylvania circus Friday after a startled elephant stomped its trainer to death, police said. People at the Irem Shrine in Wilkes-Barre, which has been hosting the James Hamid Circus all week, rushed to help but not before the trainer sustained life-threatening injuries, said police Lt. Steven Oshefski. It was unclear what spooked the elephant, but the pachyderm was calmed by those on the scene. The victim is not being identified until next-of-kin have been notified, Oshefski said. The incident was classified as a workplace accident and the investigation has been turned over to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. A balloon vendor at the circus told CNN affiliate WBRE that the death was shocking. ""In the 30 years I've been doing my vending, I've never heard an animal killing their trainer and all,"" said Ed Conrad. ""So something must have happened."" Oshefski said the elephant came into contact with electrical wires, but it was unclear what exactly startled the animal. Animal rights activists decried the use of animals in circuses. ""It should come as no surprise that elephants and other animals sometimes snap and attack circus employees and members of the public,"" said Robbyn Brooks of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). ""PETA has obtained shocking photos and video of circus trainers as they beat elephants and subject them to violent training methods using barbaric devices such as bullhooks,"" Brooks said. Circus members observed a moment of silence for the elephant handler who died, WBRE reported. The circus, however, made a decision almost immediately after the death that the performance would go on.","Startled elephant stomps trainer at circus, killing him, authorities say .

452,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The death toll climbed to 50 on Friday after a pair of suicide bombers detonated their explosive vests at one of Pakistan's holiest shrines, police said. More than 200 people were injured in the blasts outside the Data Darbar, a famous Sufi shrine complex. Lahore Commissioner Khusro Pervez said the remains of the bombers -- a man in his 20s and another in his late teens -- have been recovered. One of the bombs detonated in the shrine's courtyard; the other in the shrine's lower lever, according to Chaudhry Shafiq Ahmed, Lahore's senior police superintendent. The first explosion, which occurred at 10:48 p.m. Thursday, was followed five minutes later by a second blast, Geo TV reported. The CNN affiliate aired surveillance footage showing the first attacker entering through a gate holding a bag. As he passed through a metal detector, alarms went off and the man ran toward an area used for ablutions and blew himself up. Geo TV showed a second attacker entering amid the confusion a few minutes later and running upstairs carrying a bag. Then the video showed the explosion. Geo TV reported that the heads of two bombers were recovered and identified. The bombers arrived at the shrine on foot wearing 10 kilogram (22 pound) jackets that had been packed with ball bearings, it said. A witness told Geo TV that one of the bombers was wearing the traditional loose-fitting salwar kameez, a turban and slippers. ""This sickening poison of extremism will be driven out of our nation and we will not be cowed,"" said Farahnaz Ispahani, a spokeswoman for President Asif Ali Zardari, in a text message to CNN. ""Peaceful worshippers have once again been targeted by those who want to destroy the fabric of this great country. We will not forgive or forget and we will get justice for all Pakistanis murdered in cold blood -- be they Muslim, Christian, Ahmadi or of any other faith."" Pakistan's Punjab province, of which Lahore is the capital, has been the scene of carnage in recent weeks, including a bloody attack on a hospital and another targeting Ahmadis. On Friday, angry Pakistanis, some wielding guns for revenge, took to the streets of Lahore in protest. Growing weary of bloodshed in their homeland, many are troubled by its spread from the Afghan border areas to the heartland. They are also concerned that Muslims are attacking Islamic holy sites. Sunni and Shiites do not consider the Ahmadis as a part of Islam because they do not regard Mohammed as the last prophet sent by God. As such, they have been targeted by Islamic extremists. Friday's attack was at a revered Sufi shrine. Sufism is an ancient, mystical form of Islam that is generally more tolerant. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed alarm over the attacks and called on both the government and Muslim clerics to stand up to extremism. ""It is a matter of grave concern that despite repeated official claims of breaking the back of terrorists, they retain the ability to launch vicious terrorist attacks across the country almost at will,"" the commission said in a statement Friday. ""The assault demonstrates the potency of militant groups that the government incessantly repeats operate from sanctuaries in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan,"" the statement said. ""Equally frustrating have been clerics' stock statement that no Muslim can commit such atrocities. Instead of living in denial, the clerics need to reflect on the reasons for religious extremism in Pakistan and the possible consequences and their own contribution to the promotion of intolerance and the cult of violence.""

453,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- More favorable weather conditions Saturday helped firefighters in their bid to contain the roaring Crown Fire, one of several in southern California. Firefighters had the fire 82 percent contained Saturday evening, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. Authorities said that they had lifted evacuation orders and most residents had returned home, while hundreds of firefighters and more than a dozen aircraft worked to extinguish the Crown Fire. ""If we can get aggressive with the air drops we'll be in good shape. And we're already doing pretty good,"" Don Kunitomi of the Los Angeles County Fire Department told CNN. The blaze has ignited 14,000 acres in the area, fire officials said. Two other fires have blackened more than 17,000 acres. Fire officials said the Crown Fire represents the biggest challenge. On Friday, about 1,370 firefighters and 250 fire engines were at the scene of the blaze, which was burning in a sparsely populated, rural area. Authorities were working to ensure the Crown Fire did not destroy power lines that provide electricity throughout the region. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has asked residents near the fire to limit their power usage, though no fire-related outages have been reported. The weather did not cooperate Friday, which turned out to be one of the hottest days this week, with humidity in the low teens. ""That's creating a little bit of a challenge, and obviously causing a bit more fire spread,"" said Matt Levesque of the L.A. County Fire Department. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said the situation in southern California changed drastically as the weather shifted. ""We were very fortunate not to have fires for some time, because the air was cool and we didn't have the experience of dry weather and all of these winds and so on, but all of a sudden the fire season kicked in,"" he said Friday. ""But we are ready,"" the governor added. ""There's great coordination going on, and we have resources distributed all over the state."" The cause of the Crown Fire is under investigation. Two more wildfires engulfed the area this week: the Bull Fire, southeast of the town of Tehachapi, and the West Fire, north of Tehachapi in the Sequoia National Forest. The Bull Fire has ignited 16,460 acres and was 81 percent contained, officials said Saturday morning. It has destroyed eight homes, but no evacuations have been ordered. Meanwhile, the West Fire has destroyed 30 structures, mostly homes. Authorities have warned residents to keep their cars and house windows closed to prevent smoke inhalation. Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency for Kern County, located approximately 130 miles north of Los Angeles.","NEW: So-called Crown Fire is 82 percent contained .

454,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Some 14 million people have been affected by the torrential rains and flooding that have left more than 1,000 dead in Pakistan, a spokesman for the national disaster authority told CNN Tuesday. While 1,245 people have been confirmed killed, officials believe the number of dead may reach 1,500, said spokesman Ahmed Kamal. He said 1,334 people have been injured and 337,282 people have been rescued. More than 302,000 houses have been damaged, Kamal said, but that number might more than double by the time the flooding subsides. Most of the displaced have sought shelter in public buildings, including schools, said a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. They include thousands of Afghan refugees ""who have suddenly lost their homes for the second time."" Pakistan's Meteorological Department said more heavy rains were in store in the next few days, threatening to deepen the worst natural disaster the nation has experienced in recent history. The monsoon season is only halfway over. The flooding, which started in the northwest, threatened places as far south as the port city of Karachi. Nineteen people died across the country between Sunday and Monday nights, Kamal said. The weather in the northwest province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa did improve slightly Tuesday, which allowed 23 helicopters to take off for relief and rescue operations, according to a military spokesperson who did not want to be identified. Kamal said 76 helicopters and 621 boats were participating in rescue efforts. Of those affected by the flooding, 6 million to 7 million are in immediate need of food and other items, said Maurizio Giuliano, information officer for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. ""While not all may be in need of immediate humanitarian assistance, and the severity of their needs has not yet been fully assessed, this is a higher figure than those who were affected by the 2005 South Asia tsunami (3 million), the 2005 South Asia earthquake (3 million), or the 2010 Haiti earthquake (3 million),"" he said Monday in a statement. Though the number of fatalities was not comparable with either the tsunami or the earthquake, both of which had death tolls that exceeded 200,000, Pakistan's flooding ""is a major disaster of enormous magnitude,"" said John Holmes, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and emergency relief coordinator. Many Pakistanis are not happy with the government's response to the floods, saying it has been slow and ineffective. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari returned home Monday from an overseas trip, facing growing criticism of his actions following the massive flooding. He had been in England for talks with British Prime Minister David Cameron during the worst of the crisis. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said a true assessment of the loss of life and infrastructure can be determined only after the water recedes. He appealed to the international community and to Pakistanis living abroad to help. Aid agencies scrambled to help those in need. ""The assistance that we have so far provided has alleviated suffering, but relief operations need to be massively scaled up,"" said Martin Mogwanja, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Pakistan. U.S. emergency relief teams continued to arrive in Peshawar to help, the U.S. State Department said. The U.S. Agency for International Development has committed $55 million in aid to international organizations and nongovernmental organizations, it said. The United States has provided more than 435,000 meals. This assistance is in addition to U.S. military efforts, which include rescue airlifts, food supplies and other deliveries provided by the Pentagon. Of the total, $20 million will be used to expand humanitarian operations farther south as the flood zone expands, Mark Ward, acting director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, told reporters Tuesday. CNN's Reza Sayah and Samson Desta and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","NEW: The displaced in Pakistan include thousands of Afghan refugees .

455,"Port-au-Prince, Haiti -- Horror has given way to acceptance; it can be seen on people's faces. But desperation surfaces everywhere: . In the rubble still strewn about the streets, in the steadily rising piles of garbage, in the 1,300 makeshift camps that still house so many people. Four months on, the tragedy of the massive January 12 earthquake is fresh. Relief operations thwarted widespread hunger here and so far, there have been no reports of killer disease outbreaks. But Port-au-Prince is very much running in emergency mode. Still. No humanitarian worker will argue with that sad fact. Despite the efforts and good intentions of a host of foreigners and a government that got a wake-up call, progress has been timidly slow. The future has a different meaning now for Haitians such as Edline Pierre, who worries not about where to enroll her three daughters in school but how to get them up off the floor fast enough when the rains start falling. Haiti earthquake special . She poured cement around her shack in the city's central Champs de Mars plaza. But that doesn't keep the water out or her girls safe at night. The future means getting through the night and when the sun comes back out, scrounging together a meal. On the streets, a bright spot: the sight of schoolchildren in uniforms. But only 700 of the 5,000 or so schools around the Haitian capital have opened. Some were destroyed; others are occupied by the displaced. Another welcomed sight: Hundreds of street vendors, many of whom are women, sit under a rainbow of umbrellas to sell mangoes, plantains and coconuts. Or they display a collision of goods in one basket -- shoe polish, spaghetti, shampoo, cigarettes and molasses. These are snippets of life as it was once, before that fatal day. Give us work -- not handouts . In the aftermath of what most Haitians refer to as ""the catastrophe,"" people asked for food. They patiently lined up for hours to receive a sack of rice, a quart of oil. The lines are gone, along with the massive aid drops. International agencies are wary that too much help could stymie the local economy. Now the two million Haitians living in squalid makeshift camps -- and countless others living in the homes of generous family and friends -- need jobs. They don't want handouts; they just want money so they can feed themselves. ""We are willing to work -- work hard -- for money, but we need jobs,"" said Joseph Cangas, a coordinator at a new camp in Corail. Some earn a few dollars here and there through work-for-cash programs. They clear debris off the streets or clean latrines in the camps. These are hardly high-quality jobs, but being employed anywhere will earn you envy. More than 100,000 Haitians found work this way. But that's only a sliver of the population. Almost four million people live in Port-au-Prince, a city designed for 250,000. Haitians lived in congested neighborhoods and shanties before the quake. Imagine those conditions compounded -- a family of six eating, sitting and sleeping in a space that's hardly bigger than the sofa in your den. When home is a place of last resort . To shield people from the potential danger of the rainy season, aid agencies have started building transitional homes and have relocated thousands to new camps on the city's perimeter. Almost 5,000 went to Corail, a stark place that evokes images of a military base in the Iraqi desert. Void of trees, the tropical sun beats down hard, and soaring temperatures make furnaces of the tents. It's not a place residents say they would choose. But this is where the government had access to land, so this is where people were brought to ride out the rains. Here, at least, they are not at risk of being washed away by torrents of water or in mudslides down steep, denuded hills. Corail has its own problems. It's far from the city, and it can cost a camp resident an astronomical $1.25 to take tap-taps, the colorful shared taxis, to central Port-au-Prince. No one at Corail could afford that journey. But they said they had to figure out a way to go where the jobs were. ""We help each other. We share food,"" said Cangas, the camp coordinator. ""But the situation is getting more tense. People have nothing so they resort to stealing sometimes."" He complained about the lack of services and schools at Corail. But aid agencies don't want people to get too comfortable here. Eventually, people have to try and regain their livelihoods in the neighborhoods where they were established. ""You want people to go home,"" said Mark Turner, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration. ""The last resort is a place like Corail."" Turner said camp managers have been asking Haiti's homeless this question: What will it take for you to move out of a camp? The answers are varied, and the problems aren't easily resolved. Not even the safe places feel safe . All over the city, buildings are being marked green, yellow and red. Some already say: ""To demolish."" But even after an engineer has marked a home green for ""safe,"" people are reluctant to return. The United Nations estimates only 9 percent of those with green houses have gone back. What if there is another earthquake? Gerald-Emile Brun, an architect working with the government on relocation, said incentives for people to go home -- $50 and a few provisions -- are being created. But so far, nothing has been doled out. For many, Brun recognized, it's impossible to go back to the spot where their house once stood because there is no place to dispose of the rubble. In this city of renters, landlords are refusing to accept people who cannot pay the back rent for the four months they have been gone. Many of the displaced can no longer even afford the monthly amount they were paying before. And as time marches on, many landowners want to evict displaced people so the buildings can be used as intended. What if your child could not go to school because the classrooms were occupied by the homeless? What if you were homeless and had no place to shelter your children except at the neighborhood school? It's a tough call, especially for humanitarian workers who don't believe in forced evictions. But at the same time, Turner said, ""we recognize the landowners have legitimate concerns."" These are municipal issues that will have to be dealt with by the local government, Turner said. But it won't be easy. Ask Jacques Pablito Chardavoire, who helps manage a camp in front of the city's main cathedral. Chardavoire's response was simple but to the point: . Why would you leave an encampment that offers you a toilet, a shower, emergency food rations and, yes, even an outdoor movie screen when you have no place to go and no money in your pockets? He said almost 2,000 people were resettled in February from Champs de Mars to the cathedral. But within days, that many more people from elsewhere had flocked to Champ de Mars. ""Every time we move people, more come because they need services,"" he said. Much is shattered, but not hope . Haitians, who have lived through political turmoil, extreme violence and grinding poverty, will tell you the earthquake was the worst experience of their lives. Whether a new city can rise from the rubble of Port-au-Prince remains in question, though Haitians are hopeful something good must come out of an event this tragic. They have to be. They have nothing left but hope. And faith. That's why if you peek down lanes on a steamy afternoon, you'll see a gathering of people under a tent, their arms stretched skyward, their eyes closed. And you'll hear the Lord's Prayer. You'll hear it, too, every Sunday morning, before the sun gets hot, at Notre Dame, the main cathedral in Port-au-Prince. The building is shattered, but not the congregation's faith. They still come to the place where, every week, they are re-energized by their belief in Christ. Several Haitians said they feared the world's goodwill would quickly fade now that the throngs of media have left and the spotlight has turned elsewhere. Edna Dunrod was one of them. She worried she was forgotten, lying on a smelly mattress under three tattered bed sheets that serve as a roof in the Champs de Mars tent city. Last month, she gave birth to Marvins, asleep in a plastic tub under a foldable umbrella. Life with a newborn in this congested camp, she said, was unbearable. ""I want to go somewhere else,"" she said. But where, she worried. And who would help her reclaim her life?","Four months after massive quake, progress in Haiti is painfully slow .
People are afraid to return to their homes, even if they've been deemed safe .
Life in camps is difficult, but for many, it's the best option they have .
Despite their tremendous suffering, many Haitians hang onto the hope of a better future .",17758 9649 2904 20 240 114 2 7141 13 57 22 175 8 62 7 998 18 10626 9755 2885 4 0 6891 117 10104 44 0 1237 4 0

456,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Flooding caused by monsoon rain has killed more than 400 people across Pakistan, a provincial government official said Friday. Mian Iftikhar Hussain, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province information minister, said the death toll is now 408 people in that province and 25 in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. Qamar-uz-Zaman Chaudhry, the head of the Pakistan meteorological department, told CNN the 300 mm, or 11.8 inches, of rain recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the most ever in Pakistan. Many of the victims died when floodwaters swept away hundreds of mud houses in parts of Swat Valley and the districts of Shangla and Tank, according to Bashir Ahmed Bilour, a provincial minister in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Rushing water also has washed away thousands of acres of crops and dozens of government buildings, local businesses and schools, Bilour said. Hussain said floodwater has cut off the Swat Valley and the districts of Shangla and Peshawar. There is no way to get to these areas by road, he said. Earlier Friday the head of Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority said flooding had killed at least 150 people and injured 90 since Wednesday. Retired Lt. Gen. Nadeem Ahmed said 90 people were still missing. The Pakistani Air Force is helping with rescue efforts, spokesman Tariq Yazdanie said in an interview on Pakistani TV. The recent torrential rains have broken all previous records of rainfall in the country, he said. The U.N. refugee agency dispatched the first shipment of aid for flood victims in the region Thursday, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported. APP said the supplies include 585 tents, 2,700 plastic sheets, 1,760 kitchen sets and 4,000 plastic mats. At the same time, a top official in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province pressed Pakistan's president for help, according to APP. The news agency said Assembly Speaker Karamatullah Khan told legislators he had asked President Asif Ali Zardari for a supply of emergency boats. Photographs from Getty Images showed flood victims struggling to cross a swollen river in the town of Nowshera. The pictures showed children being ferried across the water in overcrowded boats, and more able-bodied people helping the elderly to higher ground. Supplies from the U.N. agency will go first to the two hard-hit villages of Talli and Sultan Kot in Sibi district, APP said. The U.S.-based group Save the Children said it will distribute plastic sheeting for shelters, household supplies and hygiene kits to about 1,000 families over the next two days. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Almost all the deaths are in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, official says .

457,"(CNN) -- The Canadian Coast Guard finished the job of ferrying passengers Monday from a cruise ship that ran aground on an unmapped rock. Officials aboard the Clipper Adventurer reported their troubles Friday. The crew failed to dislodge the ship during high tide on Saturday. Sunday, a Coast Guard icebreaker arrived to transport the people on board to land. ""All 128 passengers were safely transported from the Coast Guard icebreaker, Amundsen, to the community of Kugluktuk"" on Monday, said Theresa Nichols, a spokeswoman with the Canadian Coast Guard. In addition to the passengers, 69 crew members also were on board, according to Nichols. Kugluktuk is a small town on the shore of the Arctic Ocean. Accommodations for the passengers have been arranged by the cruise ship company, said Nichols. The passengers are expected to fly to the Canadian city of Edmonton. The grounded vessel is stable, but rests with a slight list, according to the company that operates the cruise ship, Adventure Canada. The company said that while the passengers were stranded, they were able to enjoy ship-board programs, and some even took in some sun on the disabled ship's deck.","Passengers are taken to a small town on the shore of the Arctic Ocean .

458,"HELSTON, England (CNN)  -- A huge cyclone struck Myanmar in May 2008. It was the largest recorded disaster in that country, killing more than 130,000 people and leaving millions homeless. Since 2001, Tom Henderson's organization, ShelterBox, has supplied aid to more than 600,000 people. ""We were one of the first aid agencies into the country, delivering our ShelterBoxes,"" says Tom Henderson, whose relief package and organization of the same name has aided more than 600,000 victims of disasters of all scales worldwide since 2001. Designed to help an extended family survive for a minimum of six months, the lightweight, weatherproof box contains items such as a 10-person tent, blankets, basic tools, water-purification tablets and containers, a multi-fuel or wood-burning stove, mosquito nets and other items tailored to the particular region in crisis. The ""ShelterBox is designed to be small enough so two people can carry it -- but it has to be large enough to get equipment in for 10 people,"" Henderson explains. ""It's a simple package of aid delivered to the most needy people in the shortest amount of time."" The ex-Royal Navy search-and-rescue diver says the idea behind the ShelterBox came to him ""literally in a heartbeat"" while watching the news in 1999. Henderson was struck by the footage he saw of relief workers dropping food on the ground to victims of a disaster. ""I decided there and then that I would try to make a difference in a more sensible and dignified way,"" he recalls. ""I went to my study and I got a piece of paper out, and I wrote down 'shelter,' 'warm,' 'comfort,' and 'dignity.' And that's where it started."" Though Henderson says people thought he was crazy, he searched around the world for the products he knew would work. In 2000, he brought his idea to the local Helston-Lizard Rotary Club, where members adopted the cause. In January 2001, the first 143 ShelterBoxes were flown to earthquake-ravaged Gujarat, India. Since then, the ShelterBox organization has responded to more than 70 disasters in 46 countries. ""If people have lost everything why should they lose their dignity as well?"" asks Henderson. ""So we were very keen, as well as delivering aid, to give people back their dignity, put them back in control.""  Watch how ShelterBox helps victims of disasters around the world » . The secret of its success is two-fold, explains Henderson. ShelterBox is nonpolitical, accepting no funding from government agencies, and is a worldwide network with communication hubs near every potential disaster site via Rotary International. This allows ShelterBox to respond within 72 hours of a disaster anywhere in the world, subject to customs and local political barriers. According to ShelterBox, each box costs £490 in the United Kingdom and $1,000 in the United States, including all materials, packing, storage and distribution to recipients around the world. Donations from the British public and money raised from Rotary Clubs worldwide help fund the boxes. Watch Henderson reveal the items in a typical ShelterBox » . ""Nobody can buy our boxes, they are only available for free,"" says Henderson. Although Henderson does not travel to drop off boxes or choose where they go, he says he remains motivated by the thought of the millions of people that need help every day, and that if ShelterBox stops delivering aid, people might not survive. Watch Henderson tell the story of a mother and her baby in a ShelterBox » . ""The goal for me was these people,"" he says. ""I had pictures in my mind's eye... [like] children dying in the snow after a disaster. We want this to last for years to come, not just to get them through this disaster, [but] as a springboard for moving forward."" Stories that Henderson hears from the field remind him that ShelterBox is doing just that. Recently, a woman in Kenya gave birth to a baby girl in a ShelterBox tent. ""The ShelterBox became a crib for the baby. And the blankets became blankets for the baby,"" says Henderson.

459,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 28 people are dead and at least 218 others were wounded Wednesday after three blasts during a Shiite procession here, authorities in Pakistan said. Khalid Ranjha, a Lahore government official, said two of the dead are children and two others are women, and seven of those injured are in critical condition. The three explosions occurred within a radius of about 600 meters (2,000 feet). All three blasts were the work of suicide bombers, said Nayab Haider, a spokesman for the Lahore police. Police tried to stop the first suicide bomber as the procession was ending, but he blew himself up as the police officer caught up with him in the crowd, Haider said. Three or four minutes later, the second blast erupted. It was followed 25 minutes later by yet a third suicide bomber. Police have found two heads and one body separately, said Haider, who said authorities had assigned 2,500 police officers to the procession after receiving a warning that it might be attacked. Khusro Pervez, a senior government official, said the incidents took place around the time of the daily breaking of the Ramadan fast, and security may have been lax. ""At the end of the procession, security should have been more vigilant,"" Pervez said. ""The incident happened because of security breach."" Pakistan is a largely Sunni Muslim nation, and the attack on Shiite Muslims conjures thoughts of the long-standing tensions between the two groups in the Middle East and Asia. Paramilitary forces have been deployed to the streets to bring order. Local TV channels showed pictures of angry people burning vehicles, beating police and trying to break into a police station.

460,"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Bermuda's weather officials have relaxed local storm advisories after news arrived that Fiona is downgraded to a tropical depression. But  Gaston, however, can still regain strength in the next two days and become a tropical cyclone, U.S. forecasters said Friday. Fiona's center -- which was expected to pass near Bermuda on Saturday morning -- put officials on alert as it promised heavy winds and downpours. But as of 8 p.m. ET, Fiona's wind speed had decreased to about 16 miles per hour. Fiona's is expected to continue its course north to northeast at about 16 mph with some increase in forward speed, brushing east of Bermuda. Some rainfall is expected.

461,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Intense rain and gushing flood waters threatened Wednesday to cause more misery in monsoon-bloated Pakistan, where 3 million people are already suffering. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Americans to donate to relief efforts, saying that experience in post-earthquake Haiti showed that small donations can make a big difference. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani appealed to residents to curtail expenditures for Ramadan feasts and upcoming independence day celebrations and contribute instead to help their desperate compatriots. As many as 1,500 people have died in Pakistan's worst flooding in 70 years. Relief agencies were struggling to reach people who have lost everything to walls of water. Many were cut off after roads and bridges washed away. Thousands of others were people already displaced by violence in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The flooding also washed away tens of thousands of homes, devastated livestock and swept away farm land. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said it has distributed 10,000 tents so far, along with other relief supplies which have assisted some 50,000 people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. Speaking to reporters in Washington, Clinton stressed the importance of U.S. assistance to Pakistan, a strategically important country whose relationship with Washington continues to be a work on progress. The Obama administration is looking to turn the natural disaster into opportunity, hoping a robust response to the crisis will help improve its poor image among a skeptical Pakistani public. A senior Pakistani military official told CNN that six U.S. helicopters landed at Ghazi airbase Wednesday near the village of Tarbela Ghazi, just north of Islamabad, to participate in the rescue and relief work. The United States has already committed $10 million in aid, and U.S. helicopters have airlifted flood victims and helped deliver critical supplies including temporary bridges and 300,000 halal meals, food that meets Islamic dietary law. ""We've been working hard over the past year to build a partnership with the people of Pakistan, and this is an essential element of that partnership -- reaching out and helping each other in times of need,"" Clinton said. She urged Americans to use their cell phones to text the word ""SWAT"" to the number 50555 to make a $10 contribution to the U.N. refugee agency. The Pakistan Meteorological Department predicted more misery in the days ahead. As much as 2 inches of rain is forecast over the next two days for central Pakistan while scattered showers will continue to fall in the north. Rushing river waters could cause more flooding in downstream areas by this weekend, meteorologists said. In some areas, Pakistanis complained the government has been sluggish to respond. In a special emergency meeting Wednesday, Gilani said the government was doing all it could to address the crisis. People stranded in Tonsa Sharif and Dera Ghazi Khan were still waiting for government relief, reported CNN affiliate Geo TV. Meanwhile, limited access to clean water and poor hygienic conditions raised the threat of widespread acute respiratory infections, diarrhea and skin infections, said the medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres (also known as Doctors Without Borders), which is supporting health units in Mandrakhel, Wadpaga, and Gulbela in the Peshawar district, and the Paddi Hospital in the Nowshera district. Collapsed bridges meant the medical teams were unable to reach the badly hit North Swat region. A case of cholera has been confirmed in Swat.

Hurricane models have Earl passing close to North Carolina's Outer Banks on Thursday night, the National Hurricane Center said in an 8 p.m. Wednesday forecast. ""Only a small westward deviation of the track to the west would bring the core of the hurricane to the coast,"" it said. The center extended hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings northward through Massachusetts on Wednesday evening and said the storm's track has shifted slightly to the west, closer to North Carolina's Cape Hatteras. Mandatory evacuation orders were issued for Ocracoke Island, on North Carolina's Outer Banks, and Cape Lookout National Seashore, as well as Hatteras Island. Earl had been downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane earlier Wednesday but was judged to be a Category 4 in the National Hurricane Center's forecast on Wednesday at 5 p.m. Earl's maximum sustained winds have increased to near 135 mph and the storm is growing, the National Hurricane Center said. Tropical storm force winds are expected to reach parts of the North Carolina coast by Thursday afternoon, with hurricane force winds arriving by late Thursday, the center said. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said Earl is expected to make its closest pass to Cape Hatteras around 2 a.m. Friday as a Category 3 storm, with hurricane force winds of up to 75 mph expected on the Outer Banks. Large breaking waves of 10 to 15 feet are possible along the coast, with possible storm surge of 2 to 4 feet, along with 3 to 4 inches of rainfall, Morris said. Isolated tornadoes and waterspouts are possible. Tropical storm force winds are expected to reach the coast from Virginia to New Jersey by early Friday. Morris said that Earl will make its closest pass to New Jersey on Friday afternoon as a Category 2 hurricane. The long duration of tropical storm force winds threaten widespread power outages in parts of the South and the mid-Atlantic region, he said. Tropical storm force winds will arrive on Massachusetts' Cape Cod by Friday afternoon. Morris said that hurricane force winds are possible there later on Friday, with Earl making its closest pass to Cape Cod on Friday evening as a Category 1 hurricane. Forecasters have issued a hurricane warning for the area from Bogue Inlet, North Carolina, northeast to the North Carolina-Virginia border, including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds. On Wednesday evening a tropical storm warning for the area between Cape Fear, North Carolina, and Bogue Inlet, was extended from the North Carolina-Virginia border to Sandy Hook, New Jersey. A hurricane watch stretched from the North Carolina-Virginia line up to Cape Henlopen, Delaware, while another hurricane watch covered a chunk of the Massachusetts coast, from Wood's Hole to Sagamore Beach, and includes Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket . A tropical storm watch extends from Sandy Hook, New Jersey to Wood's Hole, Massachusetts, encompassing Long Island Sound and Block Island. A tropical storm watch also covers the area from north of Sagamore Beach, Massachusetts, to the mouth of the Merrimack River. Because of Earl's size, effects of the storm are expected to be widely felt. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 kilometers) from the center, and tropical storm-force winds up to 200 miles (325 kilometers). As of 8 p.m. Wednesday, Earl was centered about 565 miles (910 kilometers) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center said. It was moving northwest at about 18 mph (30 kph). Overnight Tuesday, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration buoy recorded a wave with a 50-foot peak associated with Earl, National Hurricane Center Director Bill Read told reporters. ""The buoy survived it just fine and it's still reporting,"" he said. On Friday, Earl is forecast to move away from the Outer Banks and northward, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. It is not expected to make a direct hit on the coast from Virginia to New Jersey, but heavy rain, high surf and gusty winds are likely. Friday night, Earl will make its closest pass to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and the outlying islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. Again, no direct hit is forecast, but any deviation could bring Earl's center over the area, Hennen said. Earl is expected to make a direct landfall over southern Nova Scotia, Canada, on Saturday morning as a strong Category 1 hurricane. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate said Wednesday he had briefed President Barack Obama on what the agency is doing in preparation for the storm. Teams are in place or on standby to assist each state along the East Coast, he said, and supplies were being moved into two incident support bases to be available if they are needed. Several airlines said Wednesday that fliers to and from cities along the eastern seaboard, from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Bangor, Maine, could reschedule travel in coming days without penalty. Though they have not announced cancellations, Air Tran, American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Delta said they would waive reschedule fees for such travelers. On Ocracoke Island -- a long sliver of land reachable only by ferry -- not everyone was planning to flee as Earl approached. ""A lot of times when [residents] evacuate, it's hard to get back on the island,"" said Brandon Benecki, who tends bar at Howard's Pub on Ocracoke Island. ""It's simpler to just stay here and kind of ride it out."" ""None of my neighbors are leaving,"" one man on Ocracoke Island told CNN affiliate WVEC-TV. ""We're just going to hang in and ride her out."" Some tourists didn't seem deterred either. ""They'll throw us off the island,"" one woman told WVEC. ""That's all right. We'll just camp somewhere else."" However, Paula Schramel, who co-owns the Flying Melon restaurant on Ocracoke with her husband, Michael, said she has made plans to go to Charlotte, North Carolina, where her mother is. The couple are natives of New Orleans, Louisiana, who moved to Ocracoke 10 years ago. Their restaurant specializes in Creole cuisine. Some of Michael Schramel's relatives in New Orleans who lived through Hurricane Katrina are urging them to evacuate, she said. ""They're probably more nervous than we are,"" she said. ""It wakes you up a little bit to the fact that it can be"" dangerous. Once the wind gets to 50 mph, she said, the ferries stop running and ""you're stuck."" Officials are ""running the ferries as fast as they can,"" she said, but some visitors are dragging their feet -- understandably, since it means cutting their vacation short. Earl is also dealing the couple an economic blow, they said, as it's considered the last big week of business for the summer tourism season. The restaurant was busy Tuesday night, Paula Schramel said, but closed on Wednesday once the evacuation order was issued. Michael Schramel said he will leave if Earl becomes a Category 4 storm, and said he is ""a little bit nervous. ... A 4 would be devastating."" ""We are concerned about the storm, and it is important that people aren't here who don't understand the [potential] flooding issues,"" said Alan Sutton, the owner of Tradewinds Bait and Tackle on Ocracoke Island. But for regular residents, he said, the threat of hurricanes is ""just part of living here."" Staff members of Cape Lookout National Seashore in North Carolina also ordered an evacuation Tuesday, according to park Superintendent Russel J. Wilson. The park will be closed to all visitors beginning at 5 p.m. Wednesday, until further notice. Hurricane Earl is approaching the United States just ahead of Labor Day, a holiday weekend that many families spend at the beach. ""Unfortunately, they're just getting started with their vacation and now they have to turn around and go,"" bartender Benecki said. ""However, I think most people do understand why."" Rip currents and dangerous surf will threaten beachgoers all along the East Coast, Hennen said. The hurricane already dealt a glancing blow to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, downing trees and knocking out power lines. The hurricane center said Earl's center is set to pass east and northeast of the Bahamas on Wednesday and Wednesday night. A tropical storm warning for San Salvador Island in the central Bahamas was discontinued Wednesday afternoon. Sixty-six members of the North Carolina National Guard have been told to report Wednesday night for storm response duty. They will report to facilities in eastern North Carolina, but away from the coast, said spokesman Maj. Matt Handley. After the storm has moved away, they will assess damage and formulate a response, he said. FEMA has urged those living in the region to prepare for the storm, stock up on supplies and have a plan in case it becomes necessary. Besides FEMA's Ready.gov website, people can use FEMA's mobile application, which links to the National Hurricane Center, to stay up to date on information. Tips include developing a family communications plan, putting together a kit with food and water for 72 hours, and staying informed of risks in the area. Meanwhile, Tropical Depression 9 was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston on Wednesday night, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, the center said. The storm is located in the far eastern north Atlantic Ocean approximately 1,635 miles east-southeast of the Caribbean's Leeward Islands. The depression had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and was heading west at 15 mph (24 kph). It is likely the depression will become Tropical Storm Gaston within 48 hours, forecasters said. And Tropical Storm Fiona was moving out into the open Atlantic on Wednesday, and the center discontinued all watches and warnings related to the storm. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: National Hurricane Center says a ""westward deviation"" could bring storm to land .

463,"(CNN) -- Heavy rains caused flash flooding across the Boston metro area Saturday, stranding cars and causing damage, the National Weather Service reported. No injuries were immediately reported. Flash flood warnings were issued for four counties in eastern Massachusetts, and 2 to 4 inches of rain fell in the region, according to the weather service. There were several reports of cars getting stuck in floodwaters, particularly in the Somerville area, northwest of Boston, where the weather service said at least five vehicles were stranded underneath the Assembly Square Underpass. Video from CNN affiliates WHDH and WCVB showed the vehicles fully submerged beneath the underpass. Drivers had to be rescued from their cars when the tunnel filled with up to 18 feet of water, according to an off-duty police officer involved with the rescue efforts. The officer told WCVB that the water was heavily mixed with sewage. The flooding also forced the closures of at least two bridges. Witnesses told WHDH that cars were also submerged around the bridges and residents waded through water up to their knees. Some locals said they helped direct traffic since lights were knocked out by the storms. The bad weather also disrupted travel for the Boston area transit system. Joe Pesaturo, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, told CNN affiliate WCVB that there were weather-related delays during the afternoon, including the suspension of rail service in one area due to water on the tracks.","Storms cause flash flooding in eastern Massachusetts .

464,"(CNN) -- Three crew members were killed and one was injured Wednesday when a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crashed in waters near James Island in LaPush, Washington, officials said. The surviving crew member is hospitalized in Seattle with non-life threatening injuries, said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Gary Blore. The helicopter, a MH-60 Jayhawk, was flying to Sitka, Alaska, after departing the Coast Guard Air Station in Astoria, Oregon. ""The Coast Guard lost communication with the helicopter around 9:30 a.m. PT (12:30 p.m. ET),"" said Blore. ""Rescue crews were launched shortly after that."" The survivor was pulled from the water by a good samaritan and transferred to a medical facility, said the Coast Guard. The recovery phase for those killed is continuing, said Blore. ""The helicopter is in the water, inverted,"" he said. ""There are power lines down at the beach."" The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a flight restriction in the area near the crash to allow response crews to search without distractions, said the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard will conduct an investigation to determine the cause of the accident, said Blore. With his voice cracking at times, Blore told reporters at a media briefing Wednesday afternoon that accidents such as this are deeply personal to members of the Coast Guard. ""We all have flown helicopters, we have flown the same machine. This hits close to home,"" he said. CNN's Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","Helicopter crashed near James Island off La Push, Washington .

465,"(CNN) -- With nearly 86,000 people evacuated from fire-ravaged regions, Russian authorities said Sunday that firefighters were gaining control over blazes sweeping across thousands of acres in western Russia. ""Despite complicated weather conditions, the situation is under control thanks to preventive measures and efforts taken by the Russian Emergencies Ministry,"" a spokesman for the ministry told the Itar-Tass news agency. At least 28 people have been killed and thousands left homeless by the wildfires, which are among the worst ever to hit western Russia. No fire-related deaths were reported since Friday, officials said Sunday. Two firefighters were among the dead, Itar-Tass reported, citing the Emergency Ministry. Latest figures from the ministry showed that 128,500 hectares (317,530 acres) were burned or had burned, and 774 ""hotbeds of wildfire"" were counted as of 6 a.m. Sunday. About half the fires had either been extinguished or contained, the ministry spokesman said. ""The most difficult situation with wildfires remains in the Nizhny Novgorod, Vladimir and Voronezh regions and the Republic of Mordovia, where fires threaten several populated settlements,"" the ministry's information department said. A hot, dry summer has been a key factor in the fires, drying out large parts of land and igniting the peat bogs that lie all over central Russia. Moscow, Russia, hit a temperature of 39 Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) on Thursday, the highest temperature since records began in 1879. The fires have destroyed more than 1,200 homes, the ministry said, and nearly 5,000 people have been left homeless. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from the village of Maslovka, Russia, near Voronezh, that almost every house in the village of 500 people had burned to the ground. All the residents of Maslovka had been evacuated to nearby hotels. A resident of Maslovka named Nina told Chance she had returned to the village after the fire to sift through the rubble of the house where she was born. For 50 years, she said, she lived under the same roof. A few days ago, the wildfires were swept by high winds to the village and quickly engulfed her house. Now there was nothing left. Even the clothes she was wearing were not hers -- they had been given to her by a neighbor. As Nina told her story, an elderly woman walked from behind a broken wall, wailing with tears. Nina said the woman was her mother, devastated she had lost the home where she raised her family. Russia's government has vowed to compensate the more than 1,870 families whose houses have been burned down. Amid complaints, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered regional governors to speed up the compensation process. The Kremlin has called the wildfires a natural disaster of the kind that appear every 30 or 40 years. Critics, meanwhile, accuse local authorities of mismanaging the response. Desperate to control the blazes, Russia says its deployed nearly a quarter of a million people to fight the fires.

467,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was rushed to the hospital after her husband found her ""unresponsive"" Tuesday morning, her publicist told CNN. Gabor, 93, was taken by ambulance from her Bel Air, California, home to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she had undergone hip replacement surgery earlier this summer, publicist John Blanchette said Tuesday. The spokesman for Gabor's daughter Francesca Hilton said the doctor told Hilton the situation was ""not life-threatening."" Gabor was hospitalized for several days earlier this month for complications relating to the surgery. Her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, was ""very agitated"" after calling for an ambulance Tuesday morning, Blanchette said. Gabor had returned home from the hospital two weeks ago because she ""wants to spend her final days at her home,"" Blanchette said at the time. She spent three weeks in the hospital after breaking her hip in a fall from her bed on July 17. She has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, said Von Anhalt. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge;"" ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""

468,"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- Forecasters predict the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season will be ""near-normal,"" with four to seven hurricanes likely, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday, less than two weeks before the season begins. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters predict a 'near normal' hurricane season. ""While we cannot prevent hurricanes, we can prepare, and we must,"" Commerce Secretary Gary Locke told reporters at Reagan National Airport, just outside of Washington. The Atlantic hurricane season begins June 1 and runs through the end of November. Locke said it is likely there will be nine to 14 named storms, with four to seven of those becoming hurricanes. Of the hurricanes, NOAA predicts that one to three will be major hurricanes -- storms classified as Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale of storm intensity -- with winds of 111 mph or higher. In 2008, there were 16 named storms and eight hurricanes, five of which were major. It was among the busiest and costliest seasons to date, with about $54 billion in damages, according to the National Climatic Data Center.  Learn more about hurricanes and how you can stay safe » . The weather agency had predicted a total of 12 to 16 storms last year. NOAA's predictions for 2009 are similar to those of four other organizations: AccuWeather, (13 named storms and eight hurricanes), Colorado State University, (14 named storms and seven hurricanes) WSI Corp. (13 named storms, seven hurricanes) and Weather Research Center (seven named storms, four hurricanes). Competing climate factors are shaping the 2009 seasonal outlook, NOAA said, saying enhanced rainfall over West Africa, warmer Atlantic waters and reduced wind shear encourage greater storm activity. Should El Nino develop in the equatorial eastern Pacific this summer, or if ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Atlantic stay cooler, storm activity could be diminished, NOAA said. The weather agency will release an updated hurricane outlook in August, ahead of what it says is historically the peak period for hurricane activity. Newly appointed Federal Emergency Management Agency director Craig Fugate emphasized that people who live in coastal areas should prepare for the hurricane season. ""We cannot tell you where a hurricane is going to hit this year, and there's a lot of our coast that hasn't had a hurricane in decades. People grow up in areas and haven't had a hurricane, and live in a hurricane prone area and don't realize it,"" Fugate said. ""Hurricane season is upon us, and to anyone who lives or works in hurricane-prone areas, to any of you who have family or friends in hurricane prone areas, NOAA's message is clear -- be prepared, have a plan,"" NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said. The first named storm of the Atlantic season will be named Ana. CNN's Greg Clary contributed to this report.","NOAA predicts four to seven hurricanes, with one to three major storms .

469,"(CNN) -- The morning after a masked gunman killed two people and wounded six more at a party, police in Indianapolis, Indiana, were still on the scene investigating, authorities said Tuesday. Indianapolis police said the victims were Barbara Johnson, 37, who lived at the home where the shots were fired, and Charles Mays, 54, also of Indianapolis. Investigators had found two cars that may be related to the incident, Indianapolis police Lt. Jeff Duhamell said Tuesday. Police have recovered a silver/green Chrysler 300 sedan ""that had been shot several times"" that may be the suspect's vehicle, an Indianapolis police news release said. The vehicle was found parked and unoccupied and was towed for further investigation, it said. Earlier in the morning, investigators found a silver Dodge Charger that they believe was initially at the crime scene, and then was driven away by someone attending the party, Duhamell said. Video from CNN affiliate WISH showed the vehicle was riddled with bullets. But no one inside that vehicle was wounded, the news release said. The incident happened in the ""near northwest"" part of the city, in a neighborhood rife with gun violence, drugs and prostitution, Indianapolis police Sgt. Michael Jefferson said. Seven victims were found outside the house where the party was going on. The eighth victim was found in a vehicle less than a mile away. ""It makes you sick. And it makes you wonder, 'Why are people so bent on killing each other, shooting each other? For what?'"" an unidentified neighbor told CNN affiliate WISH. ""I don't know what's going on, what's happening in our neighborhood. Hopefully, we can get some help over here. And the young people have taken over. They're doing whatever they want to do."" Read, watch WISH's coverage . Witnesses said that around midnight, at least one person got out of a car, put on a mask and fired what appeared to be an assault rifle at a crowd gathered at the party, Duhamell said. ""Unfortunately, two people were killed,"" he told WISH. ""We're talking at least 25-30 rounds from a high-powered rifle, so although eight people were shot, it could've been a lot worse."" The six other gunshot victims, all Indianapolis residents, were rushed to hospitals, Duhamell said. Clarian Health spokesman Gene Ford said Tuesday morning that four patients had been brought to Methodist Hospital. Tamera Williams, 32, and Nakeisha Morris, 24, were treated and released, he said, and he was unable to disclose information on Jewel Dotson, 21, and Prinsonia Johnson, 54. Wishard Hospital received two victims. Willie Battles, 28, was treated and released, while Kendall Hill, 25, remained in the intensive care unit in good condition, hospital spokesman Todd Harper said Tuesday morning. Police had initially been sent to the vicinity of the party around 10 p.m. Monday after they received a call about a person toting an automatic weapon, Jefferson said. Investigators were still searching for the gunman Tuesday morning and trying to determine if others were involved.

470,"Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina (CNN) -- Weakening by the hour but still covering a massive area, Hurricane Earl spun off the North Carolina on Thursday night, lashing parts of the Outer Banks with rain and high wind. People along the East Coast made just-in-case preparations despite the waning power of the storm. The hurricane has been downgraded to a Category 2 storm, the National Hurricane Center said Thursday night, but warned that ""Earl is expected to remain a large and strong hurricane as it passes near the Outer Banks"" of North Carolina. Hurricane warnings and watches stretched from North Carolina to Delaware and into Massachusetts, where a hurricane warning was issued for Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and the surrounding area. A hurricane watch was also issued for the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. Tropical storm watches and warnings were in effect for most other coastal areas between North Carolina and Nova Scotia. iReport: Share your images and information . As of 8 p.m., the center of Earl was about 160 miles (260 kilometers) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and about 625 miles (1,005 kilometers) south-southwest of Nantucket. It was heading north at about 18 mph (30 kph). A tropical storm warning is now in effect for the coast of Massachusetts from north of Hull to the Merrimack River, and for the coast of Maine from Stonington to Eastport. The tropical storm warning from Cape Fear to west of Surf City, North Carolina, has been discontinued. The storm, which had been a Category 3 until Thursday night, has maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (168 kph), the Hurricane Center reported just before 11 p.m. ET. Further weakening is expected overnight, forecasters said, but ""Earl is expected to remain a large and strong hurricane as it passes near the Outer Banks."" Two more tropical systems are in the Atlantic -- Fiona and Gaston. Fiona is on track for Bermuda, and as of Thursday afternoon, Gaston wasn't threatening any land. Read more on Gaston and Fiona . But for now, all eyes are on Earl. President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration for North Carolina on Wednesday evening. The action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts and makes federal funds available. Maryland's governor issued an emergency declaration earlier in the day. The monster storm is forecast to pass close to the Outer Banks on Thursday night, the National Hurricane Center said. ""Even if the center of Earl remains offshore ... hurricane force winds are expected to occur in the Outer Banks overnight tonight,"" the center said in its 8 p.m. Thursday forecast. The storm is expected to take aim at southeastern New England on Friday night. ""Hurricane force winds are expected within the Hurricane warning area in Massachusetts Friday night,"" the center said Thursday. Officials in Dare County, North Carolina, issued mandatory evacuation orders Thursday for visitors to the coastal county, including the Outer Banks. The mandatory evacuation extended to residents in some areas, including the town of South Nags Head and Hatteras Island. Dare County schools and courts were closed Thursday and will be closed Friday. Earl concerns homeowners along coast . ""Early this evening Hatteras Island will begin feeling the impact of Hurricane Earl's approach,"" the county said in a statement Thursday evening. ""Throughout the evening, weather conditions will progressively deteriorate ... until the storm leaves the area around daybreak Friday morning."" ""Hurricane Earl will produce high seas, ocean overwash, dangerous rip currents, and strong winds,"" it said. On Thursday night, Dare County Manager Bobby Outten told CNN that ""evacuations went well."" ""We got everybody off Hatteras [Wednesday],"" he said, referring to one coastal island. In other nearby areas, Outten said, ""I'm sure there are people holding out."" ""Residents of Dare County have been through this many times,"" the county's emergency response coordinator, Warren Judge, said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""And they have their own individual practices and procedures to get their homes and businesses secured and prepared for the oncoming storm. What we need to happen now is for the visitors to heed the warning, to evacuate."" Earl is a large storm, meaning effects will be widely felt even if it does not make a direct hit. It covers about 166,000 square miles -- larger than California, which covers just under 160,000 square miles. The storm's outflow, or the clouds associated with it, could stretch from one end of the state of Texas to the other, said CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. The North Carolina coast should begin experiencing tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph by Thursday evening, forecasters said, with hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph arriving later. Local coverage by CNN affiliate WECT . ""Conditions are going to deteriorate rapidly,"" FEMA administrator Craig Fugate said Thursday, and people should not be lulled into thinking Earl is going to miss them. ""We have teams in all coastal states ready to support (governors) all the way up the New England States,"" Fugate told CNN Thursday night, describing FEMA's standby teams. ""We're not going to wait till things get bad."" Large breaking waves of 10 to 15 feet are possible along the coast, with possible storm surge of 2 to 4 feet and 3 to 4 inches of rainfall, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Isolated tornadoes and waterspouts are possible. The National Hurricane Center said those in the hurricane warning area -- coastal North Carolina from Bogue Inlet up to the Virginia state line, including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds -- could see storm surge of 3 to 5 feet. However, the most severe part of Earl is expected to remain offshore, which might mean a lower storm surge, according to CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""The fact that it happens overnight always gives us cause for concern,"" Judge said. ""But we're going to get a glancing blow."" He said he hoped the storm will not deal a direct hit to the area and will pass through quickly. ""This is my first hurricane and I'm looking forward to it, "" said Sarah Baker, a native of Oklahoma who works for a vacation rental company in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. ""The locals have been really nice, telling me what I needed to buy to get ready."" Rip currents and stormy seas were reported all the way up the East Coast, from Florida to Maine. Earl will make its closest pass to New Jersey on Friday afternoon, Morris said. It is expected to make its closest pass to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on Friday night as a Category 1 hurricane. Tourist towns on Cape see effects from Earl . The long duration of tropical-storm-force winds threatens widespread power outages in parts of the South and the mid-Atlantic region, he said. Earl is expected to make a direct landfall over southern Nova Scotia on Saturday morning as a strong Category 1 hurricane. The storm will turn northeast as it collides with a cold front, said National Hurricane Center director Bill Read. But the hurricane was undergoing a phenomenon known as eyewall replacement, in which the existing eyewall weakens and a new one forms. That means the eye likely will grow in diameter and the storm will grow even larger as hurricane force winds stretch farther out, he said. Several airlines said Wednesday that passengers to and from cities along the Eastern Seaboard, from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Bangor, Maine, could reschedule travel in coming days without penalty. Though they have not announced cancellations, Air Tran, American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Delta said they would waive reschedule fees for such travelers. North Carolina Gov. Bev Purdue urged residents and visitors to prepare for the storm and heed evacuation orders. Indeed, some people were stocking up on food at grocery stores and attaching plywood to windows and doors of coastal homes. However, others thumbed their noses at Earl, set to arrive just ahead of the Labor Day holiday, and said they were staying put. ""We're from Michigan, so we're used to storms,"" one man said. ""But this is our first hurricane, so we're kind of excited about it and hope everything goes well."" ""I got three bottles of wine hidden in there,"" another man said, gesturing toward his grocery bags. ""The kids are good with the milk."" He said Earl ""might ruin some beach time ... looks like it's OK, but we'll keep an eye on the TV."" One sign on the Outer Banks warned, ""Earl, you are not welcome here."" CNN's Angela Fritz and Randy Harber contributed to this report.","NEW: Just before 11 p.m. ET, sustained winds reported at 105 mph .

471,"Durham, North Carolina (CNN) -- The earthquake of 2010 is not the first one of this magnitude in Chile's long, traumatic history. Almost 50 years ago, I was watching a soccer match in the National Stadium in Chile's capital when, seconds after a gigantic rumble from under the ground terrified the 60,000 fans attending the game, the mountains suddenly disappeared. I am not exaggerating: The stadium was rocked like a cradle and rose in the air, blotting out my view of the Andes, and then, fortunately for all of us, settled back to stability. We had just been through what is still considered, at 9.6 on the Richter scale, the greatest seismic activity ever recorded. We soon learned that the epicenter had been more than 400 miles south of Santiago and that the devastation was massive. On top of the quake itself, which had flattened towns and killed thousands, a tsunami had swept our coast, causing even more havoc. A few months later, when I traveled to that region, I saw for myself the masts of large sunken ships in the Valdivia River many miles inland, and the remains of colossal iron-smelting ovens in Corral that had been twisted beyond recognition by the rush of the invading waters. The human toll was unbearable. From the survivors, I heard of men, women, children heading for the hills and being sucked out to sea as if they were driftwood. I remember all this now so many decades later as I watch, this time from afar, this time from the safety of my home in the United States, yet another ruinous earthquake destroy my country. I remember el gran terremoto de 1960 to offer myself some sort of historical perspective on the recent earthquake, offer myself some trembling ground, so to speak, beneath my feet, as I try to come to terms with the possible meaning of what has just happened. It is obscene to compare cataclysms as if they were contestants in a horror show -- this one cost so many billions, that one cost so many lives -- and yet, to measure what has changed in Chile between these two major disasters in the intervening half century may help us to answer what is, after all, the most urgent question of the moment: What lies ahead? Chile is today a far more prosperous country than it was 50 years ago. Its economy is considered the most dynamic and advanced in all of Latin America -- even though still ravaged now by a grossly unfair distribution of income. This relative affluence of Chile (the GDP today is 15 times more than in 1960!) leaves us better equipped to deal with our current catastrophe, as we have human and scientific resources that we could scarcely have dreamt of back then, to the point that our wonderful outgoing president, Michele Bachelet, initially informed the international community that the country would not require foreign assistance (she has since modified that stance and aid from abroad is starting to arrive). Paradoxically, however, Chile's advances in technology, its abundance of material goods, its many highways and bypasses, its enormous fleet of planes and cars and high-rises, leaves much more of the land and many more of its citizens open to distress, and makes the economy more vulnerable. The richer you are, the harder your potential fall. The more roads you have, the more cracks in the pavement. This wealth, furthermore, has not been accumulated without severe social consequences. Back in 1960, the whole nation came together to rebuild the country. I spent the month after the earthquake, like many university students, collecting money, food, blankets and mattresses that were sent down to the south in caravans filled with enthusiastic volunteers. It was a lesson in solidarity that I have never forgotten -- those who were most deprived gave so much, cared so much, sacrificed so much for their wounded compatriots. If Chile is more opulent now, it has also become a more egocentric and individualistic society where, instead of a vision of social justice for all, the citizenry is, for the most part, engaged in a frenzied race toward ever more consumption and subject, of course, to the accompanying stress and anomie. Like all major misfortunes, the current tragedy of Chile can be seen as a test, a chance to ask ourselves who we really are, what really matters as we rebuild, not only our wrecked hospitals and broken roads and fractured bodies, but our damaged identity. I believe that the deepest wells of that solidarity and fellowship I witnessed when the earthquake of 1960 reduced my land to rubble is still inside most of the people of Chile, and will constitute the main source of our efforts to lift our country up from its desolation, the reason why we may be able to once again prevail, as so many times in the past, against the forces of blind nature. Fifty years ago, the people of Chile found a way to survive all that death and destruction and I can only hope that this time we can painfully, painstakingly, even joyfully, do it again.

472,"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- A car bomb in the Russian republic of Dagestan killed a driver and injured a government official and his two bodyguards on Saturday, state-run news agencies said. Bekmurza Bekmurzayev -- Dagestan's minister of national policy, Information and external relations -- received minor, non life-threatening, injuries, Itar-Tass reported. Investigators said the victims were headed to work in two cars from the minister's apartment in Makhachkala, the region's capital, when a device at the bottom of one of the vehicles exploded seconds later and caused a fire. It wasn't clear which car Bekmurzayev was riding in. Bekmurzayev was targeted because of his work, Itar-Tass said. Similar attacks in 2003 and 2005 killed his two predecessors, Russia Today said. Moscow has been targeting terrorism in Dagestan and other regions of the Caucasus, such as Ingushetia and Chechnya. In recent years, Dagestan has faced ethnic friction, spillover from the discord in neighboring Chechnya and attacks on government officials by Islamists, the International Crisis Group said.","Dagestan is in the turbulent Caucasus region .

473,"Naoma, West Virginia (CNN) -- Recovery crews worked in a West Virginia coal mine Monday, hoping to bring out by late afternoon the last nine bodies remaining there out of the 29 miners who died in an explosion a week ago, officials said. Authorities redirected airflow in the mine to decrease methane levels that had impeded recovery efforts on Sunday, said Jama Jarrett, spokeswoman for the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training. Thirteen bodies were removed Sunday, and rescue teams re-entered the mine around midnight. Officials predicted the remaining nine bodies would be removed by 4 or 5 p.m. Monday, Jarrett said. While a state and federal investigation began immediately after the blast at the Upper Big Branch South Mine, officials cannot fully study conditions inside the mine until the bodies are removed, said Jimmy Gianato, West Virginia director of homeland security. The U.S. flag will be lowered to half-staff at all federal buildings in West Virginia for a week to honor the miners, according to a proclamation signed Monday by President Obama. Hours after rescue efforts at the mine turned into a recovery operation Saturday, Obama urged a thorough investigation into the cause of the explosion, saying, ""We cannot bring back the men we lost. What we can do, in their memory, is thoroughly investigate this tragedy and demand accountability."" Crews on Saturday found the bodies of the last four miners who were unaccounted for after the blast. The death toll previously had stood at 25. The mining disaster was the worst in the United States since 1972, when 91 miners died in a fire at the Sunshine Mine in Kellogg, Idaho. West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, in an audio message released Sunday, offered prayers for those affected by the explosion and the families of the dead, and praised the perseverance of the rescue workers. ""You have our deepest sympathies, our deepest support,"" Rockefeller said, ""and please know that all of us grieve for your loss."" Obama plans to meet with Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and a Mine Safety and Health Administration official to hear their initial assessment of what caused the blast, along with their recommendations for steps the federal government should take to improve safety. Richmond, Virginia-based Massey Energy Co., which owns the mine, said in a statement released Friday that it will conduct ""extensive"" reviews of the mine accident ""to ensure that a similar incident doesn't happen again."" Some have pointed to Massey's safety record in the wake of the blast. But the company said the mine has had less than one violation per day in inspections by MSHA and added the rate is ""consistent with national averages."" Most of the blast victims were working in an area where long-wall cutting was taking place. The technique uses a large grinder to extract the coal and creates large amounts of coal dust and methane gas, both of which are explosive. West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin said Saturday that even though the cause of the explosion is unclear, there needs to be a focus on better ventilation and on sensors to alert mine personnel when gas levels become dangerous. ""We are going to get to the bottom of this, because families should never have to pray, as they send their loved ones to work every day, that those loved ones will in fact return,"" Rockefeller said Sunday. ""Our heroic coal miners have lost too many brothers and too many sisters, and now we must stop all of this."" CNN's Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.","NEW: Officials hope to have all bodies removed by late afternoon Monday .

474,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- A United Parcel Service cargo plane crashed in an unpopulated area near the Dubai airport, killing the two crew members on board, UPS officials said Friday. The 747-400, a UPS-operated cargo plane, crashed with two pilots about 8 p.m. as it took off for Cologne, Germany, UPS officials reported Friday. ""Safety is a key priority for UPS,"" the company's airline and international operations manager, Bob Lekites, said in a statement. ""Our thoughts go out to the crewmembers involved in the incident and their families,"" he said. Lekites said he would release more information as it became available, but only in cooperation with government authorities. ""We will not speculate about the cause. Until then, we ask for your patience in this difficult time,"" he said. The UAE General Civil Aviation Authority said the plane crashed in an area between Emirates Road and Al Ain highway, catching fire, WAM reported. The agency issued a statement saying the bodies of the two pilots were recovered, according to WAM. The National Transportation Safety Board said Friday it will send an investigator to assist local officials as they search for clues on what caused the crash, board officials said Friday.

475,"(CNN) -- Officials declared a state of emergency Saturday after a powerful predawn earthquake struck near Christchurch, New Zealand, sending people into the streets as windows exploded, water mains broke and buildings crumbled. No deaths were immediately reported. The Christchurch City Council declared a state of emergency in response to what it called ""significant damage,"" just hours after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake rattled residents. The order allows authorities to force evacuations and prohibit entry into areas believed unsafe. Officials in Selwyn, a rural district near where the quake hit, also declared a state of local emergency. A curfew from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. was in place, and the army was assisting local police to ensure there is no looting. Roughly 100 people were being treated for minor bumps and cuts after the strong quake, hospital officials said. Two people suffered more serious injuries. ""The house felt like it was on wheels, like it was rolling around on marbles,"" resident Hadlee Wright told CNN's Rick Sanchez. Pictures that Wright took of the city before daybreak showed collapsed buildings and streets littered with bits of brick and rock. The facade of one structure was almost entirely torn off. Power was out in the northwest part of the city, while water and sewage services have been affected in several regions, the Christchurch Civil Defense Group said in a statement. Roads also were damaged. Images taken by Jimmy Le Comte, and sent to CNN's iReport, showed flooding in New Brighton, a Christchurch suburb. In one, a giant crack cuts across a road. The quake had a magnitude of 7.0, down from an initial assessment of 7.4, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It struck about 35 miles from Christchurch, a city with a population of some 386,000 people on the east coast of South Island. An aftershock with a magnitude of 5.7 struck not far from the epicenter about 20 minutes later, the survey said. A man in his 50s was hit by a falling chimney, while another suffered serious injuries after being cut by glass, said Michele Hider, a spokeswoman with Christchurch Hospital. Sebastian Koga, a hospital neurosurgeon, said roughly 100 people were being treated for minor injuries. He was not aware of any deaths. ""We've had a flood of lacerations and minor head injuries, but nothing that could not be handled,"" Koga said. Civil Defense Minister John Carter said the country's prime minister is headed to Christchurch to assess the earthquake damage. ""We don't know entirely what level of issues we're dealing with at the moment. We're still getting reports on it, but it has been extensive,"" Carter told CNN affiliate TVNZ. ""We were lucky that the impact on the people from a death point of view has not been what it could have been under normal circumstances."" The earthquake struck at 4:35 a.m. Saturday (12:35 p.m. ET Friday), when few people would have been out and about. Police said there was some initial looting activity, but that it was quickly brought under control. A man who was at the international airport in Christchurch described the scene. ""The entire terminal started shaking,"" he said. ""I knew it was an earthquake. There was not much you could do at that point."" Authorities evacuated the airport, he said, adding that he saw minor damage. Reinier Eulink, general manager of the Holiday Inn in Christchurch, said there is damage around the hotel corridors and ""big cracks in the walls."" ""It was a big big long jolt, and the building moved a lot,"" he said. The 13-floor building, with about 150 rooms, was about 40 percent occupied, and he estimated that 80 or more people were staying at the hotel at the time. Power was knocked out, but emergency power came on, Eulink added. People were milling around in the hotel lobby, trying to get warm during the chilly Southern Hemisphere winter. The quake was 7.5 miles deep, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the event is not likely to generate a tsunami. Prime Minister John Key told CNN affiliate TVNZ it would likely be some time before the full cost of the quake could be calculated. He sought to reassure residents. ""We're not going to let Christchurch suffer this great tragedy on its own,"" said Key. CNN's Nick Valencia, Mark Bixler, Joe Sterling and Katy Byron contributed to this report.","NEW: Prime minister says government will not abandon Christchurch .

476,"(CNN) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency investigating drinking water contamination in Pavillion, Wyoming, found benzene and methane in wells and in groundwater, agency officials said. At a community meeting with well owners, EPA officials revealed Tuesday they found low levels of petroleum compounds in 17 of 19 drinking water wells sampled, and that nearby shallow groundwater was contaminated with high levels of petroleum compounds such as benzene, according to the report. The affected well owners were advised not to drink the water at the recommendation of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and told to use alternate sources of water for drinking and cooking, agency officials said. Meanwhile, the EPA is working with various government partners and EnCana, a natural gas company, to provide affected residents with water and to address potential sources of the contamination, agency officials said. The study included sampling 21 domestic wells within the area of concern, two municipal wells, plus sediment and water from a nearby creek. The EPA also sampled groundwater and soil from pit remediation sites, and produced water and condensate from five production wells operated by the primary natural gas operator in the area, agency officials said. No health concerns were found related to inhalation exposure to chemicals while showering or using evaporative coolers, agency officials said. The EPA has not reached any conclusions about the sources of chemical compounds found in drinking water wells, including hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" the controversial process used to extract natural gas from underground, agency officials said. Officials are uncertain if the contaminated shallow groundwater will migrate to the drinking water aquifer, according to the report. ""EPA will work as long as necessary to ensure that Pavillion residents have safe water,"" Jim Martin, EPA's regional administrator in Denver, said in a statement released Tuesday. ""While our investigation continues, EPA has secured commitments from our partners to identify alternate sources of water for affected homes and to evaluate long-term solutions."" In addition to detecting several petroleum hydrocarbons, the EPA found a number of ""inorganic constituents"" such as sodium and sulfates in drinking and groundwater wells, according to the report. In spring 2008, residents of Pavillion -- concerned about the quality of their drinking water -- contacted the EPA in Denver, Colorado. The agency sampled 39 individual wells (37 residential wells and two municipal wells) in March 2009 and found nitrate, arsenic and methane gas. The agency conducted the second sampling in January 2010. Over the past week, officials from EPA and the federal agency for toxic substances met privately with individual residents to provide health information and recommendations based on well-specific sampling results, agency officials said.","Residents of a Wyoming town became concerned about well water in 2008 .

477,"(CNN) -- Officials declared a state of emergency Saturday after a powerful predawn earthquake struck near Christchurch, New Zealand, sending people into the streets as windows exploded, water mains broke and buildings crumbled. No deaths were immediately reported. The Christchurch City Council declared a state of emergency in response to what it called ""significant damage,"" just hours after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake rattled residents. The order allows authorities to force evacuations and prohibit entry into areas believed unsafe. Officials in Selwyn, a rural district near where the quake hit, also declared a state of local emergency. A curfew from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. was in place, and the army was assisting local police to ensure there is no looting. Roughly 100 people were being treated for minor bumps and cuts after the strong quake, hospital officials said. Two people suffered more serious injuries. ""The house felt like it was on wheels, like it was rolling around on marbles,"" resident Hadlee Wright told CNN's Rick Sanchez. Pictures that Wright took of the city before daybreak showed collapsed buildings and streets littered with bits of brick and rock. The facade of one structure was almost entirely torn off. Power was out in the northwest part of the city, while water and sewage services have been affected in several regions, the Christchurch Civil Defense Group said in a statement. Roads were also damaged. Images taken by Jimmy Le Comte, and sent to CNN's iReport, showed flooding in New Brighton, a Christchurch suburb. In one, a giant crack cuts across a road. The quake had a magnitude of 7.0, down from an initial assessment of 7.4, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It struck about 35 miles from Christchurch, a city with a population of some 386,000 people on the east coast of South Island. An aftershock with a magnitude of 5.7 struck not far from the epicenter about 20 minutes later, the survey said. A man in his 50s was hit by a falling chimney, while another suffered serious injuries after being cut by glass, said Michele Hider, a spokeswoman with Christchurch Hospital. Sebastian Koga, a hospital neurosurgeon, said roughly 100 people were being treated for minor injuries. He was not aware of any deaths. ""We've had a flood of lacerations and minor head injuries, but nothing that could not be handled,"" Koga said. Civil Defense Minister John Carter said the country's prime minister is headed to Christchurch to assess the earthquake damage. ""We don't know entirely what level of issues we're dealing with at the moment. We're still getting reports on it, but it has been extensive,"" Carter told CNN affiliate TVNZ. ""We were lucky that the impact on the people from a death point of view has not been what it could have been under normal circumstances."" The earthquake struck at 4:35 a.m. Saturday (12:35 p.m. ET Friday), when few people would have been out and about. Police said there was some initial looting activity, but that it was quickly brought under control. A man who was at the international airport in Christchurch described the scene. ""The entire terminal started shaking,"" he said. ""I knew it was an earthquake. There was not much you could do at that point."" Authorities evacuated the airport, he said, adding that he saw minor damage. Reinier Eulink, general manager of the Holiday Inn in Christchurch, said there is damage around the hotel corridors and ""big cracks in the walls."" ""It was a big big long jolt, and the building moved a lot,"" he said. The 13-floor building, with about 150 rooms, was about 40 percent occupied, and he estimated that 80 or more people were staying at the hotel at the time. Power was knocked out, but emergency power came on, Eulink added. People were milling around in the hotel lobby, trying to get warm during the chilly Southern Hemisphere winter. The quake was 7.5 miles deep, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the event is not likely to generate a tsunami. Prime Minister John Key told CNN affiliate TVNZ it would likely be some time before the full cost of the quake could be calculated. He sought to reassure residents. ""We're not going to let Christchurch suffer this great tragedy on its own,"" said Key. CNN's Nick Valencia, Mark Bixler, Joe Sterling and Katy Byron contributed to this report.","NEW: Prime minister says government will not abandon Christchurch .

478,"(CNN) -- A small plane with four people aboard crashed Monday in a residential neighborhood of Las Vegas, Nevada, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said. The conditions of the four passengers were not immediately known. The single-engine Piper Cherokee was unable to gain altitude after taking off from Henderson Executive Airport, just south of Las Vegas, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor told CNN. The pilot tried to return to the airport, but crashed on a street in a neighborhood about two miles northwest of Henderson, Gregor said. The plane hit a few cars upon crashing, according to Stacey Welling, a spokeswoman for Clark County. The crash occurred about 8:15 a.m. (11:15 a.m. ET). The plane is registered to a Louisiana resident, but the identities of those aboard were not released. Investigators from the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are expected to arrive at the scene later Monday, Gregor said.","Four people were aboard the plane; their conditions are unknown .

479,"(CNN) -- A blowout preventer that may hold important forensic evidence as to why it failed, triggering the world's largest accidental oil spill, has been brought to the surface of the Gulf and placed on a vessel, officials said Saturday night. The device ""was taken into custody by the U.S. Department of Justice as evidence in its ongoing investigation into the incident,"" BP said. The blowout preventer was lifted to the surface at 8:53 p.m. (9:53 p.m. ET). Adm. Thad Allen, the government's national incident commander, said the huge blowout preventer ""is considered evidentiary material."" The April 20 explosion killed 11 workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig. A new blowout preventer was installed atop BP's plugged well late Friday. Crews had to flush out potential hydrates -- crystals that form in cold temperatures -- before the old blowout preventer was hauled about the Q4000 surface vessel. Joint investigation teams, engineers and the Department of Justice will pore over the recovered device. ""I'm very pleased to announce that with the new blowout preventer on [and] the cement that was previously put in ... this well does not constitute a threat to the Gulf of Mexico,"" Allen said earlier Saturday. He provided details on the installation of the new blowout preventer late Friday. ""This is an important milestone as we move toward completing the relief well and permanently killing the Macondo 252 well,"" he said. Once the new device is successfully tested, BP will drill the last remaining feet of a relief well to intercept the damaged well. Finally, the company will execute a ""bottom kill"" -- a measure that fills the well from the bottom with mud and cement. That is believed to be the only way to seal the well for good.

480,"(CNN) -- Detroit Mayor David Bing called Tuesday's 85 fires in the city a ""natural disaster"" and defended the fire department's response. ""I have ultimate confidence in the Detroit Fire Department,"" he said at a Wednesday afternoon news conference. ""I think they've done an outstanding job."" Asked whether the department was adequately staffed or had enough equipment Tuesday, Bing said the important thing was that no one was hurt or killed. ""I don't care how much money you have. When something like this happens, all you can do is respond,"" he said. Fire Commissioner James Mack Jr. said the department is budgeted for about 500 firefighters, about 20 fewer positions than last year. About 236 firefighters fought Tuesday's fires across much of the city and took no breaks, Mack added. The inferno was a perfect storm, and was aggravated by high winds and downed power lines, the officials said. ""It just created a firestorm where we had fires,"" the fire commissioner said, adding that at least eight of the fires were linked to downed power lines and two to arson, though he said those numbers may change. He said response times might have been slow because of the volume of calls and officials having to prioritize the fires, especially if some were at vacant residences. Monday morning quarterbacking of resources is always easy to do, Mack said. ""I have to balance safety of public and the monies the department has."" CNN iReporter Joe Wilk, who recorded video of flames and their charred aftermath Tuesday and Wednesday, said that one fire spread to about 10 homes in an hour. ""It's pretty tragic. How many people just lost their houses and everything they own?"" he asked. A woman told him that firefighters didn't arrive for an hour to fight the fire, which also destroyed garages. ""A lot of these fires were due to high winds and downed wires,"" said Karen Dumas, a city spokeswoman. ""We had winds from 30 to 50 mph and have a number of downed power wires,"" Mack said. ""We are attributing some of the fires to downed power wires, which makes more fires with the wind being so strong."" Mack said that between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., the fire department responded to 140 calls of wires down before the evening outbreak. Fire officials said Wednesday that there were still hot spots and downed power lines in the city. Fire departments in the neighboring towns of Warren, Dearborn and Harper Woods helped Detroit firefighters. Mack said perhaps he should have asked for help earlier. ""It's a matter of public safety,"" Dumas said.  ""We have enough resources to manage our daily demands, but that was an unusual and concentrated number of fires."" City officials say they will be communicating with DTE Energy about its response to downed power lines. Bing said he was heartened by the community response. ""I want to thank the residents who came and did what they needed to do,"" the mayor said. ""That's one of the cultural changes we are starting to see here in the city. I think our community understands we are all in this together.""","He defends fire department response, staffing .

481,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Boston trolley operator killed in a crash last year likely had a sleep disorder and fell into a ""micro-sleep"" shortly before the collision, the National Transportation Safety Board ruled Tuesday. Since last year's trolley crash in Boston, Massachusetts, there has been another incident on the same line. The safety board, completing a 14-month investigation, faulted operator Ter'rese Edmonds for ignoring a red signal along the tracks but directed harsh criticism at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority which operates the train system. The transit authority failed to screen operators for sleep disorders while enforcing a work schedule that could prevent train operators from getting enough sleep, the NTSB said. The NTSB's conclusion that Edmonds fell asleep is partly conjecture, the board acknowledged. Edmonds, a part-time trolley operator, had an opportunity for adequate sleep the day of the wreck, although investigators were not able to determine her sleep history. In addition, Edmonds had been given a break earlier in the day, had not complained to co-workers about fatigue and was found to be free of drugs and alcohol. ""We cannot say for certain that she did have it (sleep apnea),"" board member Dr. Mitch Garber said. But the NTSB concluded there was a ""high likelihood"" that Edmonds had an undiagnosed sleep disorder, largely because she was obese and because tests showed she had taken doxylamine, an ingredient commonly found in sleep aids, suggesting she had trouble sleeping during at least one of the nights leading up to the accident. In addition, there is a lack of other evidence to explain why Edmonds failed to slow or stop the train, the board concluded. Tests showed that the stopped train could be seen at a distance of 764 feet, and that ""there were multiple opportunities to slow and stop this (advancing) train,"" NTSB investigator Wayne Workman said. ""There was not any evidence that brakes were applied."" Edmonds' westbound train was traveling at 38 mph when it struck the other train, which was traveling at 3 mph in the same direction. An estimated 185 to 200 passengers were on the two trains during the collision in the Boston, Massachusetts, suburb of Newton. Damage was estimated at $8.6 million. The board also noted that the MBTA had not installed systems on its Green Line to prevent two trains from occupying the same stretch of track, the NTSB said. The systems, known as ""positive train control"" systems, would have prevented the accident, the safety board said. One year after the fatal accident, more than 50 people were injured in another accident on the same line. The Boston accident highlights two issues that have risen to the top of the NTSB's concerns in recent years, positive train control and operator fatigue. The safety board says positive train control issues were involved in two other light rail incidents this year, a May 8 wreck on the same MBTA Green Line and a June 22 wreck which killed nine on Washington, D.C.'s Metro system. ""If technology exists... on the other (MBTA) lines, why would the Green Line not have everything possible... to prevent accidents from happening,"" NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker asked. ""I don't understand that as an operator; I just don't."" The Metro system had a form of positive train separation, but investigators are exploring whether that crash resulted from a circuit malfunction. The safety board said fatigue issues affect all forms of transportation. It noted that two pilots fell asleep during a flight over Hawaii and that sleep issues played a role in a Cosco Busan ship incident in San Francisco, California, and a fatal bus crash in Mexican Hat, Utah. Rosenker said details that surfaced in the Boston trolley crash will guide the NTSB in the future. ""Now it is up to us, because we now are the advocates for these changes,"" Rosenker said. Recommendations resulting from the Boston crash ""raise the bar of safety not only in this system, but across the United States.""","Obesity, evidence that operator was taking sleep aid leads to conjecture .

482,"(CNN) -- A leading pet product company has issued a voluntary recall of nearly 75,000 bags of dog treats due to salmonella concerns, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The move by Hartz Mountain Corp. came after random sample testing by the FDA indicated the presence of salmonella organisms in one or more 8-ounce bags of Hartz Naturals Real Beef Treats for Dogs. The company, based in Secaucus, New Jersey, has not received any reports of animals or people becoming ill as a result of contact with the treats, and is investigating the source of the potential contamination. The potentially affected treats are stamped with the lot code BZ0969101E, according to the FDA. Hartz is urging dog owners who have purchased the recalled treats to immediately throw them away. The FDA advises dog owners whose pets are exhibiting such symptoms as fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain and nausea to seek immediate veterinary assistance.

483,"(CNN)  -- Shots were fired Sunday near a motorcade carrying the presidents of Georgia and Poland, but the motorcade was not hit and there were no injuries, according to the Interior Ministry of Georgia. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, shown in France on November 13, called the incident a provocation. The ministry said the motorcade, which carried Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and Polish President Lech Kaczynski, was passing a checkpoint near Georgia's South Ossetia region when the shots were fired. No other shooting was reported in the area. South Ossetia was the site of intense conflict between Russian and Georgian troops in August. The shots were fired from Russian-controlled territory as the motorcade passed, the ministry said. Saakashvili later told reporters the incident ""clearly was intended as a provocation."" He said that he would not have taken his Polish counterpart into danger intentionally and that the incident showed ""you are dealing with unpredictable people"" in the disputed area. Meanwhile, the Russian news agency Interfax said the command of the Russian peacekeeping force in South Ossetia denied blame for the gunfire. ""Allegations that Russian military personnel were involved in the fire against the motorcade are not true. An attack on the motorcade from our military personnel is out of the question,"" a peacekeeping force spokesman said, according to Interfax. The news agency also quoted a senior South Ossetian official as saying that South Ossetia ""has nothing to do"" with the incident. ""The Georgian side is once again disseminating misinformation,"" South Ossetian Deputy Defense Minister Ibragim Gasseyev told Interfax. Tensions have remained high in the area since fighting between Russian and Georgian troops broke out in August. Georgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist territory, on August 7. The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities across the administrative borders with those regions. The two sides blamed each other for starting the conflict and have accused each other of a variety of offenses leading up to and during the fighting, including ethnic cleansing.","NEW: Russian peacekeepers, South Ossetia deny involvement in shooting .

484,"(CNN) -- Several people were injured in a ""flash fire"" at a plant in west-central Tennessee that makes decoy flares for the military, officials said Tuesday. The incident occurred at Kilgore Flares Co. in Hardeman County, about 75 miles northeast of Memphis, said Jeremy Heidt, spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. The plant in Toone, Tennessee, makes materials that are flammable but not explosive, Heidt said. United Kingdom-based Chemring Group, which owns Kilgore Flares, said the fire started at 12:30 p.m. in one of its ""expendable countermeasures assembly facilities."" Three hospitalized employees received burns and one was treated for stress, the company said. But hospitals said they were treating six people. ""Due to the nature of the materials involved, and its proximity to other materials, the emergency services consider it is best to let the fire burn itself out, Chemring said in a statement. ""Once the fire is extinguished, an investigation into the cause of the incident will be undertaken in cooperation with the local authorities."" The Regional Medical Center at Memphis has received three patients, two of them flown in, said executive secretary Jackie Harris. All three were in critical condition with unspecified injuries, she said. Three others were at Bolivar General Hospital in good condition, said spokeswoman Kay Cranford of West Tennessee Healthcare. A receptionist who answered the phone at Kilgore said no local spokesman was available. According to its website, Kilgore Flares makes decoy flares for aircraft and naval forces, many of which are used as countermeasures against heat-seeking missiles. Kilgore Flares is one of the county's largest employers, Hardeman County Mayor Willie Spencer said. A nearby elementary school was locked down after the early afternoon incident and several hundred Kilgore employees were sent home, Spencer said.

486,"(CNN) -- Last Thursday was back-to-school night in many of the communities that dot the peninsula below San Francisco, California. Off-duty firefighters and police officers who went to schools with their children and families soon learned something horrible had happened in a San Bruno residential neighborhood. Speculation ran from an airplane crash, to an earthquake, to terrorism. It was only later that they learned that is was a gas transmission line explosion. South San Francisco firefighter Anthony Ottoboni was at his son's baseball practice when he got the news. ""My wife looked right at me and said, 'Go.'"" Capt. Bill Forester of the San Bruno Fire Department was on duty. ""We looked out the back door and saw a fireball,"" he said. John Priolo, also with the fire department, recalls rushing to work and seeing the ""walking wounded"" arrive at the station. Tuesday, first-responders gathered near the fire site to talk about the heroics of others, including citizens, last week. They spoke of the strong fraternity of the 400 firefighters, paramedics and police officers who thronged to the neighborhood. They mentioned how their training prepared them, but there are some things training can't foresee. ""Somebody said it was like they took a Saturn V rocket and tipped it upside down at the blastoff,"" said Forester. The high-pitched roar of gas sounded like a jet engine, he added. Chaos greeted them as they moved into the area. Many people were running away. Bystanders were taking photos. Always, there was the wall of fire and oppressive heat. ""I realized immediately how overwhelmed we were going to be,"" said Sgt. Mike Guldner of the San Bruno Police Department. Guldner and some civilians helped a seriously injured man. ""Thank God to the people and citizens of San Bruno who stepped up to provide assistance to me,"" Guldner said. Firefighters quickly learned the water mains had been taken out by the explosion. ""It's a sinking feel to say the least because you count on that water being there,"" said Forester. ""If there was ever a time you need it, it was there."" But firefighters improvised, stretching lines from another water grid. The responders, many of whom knew people who lived in the Crestmoor Canyon neighborhood, went to smoke-filled homes, making sure people got out. They were assisted by several residents. ""We got as close to the flame as we possibly can without getting ourselves burned,"" said Officer Ken Chetcuti of the South San Francisco Police. Lt. Ron Carlino of the South Francisco Police Department recalled the dazed homeowners who grabbed a few belongings. ""Some people wanted to grab just anything,"" he said. ""They felt like they couldn't leave empty-handed."" Four people died in the fire and three are still missing, officials said Tuesday. Thirty-seven homes were destroyed. Homeowners have since returned to Crestmoor Canyon and are trying to patch their lives back together. But the people of San Bruno have changed, according to local police officer Scott Rogge. ""We had everyday people running into houses, helping us,"" he said. Since then, the community has received and given donations, opened a shelter, provided food, clothing and more. ""People that normally you see maybe wave -- they are exchanging emails, phone numbers, hugs and tears,"" Rogge said. ""Those are the true heroes, the people of the community... We do this every day. We've chosen to do this. But those people stepped up.""","Residents assisted firefighters and police officers in San Bruno .

Rescue workers were also trying to find 29 people who were still missing after landslides buried some 50 homes with debris, said Priyadi Kardono, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency. The landslides occurred on Tuesday in the area of Ciwidey in the province of West Java after torrential downpours, Kardono said. Rescuers were just able to get heavy machinery to the landslide area Wednesday morning because roadways were clogged. After the landslide: Mud, sweat, tears, death . Hundreds of rescue workers, the police, the army and volunteers dug frantically, some with their bare hands, trying to find survivors although some began feeling their efforts would bring grim results. ""The chances of survival are zero, because this landslide is entirely mud. There will be no chance of air pockets"" said Sumarsono, the Indonesian Red Cross disaster management chief.

488,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Search crews have rescued nine more passengers who survived a ferry capsizing off the coast of Indonesia, though more than 230 people are still missing. A woman grieves after learning her son is one of the victims in the Indonesian ferry accident. The nine survivors were rescued by a navy ship Monday afternoon, bringing the total number of survivors from Sunday's accident to 30, said Col. Jaka Santosa, chief of search and rescue operations for the Indonesian navy. One body was also recovered Monday. The search and rescue operations continued Tuesday, with five navy ships joining the effort. The ferry was carrying 267 people. Rescue efforts have been hampered by severe weather, including heavy rains and strong winds, according to local officials. The Teratai Prima ferry left Pare Pare on Sulawesi island in central Indonesia on Saturday evening for Samarinda, East Kalimantan. The ferry overturned about 4 a.m. Sunday off the coast of Majena in west Sulawesi after being pummeled with waves as high as 19 feet, survivors said. Indonesians rely heavily on ferries, since they are the easiest way to navigate throughout the country's 17,000 islands.

The four most critically injured were taken via air to Westchester Medical Center, according to Prozzillo. Malone said details on the accident were hazy.

490,"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- One of two Taiwanese nationals injured in a shooting at a popular Old Delhi, India, tourist site remained in critical condition Monday after doctors removed a bullet from his abdomen, a hospital official said. Amit Banerjee, the medical superintendent of the hospital where the two tourists were being treated, added the other tourist is expected to be discharged soon. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Australian governments have issued safety advisories to their citizens after the shooting on Sunday. And two of India's largest cities -- Delhi and Mumbai -- are on red alert. Gunmen on a motorcycle fired multiple rounds at a tour bus, Karnail Singh of Delhi police told CNN sister network CNN-IBN on Sunday. ""One of the bullets grazed the head of one tourist and one has been hit in the stomach,"" Singh said. India's tourism minister, Kumari Selja, downplayed Sunday's shooting as a ""stray"" event aimed at creating panic. ""This attack on tourists shows desperation of those elements who want to create panic in the society by attacking innocent people,"" Selja said, according to a statement from her ministry. ""Investigation agencies are at work"" to apprehend the culprits, she said. India, she insisted, is a safe destination for tourists. Police, who continue the search for the suspects, said they think the attack is more likely to be the work of a criminal gang than a terror attack. The attack comes two weeks before the Commonwealth Games, which are expected to draw large crowds to the city. Thousands of athletes from around the world will converge on the city October 3 for the multi-sport event that is held every four years. ""U.S. citizens are urged to always practice good security, maintain a heightened situational awareness and a low profile,"" the U.S. Embassy posted on its website. ""U.S. citizens are advised to monitor local news reports and consider the level of security present when visiting public places, including religious sites."" The message follows a travel alert issued earlier this month about the Commonwealth Games in general: . ""The U.S. Mission in India alerts U.S. citizens traveling to or residing in India to safety and security issues related to the 2010 Commonwealth Games scheduled to be held in New Delhi, India, between October 3 and October 14, 2010, especially in light of the worldwide caution issued by the Department of State on August 12, 2010, regarding the continuing threat of terrorist actions and violence against U.S. citizens and interests throughout the world."" Athletes from more than 70 countries in Africa, North and South America, Asia, Europe, the Caribbean island nations and the South Pacific region are expected to take part in the games, which feature such sporting events as basketball, archery, table tennis, squash, badminton, bowling, gymnastics and swimming. On Monday, Australia warned its citizens in a travel advisory that the event carries a ""high risk of terrorism."" ""Australians in New Delhi should be aware that the Commonwealth Games will be held in a security environment where there is a high risk of terrorism,"" the advisory said. It added that New Delhi has seen at least 14 major terrorist attacks since 2000 in public places, such as markets and train stations. Police in New Delhi insist Sunday's shooting was not targeted at the games. ""It was a local mischief,"" police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said Monday. Security has, however, been stepped up in the Indian capital, he added. ""We assure full security not only for the games but also for the city,"" Bhagat said.

491,"(CNN) -- The storm previously known as Hurricane Igor sped past Newfoundland Tuesday, leaving behind downed trees, washed out roads and a desperate search for a missing elderly man. Igor slipped into a post-tropical status late Tuesday afternoon, losing its hurricane moniker in the process. But the storm still carried hurricane-force winds with a top sustained rate that had jumped to 86 mph (139 kph), according to the Canadian weather office. Sgt. Boyd Merrill of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said that the Mounties have responded to reports that an 80-year-old man was swept out to sea Tuesday morning when his driveway collapsed beneath him from the rain-fed water flow. The incident took place on Random Island near Britannia, Merrill said, and the harsh weather conditions have made the search difficult. With impassable roads and no air or sea travel available, he said, only local residents have been able to search the area. Marine Search and Rescue from St. John's was unable to get a helicopter into the air, and the Canadian Coast Guard vessel Ann Harvey was dispatched to the area and then recalled over safety concerns. A hurricane watch remained in effect for the Newfoundland coast from Stones Cove to Fogo Island, and a tropical storm warning was in effect for the entirety of the coast. But forecasters said they expected the hurricane watch to be discontinued later Tuesday night as the storm moves further from shore. A gust of 90 mph (144 kph) was reported at Bonavista, Newfoundland, according to the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center. Igor's forward speed was slowing -- 27 mph (43 kph) -- and rainfall associated with the storm was decreasing. Igor was still expected to dump a total of 4 to 8 inches on the province, the Hurricane Center said. As of 8 p.m. ET, the center of Igor was about 240 miles (385 kilometers) east-northeast of Gander, Newfoundland. Forecasters said Igor would hold onto its hurricane-force winds for the day or so but gradually weaken as it crosses the into the Labrador Sea and onward to the Davis Strait, which separates Greenland and Canada. ""The center of Igor will continue to move away from the island of Newfoundland,"" forecasters said. It is expected to turn north-northeast and then north and to slow Tuesday night and Wednesday before heading northwest toward Baffin island. Large swells associated with Igor are expected to affect the U.S. East Coast through Tuesday and the southern coastlines of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland for the next couple of days, the Hurricane Center said. Swells will be slowly subsiding in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the island of Hispaniola and portions of the Bahamas over the next couple of days but could cause rip currents and heavy surf, forecasters said. The center of Igor reached its closest point to Bermuda -- about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of the island -- late Sunday night and continued bringing fierce winds to the island on Monday. There were no reports of serious damage, injuries or deaths, but residents experienced widespread power outages. Some might not have power restored for weeks, CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf said, reporting from Bermuda. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Lisa formed Tuesday in the eastern Atlantic Ocean but posed no immediate threat to land. As of 5 p.m. ET, Lisa was barely moving about 535 miles (845 km) west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands, according to the National Hurricane Center. Lisa carried maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph). Forecasters said Lisa could increase rapidly in the next 24 hours.","NEW: Igor no longer a hurricane, but still carries hurricane force winds .

492,"Hassan Khail, Pakistan (CNN) -- The white bags land with a thud, a small cloud of dust billowing around them. But for Pakistanis like Tariq Jan, the simple sack may as well be gold. Each 30-kilogram sack contains enough animal feed to keep a donkey satisfied for a month. Without the United Nations donations, Tariq Jan would have no chance of restarting the life that he lost, washed away by the massive flooding that began in Pakistan almost two months ago. He used to own more than 40 animals. But many of them died when his house and his land drowned under torrents of gushing water. His family depends on the milk from the cows. ""They have gotten much thinner,"" he said of his animals. ""I am having a lot of trouble getting anything to eat for them."" The floodwaters submerged about 10 million acres, much of it in Punjab province, Pakistan's breadbasket, where people live off the soil and their livestock. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has been trucking in animal feed and seeds to plant anew. ""We have to try and and get seeds in here and make sure they can get off food aid as fast as possible,"" the group's Truls Brekke said of the flood survivors. Tariq Jan used to profit from several acres of syrupy sugar cane. But now, without any help, it will take perhaps five years before he can clear the sludge and see new shoots again. But even the food aid is falling short. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced a few days ago that the United Nations is seeking another $1.594 billion for flood victims, bringing the total to more than $2 billion. The world body has received about 70 percent of the $460 million it initially requested. Farther south in Sindh, the floods are still adding to the ranks of the homeless. Every day, the United Nations is seeing 20,000 to 30,000 more people who have just lost their homes to rising waters. In all, more than 20 million people were affected by the floods. Waters from Lake Manchar are overflowing in five directions. Some people are referring to it as a ""lake burst,"" said Fawad Hussain, a U.N. relief coordinator for Sindh. ""First we had the rain, then the waters from the river and now the lake,"" Hussain said. ""We have not been able to scale up [the response] as quickly in the far south due to lack of funding."" There are people marooned in Pakistani villages who are still waiting for help. ""The monsoon rains may be over, but the floods are not,"" said Andro Shilakadze of UNICEF.

494,"(CNN) -- French air traffic controllers went on strike Tuesday as labor unrest continued to roll across Europe despite the suspension of a strike by Lufthansa pilots after just one day. Half of Tuesday's flights at Orly Airport in Paris, France, were canceled, along with 25 percent of flights at Charles de Gaulle Airport, as a result of a planned strike by four civil aircraft staff, including air traffic controllers, for Tuesday through Saturday. Authorities at French airports advised passengers to check with their airlines before traveling to airports. The action comes a day after German-based Lufthansa and its pilots' union agreed to suspend its standoff and return to the bargaining table. The suspension will expire on March 8, barring an agreement before then, both sides said in a Frankfurt labor court. Also on Monday, British Airways cabin crew voted to strike, although no dates were announced. A planned 12-day walkout by Unite, the union which represents the workers, during the Christmas holidays was blocked by a judge. Are you fed up with all the strikes? Unite said it is continuing negotiations with the airline. Like Lufthansa pilots, British Airways staff are concerned about wages and job security as larger, older airlines deal with the twin blows of the global recession and increased competition from low-cost carriers. ""These are not mindless militants looking to bring the company down, these are ordinary, decent people who do a highly professional job, and very evidently they have a deep set of grievances,"" Len McCluskey, assistant general secretary of Unite told CNN. ""We accept that change is needed and we accept that British Airways is in serious financial trouble ... the problem we've got is British Airways decided to impose change instead of doing it through negotiations."" Airline industry: Strike, strike, everywhere a strike . European airlines were not the only ones hurting. Japan Airlines de-listed its shares from trading in Tokyo Saturday as part of its bankruptcy restructuring. And in Australia, Qantas Airlines announced this week it would eliminate first class travel from its flights. Industry watchers expect to see more industrial actions at airlines across the world. ""The [airline] industry is going to be losing approximately $10 billion for 2009, and projected to be over $5 billion in 2010, so you're going to see a lot more of these kinds of issues crop up as airlines try to cut costs in the face of all these losses,"" said Rick Seaney, CEO of Farecompare.com. ""Airlines used to be able to fly with planes a quarter empty, now they have to fill them to capacity, which is causing all kinds of consumer issues as well, which hurts their brand and hurts the industry overall,"" Seaney said. Beyond the airline industry, other labor disputes are spilling into industrial action in Europe. French gas giant Total said about 100 of 4,000 gas stations in the country are beginning to run out of fuel as a strike by oil refinery workers enters a second week. And in Spain, trade unions protested on Wednesday in Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia against a government plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67. It was the first major protest by the unions against Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero since he took office six years ago. Spain is the only major industrial economy still in recession and has one of the European Union's highest unemployment rates, of 19 percent. For workers under 25, the jobless rate is 40 percent, the government reports. The government plan to raise the retirement age to 67 aims to prevent, in the coming decades, the pension system from going bust, as Spaniards live longer and collect retirement benefits for longer periods, with a project declining number of workers paying in to the social security system, government officials have said publicly in recent weeks. Widespread strikes are also expected in Greece Wednesday over austerity measures the government plans to implement to cut its large public debt, which has caused stock market jitters and concerns that sovereign debt problems will spill across the world.

495,"New York (CNN) -- Forget two turntables and a microphone -- New York City experienced two tornados  and a microburst Thursday, according to the National Weather  Service. Spokesman Gary Conte told reporters at the Office of Emergency Management late Friday.that an EF-0 tornado touched down in Brooklyn and an EF-1  tornado touched down in Queens. ""EF"" numbers -- the Enhanced Fujita scale -- are a method of estimating wind speed based on damage. An EF-0 tornado likely brought 3-second bursts of winds between 65 and 85 mph, while an EF-1 carried gusts of 86 to 110 mph. The strongest winds and  greatest damage, which also took place in Queens, were caused by what Conte  described as a ""microburst."" Conte said this was ""a sudden acceleration of winds  coming out from fast moving storms.""  It produced wind gusts up to 125 miles per  hour, he told reporters. National Weather Service meteorologist Ross Dickman told reporters that the service and emergency management and spent  the day reviewing radar data, interviewing residents, touring the ground and  flying around different parts of the city to determine the types of storms  that hit the area Thursday. ""I want to first say  that I'm very sorry for those that experienced extensive damage with this  storm,"" he said. Crews in New York worked  early Friday morning to clean up damage left behind by a  fast-moving storm that killed one person when it ripped through the city. The storm's strong winds and  torrential rains toppled trees and left more than 20,000 customers without power  Thursday. A 30-year-old woman was killed  in Queens when a tree fell on the car she was driving, the New York Police  Department said. ""The good news is that most  people were safe, just annoyed, traffic being bad or a tree coming down in their  yard,"" he said. Both New York City's La  Guardia and New Jersey's Newark airports experienced two-hour outbound delays  Thursday, while John F. Kennedy airport reported three-hour outbound delays. The storm also caused a  headache for commuters on Thursday.  All Long Island Railroad service going east  out of Manhattan was suspended Thursday after the storm,  as was service on certain subway lines running from Manhattan into Queens and Brooklyn.  .

496,"Paris, France (CNN) -- A strike by air-traffic controllers affected flights Wednesday across France, resulting in cancellations of 10 percent of scheduled flights from Paris' main international airport, the civil aviation authority DGAC said. In addition to the cancellations at Roissy Charles de Gaulle Airport, half of the flights from Orly, the nation's second-largest airport, were canceled, the authority said. Would-be passengers were urged to contact their airlines prior to traveling to the airport. Ireland's low-cost airline Ryanair called Wednesday for the French government to get the French military, ""if necessary,"" to take over air traffic control duties while civilian air traffic controllers are on strike. ""France, passengers and airlines cannot afford these airport closures at a time when traffic and tourism is suffering,"" Ryanair said in a statement. The timing coincides with the beginning of summer vacations for many French. One EasyJet passenger who was at Orly when she found out her flight had been canceled until Thursday bemoaned her situation.  ""In the middle of July, it's tough to find a place to stay,"" said Nawel Boubouka. The strike started Tuesday evening and is scheduled to end Thursday at 6 a.m. Controllers are striking over plans to unify European air traffic control. France is due to join Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to form what is being called Functional Airspace Block Europe Central (FABEC). FABEC is a cornerstone of the Single European Sky project, which advocates say will reduce fuel use and flight times by making it possible for planes to fly more direct routes across the continent. The FABEC area covers 1,713,442 square km (661,560 sq miles) and is characterized by closely interlaced civil and military traffic routes, its website says.

497,"(Health.com) -- Cleanup workers exposed to spilled oil may be at long-term risk for breathing trouble and other health problems, according to a new study examining the aftereffects of a 2002 oil spill in Spain. However, it's not clear whether the respiratory problems reported by the workers in the study are likely to crop up in the more than 50,000 people who have helped clean up the spill in the Gulf of Mexico caused by the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. ""We can't assume it's going to be the same here as it was there,"" says David Savitz, Ph.D., a professor of community health and ob-gyn at the Brown University School of Medicine, in Providence, R.I. ""But this shows that there is the potential for health effects that go well beyond the immediate period of exposure, and it reinforces what we've known before -- that respiratory health effects are high on that list,"" adds Savitz, co-author of an editorial accompanying the study. Health.com: Can't stop coughing? 8 possible reasons . The study, which appears in the Annals of Internal Medicine, included 501 fishermen who helped clean up spilled oil after the tanker Prestige sank off the coast of Spain in November 2002. The researchers compared the workers with a similar group of 176 fishermen who did not participate in the cleanup efforts. Two years after the accident, the fishermen who were exposed to oil were more likely to report wheezing, chronic cough, and other respiratory symptoms compared with those in the control group. The breath of the exposed fishermen also contained higher levels of chemicals associated with lung damage. (Smokers were excluded from these tests.) In addition, the researchers found higher rates of chromosome changes in the white blood cells of the exposed fishermen -- changes that have been linked to an increased risk of cancer in other studies, says Gina Solomon, M.D., a senior scientist with the National Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental group. Health.com: 7 surprising triggers of lung trouble . ""Given these chromosomal abnormalities, I'd also worry about effects on sperm and egg cells,"" says Solomon, who was not involved in the study. The study results ""indicate that participation in the cleanup of oil spills can have undesirable effects on health,"" says the lead researcher, Joan Albert Barberà, M.D., but he stresses that the cleanup workers in the study weren't sick. ""No evidence was found of any active illness, only biological alterations that might predispose to develop disease,"" says Barberà, a professor at the August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), in Barcelona. The findings suggest that doctors and health officials in the U.S. should be on the lookout for respiratory problems in workers who were exposed to the huge amounts of oil that gushed from the recently capped leak in the Gulf of Mexico. Health.com: Breathing tips for people with COPD . But the two spills aren't necessarily comparable, experts say. For starters, the Prestige spill -- which was roughly one-tenth the size of the Deepwater Horizon spill -- involved bunker oil, which contains different proportions of carcinogenic compounds (notably polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene) than the crude oil spilled in the Gulf, according to Solomon. Moreover, the oil from the Prestige was spilled on the surface and therefore may have had a different makeup from the oil from the Deepwater Horizon well, which ascended through almost a mile of water before it could make human contact, says Arch ""Chip"" Carson, M.D., a professor of occupational and environmental health at the University of Texas at Houston School of Public Health. The oil that cleanup workers in the Gulf will encounter is ""reasonably friendly bad stuff,"" Carson says. ""The likelihood of respiratory problems for these workers is negligible."" Oil isn't the only hazard, Carson points out. The dispersants used in both cleanup efforts could potentially cause respiratory effects as well. Health.com: Gulf oil spill still a health threat to many . The U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences recently announced the launch of a long-term study, known as the Gulf Worker Study, to investigate potential health problems stemming from the Deepwater Horizon spill. Although the Prestige spill may not be a perfect comparison, it still highlights the need to safeguard cleanup workers in the U.S., Solomon says. ""Gulf workers need to have adequate training and protective equipment, as well as access to health care and evaluations,"" she says. ""And they are going to need careful follow-up for years to come to make sure that if they do develop health problems, they are recognized and addressed.""

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: This Tuesday, March 9th, CNN Student News is going global; we have a lot of headlines to tell you about from around the world. Our first story today takes us to Turkey. First Up: Turkey Earthquake . AZUZ: Some residents there are dealing with the effects of an earthquake that killed more than 50 people. More than 70 others were injured by the quake. It struck early Monday morning. It had a magnitude of 5.9, so not as powerful as some of the tremors recently we've seen from Haiti and from Chile, but like those earthquakes, this one was followed by dozens of aftershocks. It happened in the southeastern part of Turkey. The Middle Eastern country, it's a little bit bigger than the U.S. state of Texas. It's located between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The quake hit in Turkey's Elazig province. It's located in a mountain region. In some of the cities there, many homes are made out of mud, instead of concrete. Turkish authorities say most of those were destroyed, although other buildings, like schools, are still standing. Relief efforts are already getting going. One official said residents ""are sad, but they are calm."" He added that the country is meeting the victims' needs. Just to give you some background, Turkey was established as a country in 1923 from part of what remained of the Ottoman Empire. It's home to about 77 million people. It's also no stranger to powerful earthquakes. In 1999, two quakes hit near Istanbul, Turkey's largest city. Those killed at least 20,000 people. Monday's tremor hit near the point where two major fault lines meet. It's an area that some scientists describe as unstable. Is this Legit? MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Pakistan is east of Afghanistan. Legit! The two countries share a border that's more than 1,500 miles long. Pakistan Bombing . AZUZ: The Taliban, a militant, Islamic group you've heard a lot about lately has caused violence in both of those countries, and it says it's responsible for this suicide bombing in Pakistan. The attack happened in Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city. It's located on the opposite side of the country from Afghanistan. The blast targeted a law enforcement agency. It killed at least a dozen people, injured more than a hundred others. Many of those victims were being treated at nearby hospitals. A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said the attack was a response to what he called U.S. aggression against Muslims around the world. A Pakistani official says the Taliban is trying to destabilize the country. But the government, he says, will not let them succeed. Afghan Offensive . AZUZ: Hopping back over that border to Afghanistan, where U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates made an unscheduled visit yesterday. Secretary Gates said part of the reason he was there was to get an update on Operation Moshtarak. We've told you a lot about that in recent weeks. Moshtarak is a military offensive against the Taliban; it's focused on the city of Marjah. Gates arrived in the capital city of Kabul on Monday. He was scheduled to meet with Afghan president Hamid Karzai as well as General Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. During the visit, the defense secretary said Marjah is just part of the fight. U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES: Of course, the operation in Marjah is only one of many battles to come in a much longer campaign focused on protecting the people of Afghanistan. AZUZ: The day before Secretary Gates arrived in Afghanistan, President Karzai, along with General McChrystal, went to Marjah to talk to the people there about the fight against the Taliban. Phil Black has more on that. (BEGIN VIDEO) PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: President Hamid Karzai traveled to Marjah to tell its population the Taliban would not be coming back. Hundreds filled a mosque to hear him speak and to tell him what they thought. They didn't hold back. They demanded schools, roads, hospitals and an honest police force. The president promised to rebuild their town. HAMID KARZAI, AFGHANISTAN PRESIDENT: I heard them. They heard me. They had some very legitimate complaints. Very, very legitimate. They felt as if they were abandoned which, in many cases, is true. GEN. STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, COMMANDER, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE: What I heard today is frustrations with things that people are going to be frustrated with war. But there's always frustration with the costs of war and how we operate. BLACK: General McChrystal's strategy is at work here: push the Taliban out, then stay and hold the ground while local government, police and services are established. But the population is skeptical. The Taliban have been cleared out before and allowed to return. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What is this activity better known as? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it called: A) Clogging, B) Krumping, C) Popping or D) Stepping? You've got three seconds -- GO! What you just saw was an example of stepping! That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Stepping Controversy . AZUZ: Stepping's been part of African-American culture for decades, especially on college campuses. Around 16 years ago, one sorority at a university in Arkansas taught the members of another sorority how to step. But when that second sorority took the title at a national competition last month, it stepped into the middle of controversy. Don Lemon explains why and what happened afterward. (BEGIN VIDEO) DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: This is stepping, a proud mix of tribal dance infusing military drills and popular culture. Dominated by African American fraternities and sororities for decades, until the ladies of Arkansas's Zeta Tau Alpha, an all-white team, stepped into a national competition and nailed it. RYAN CAMERON, EMCEE, RADIO PERSONALITY: Who do you all think it is? That's right. It is the Zetas. Zetas, Zetas, Zetas, first place. LEMON: Their win stunned the crowd of nearly 5,000 people. The emcee told the audience, don't be so surprised. CAMERON: I saw you. I saw you. You're like... Stepping is for everybody. If you can step, you can step. LEMON: Then came YouTube and worldwide reaction. Some said it was cultural theft: ""I wish you white people would stop stealing everything from us. Can we just have one thing for ourselves?"" ""Stepping is for us, not them."" Others saw it differently, writing ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."" ""Black, white, green, purple, who cares? This is good stuff by young people who have worked hard."" Deandre Clark, a former stepper, was at the show and understands why people are so passionate. DEANDRE CLARK, GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY, AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE INITIATIVE MENTORING PROGRAM: A lot of people might feel as though someone who didn't, does not have this background, how could they truly understand what it means to be out there stepping? At the same time, it could, on the other hand, it can make you happy to see that stepping is starting to go further than just African-Americans. LEMON: Now adding to the intrigue, nearly a week after the competition, organizers said there was a scoring discrepancy. So, first place that originally went to the Zetas, will now be shared with the Alpha Kappa Alphas from Indiana University. They share the title, but not the money. They both get $100,000 in scholarships. Don Lemon, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEO) Blog Promo . AZUZ: This is the kind of story we love to hear your opinions on. We want you to head to our Web page, CNNStudentNews.com. Scroll down. Click on our blog, From A to Z, to share your thoughts. Should stepping be exclusive? Should everyone be able to take part? We want to know what you think. And remember, we only want to see your first names on our blog. Legos for Haiti . AZUZ: In Pella, Iowa, dozens of young people are involved in a contest that's all about building something out of Legos. Every participant has to pay an entry fee, but the winners don't get any money for a very good reason. TITUS HOPKINS, LEGO CONTEST ORGANIZER: We were trying to find a way to raise money for Haiti. AZUZ: And so far they've raised more than $1,700! The little guy you saw there, Titus Hopkins, he's the one who came up with the idea for a Lego contest. And it's inspiring similar events in California and New York, the money going to help feed young Haitians. Before We Go . AZUZ: All right, we never like to leave you without something kind of off the wall, so before we go today, our last story: We want you to brace yourselves, 'cause this is gonna get ugly. That is what Rascal does best. The rough-looking rover won this ugly dog contest in California. But it's not all about repelling pooches. There were prizes for best costume. We assume he battered the competition. And if this guy didn't take home the title for coolest canine, we're gonna ask for a recount. Of course, all of this is for a good cause; it's to raise money for local animal charities. Goodbye . AZUZ: ...because, I mean, we gotta face it, it's a dog-eat-dog world out there. Doggone it, we're out of time. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz. We will look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

499,"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- The 33 miners trapped inside a Chilean mine since August 5 have been told for the first time that they could be stuck underground for as long as four months, the head of the rescue operation said Friday. But Andre Sougarret, the mines manager for the state mining company, and Chilean government representative Jimena Matos also said they are working on a ""Plan B,"" which could help speed up the rescue process. ""Last night, a third probe reached where the miners are and that probe, or the bore hole made by that probe, could form the basis of our plan B,"" said Sougarret, declining to offer specifics. Officials expect drilling on a rescue shaft, a process that workers have said could take four months to complete, to begin this weekend. Still, even under the best-case scenario, the trapped miners will be underground for quite some time -- posing a host of practical and psychological problems. To help solve them, Chilean officials are looking in unlikely places. An official at NASA, the U.S. space agency, said on Friday the organization has been asked by Chile to help provide nutritional and behavioral health support to the miners. A four-person team, including two physicians and a psychologist, are planning to go to Chile next week, said Michael Duncan, NASA's lead on the Chile effort. NASA has a long history in dealing with isolated environments and thinks experiences in space and underground are not too different, he said. ""It's an opportunity to us to bring the space-flight experience back down to the ground,"" said Duncan. The workers, trapped 2,300 feet below the surface, have been trying to keep their spirits -- and the spirits of their loved ones -- from flagging. They sent a video message to their families Thursday in which they expressed thanks for the efforts under way to free them and displayed occasional flashes of humor and patriotism. ""We know what you've all been doing for us,"" said one man. ""You haven't left us alone. We want to send applause to you."" At that, the men broke into applause. Throughout the 25-minute, high-definition video, one miner guided the hand-held camera ahead of him, its path illuminated by the light on his mining helmet. The video views were grainy and sometimes out of focus. The video showed the 50-square-meter (about 540-square-foot) living space occupied by the men since they were trapped by the collapse of a mine shaft. Some appeared heavily bearded, all of them were stripped to the waist. A thermometer showed 29.5 degrees Celsius, (about 85 degrees Fahrenheit), a little cooler than officials had estimated. Some of the men were standing, others were lying down. ""Oh, you're sleeping on a box-spring bed,"" joked one man to another, who is sprawled out on a pile of rocks. On a crate sat a set of dominoes; on a wall were two first-aid boxes. Nearby were two stretchers. One miner said to his family: ""Be calm. We're going to get out of here. And we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your efforts."" At that, the other miners broke into applause again. The tenor of most of the comments was calm, though one man's emotion cut through. ""Thank you to everybody,"" he said. ""I send you a big hug in the name of our Lord."" As he spoke, his voice cracked. Out of the view of the camera, as one miner finished his message, another could be heard saying, ""Get us out of here soon."" Family members who saw the video in a private screening said their loved ones appeared thin, but healthy and in good spirits. Several said many of the relatives cried as they watched and listened. Doctors have given the miners advice about how to keep their limited living space clean: Portions of a 1-meter-high (3.3 feet), 40-meter-long (about 130 feet) shaft are being used as a latrine. It is connected to the main cabin, which is being used for sleeping, washing and praying. The men's sole lifeline to the outside world is a tube approximately 8 centimeters (3.2 inches) in diameter, through which food, water, clothing, video and radio equipment and whatever else is needed are stuffed. Health Minister Jaime Manalich told reporters Thursday that, on average, each man has lost 22 pounds (10 kilograms) since they became trapped three weeks ago, and dehydration remains a threat. But a survey of the men indicates that at least nine miners are still too overweight to fit through the proposed rescue shaft, he said. Three or four of the miners are showing signs of anxiety and depression, Manalich added.","NASA to provide nutritional and behavioral health support .

500,"Biejing, China (CNN) -- Floods have killed at least 29 people in northeastern China this week and washed tons of chemical containers into the Songhua River, state media reported Friday. The death toll from the flood waters in Jilin province rose to 27 in Yongji county.  Two more people died in neighboring Shuangyang city, according to a statement from Jilin's civil affairs department,  Xinhua news agency reported. The flooding has forced more than 254,000 people from their homes and collapsed about 22,000 buildings, civil affairs said. On Wednesday, the rising water hit a chemical plant in Jilin and 7,000 containers washed into the Songhua River --  3,000 of which were filled with explosive chemicals,  Xinhua said. Emergency teams were mobilized to recover the spilled fluid. Authorities had recovered 1,500 containers by Thursday evening. Jilin is the latest province to be hit by fatal floods that have left 928 people dead and 477 missing nationwide, according to China's flood control and drought relief headquarters.","The floods in Jilin province kill 29 people .

501,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Attacks in Pakistan on trucks carrying fuel for NATO troops in Afghanistan damaged about two dozen trucks and killed two people Friday, authorities said. Militants torched dozens of supply trucks in the southern Pakistani province of Sindh Friday morning, police said. No one was hurt, but 25 of 27 trucks were damaged, officials said. On Friday night, attackers with automatic weapons struck a NATO supply truck, killing two people and damaging contents, Pakistani police said. Saeed Ahmed, a senior police official in the Khuzdar district of Baluchistan, said the truck was apparently separated from a convoy heading to Afghanistan. The Friday morning attack took place in the Shikarpur district when four militants used fire crackers and petrol bombs to damage the trucks, said Muhammad Hanif, a senior police official in the district. The trucks carry crude, diesel and petrol for NATO troops in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, NATO convoys were still barred Friday from going into Afghanistan through the Torkham Gate checkpoint. The supply route to Afghanistan has been closed by the Pakistani government after fighting that led to the deaths of three Pakistani soldiers, and a military spokesman said Thursday that United States is hopeful the situation is only temporary. Pakistan banned NATO supply convoys from entering Afghanistan after the deaths of the three soldiers, whom the government says were killed in Pakistani territory during fighting between NATO troops and militants, according to a military official from the NATO-led command in Afghanistan. Lt. Col. John Dorrian, an ISAF spokesman, said the Torkham Gate in the Khyber Agency has been closed since about midday on Thursday. Chaman Gate, the other border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan, remains open. ""We don't think it's a very serious problem,"" Dorrian said. ""It's a throroughfare we use a lot so it is significant. But we can work around it."" ""We do expect these matters to be resolved."" Supply convoys are all-important for the Afghan war effort, and officials from NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) were trying to persuade Pakistan to lift the ban. Coalition forces rely heavily on convoys from Pakistan to bring in supplies and gear. Torkham Gate is one of the main ports of entry for material coming into the war zone. But it is not the only way of getting supplies in. Khyber Agency is one of the seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region. About half the cargo that flows into Afghanistan comes in via one of the two gates from Pakistan, the Defense Department says. Another 30 percent uses two major routes through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, one via Russia and the other via the Caucasus. The remaining 20 percent -- mostly sensitive items like weapons, ammunition and other critical equipment -- comes in by air.

502,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia man suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease says he wants to die by having his organs harvested rather than wait for his degenerative nerve ailment to kill him. Garry Phebus has been battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as the disease is formally known, since 2008. The 61-year-old told HLN's ""Prime News"" on Thursday that the diagnosis is ""a death sentence, positively, no questions asked,"" and he wants do donate his organs while he still can. ""If people have their legs cut off or their wife left them and they commit suicide, it's another story. They still have a life ahead of them. But I do not,"" he said. And for people waiting for transplants, ""There's nothing greater than for a family member to receive an organ so they can watch their family grow up."" Lou Gehrig's disease attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, affecting voluntary muscle control. In its later stages, the disease can leave sufferers paralyzed but fully conscious and alert. Phebus lives in White, Georgia, about 50 miles north of Atlanta. He conceded his decision is ""not for everyone,"" but said his family supports him -- a statement backed up with some qualifications by his daughter, Kerri Wilkinson. ""We kind of said, 'OK, well, let's not do this at this very second,' but to find out more about it,"" Wilkinson said. But she said that when her father's disease ""gets to the point where he's lost his pride or become humiliated in how he's having to suffer and the indignities ... we're not going to have an issue with that."" About 5,600 Americans a year are diagnosed with the disease, according to the ALS Association, a nonprofit group that advocates for more research on the disease. Those diagnosed typically live two to five years. But some, like famed Cambridge University physicist Stephen Hawking, survive for decades. Phebus' offer is ""admirable, and our heart goes out to him,"" Leigh Vinocur, an emergency medicine physician at the University of Maryland, told HLN. ""But 10 percent of people can live 20 years with this disease."" Vinocur said what Phebus wants to do amounts to physician-assisted suicide, a practice legal in only three U.S. states -- Oregon, Washington and Montana. And in those states, patients who seek to end their lives are typically in the last stages of a terminal disease. ""We donate organs in patients that, say, are brain dead or have terminal events,"" she said. Most doctors ""would have a problem"" with what Phebus wants to do, because ""at this point, he's fairly healthy."" ""I can't picture any states essentially putting, right now, a relatively healthy man under anesthesia, taking out vital organs like his heart and taking him off the ventilator,"" Vinocur said. And ALS is unlikely to harm the organs most likely to be used for transplants unless some sort of related infection strikes them, she said. Phebus has also taken his appeal online. In a video posted on the website YouTube, he argues that 90,000 people a year die waiting for organ transplants, and compares his situation to a soldier in a foxhole throwing himself on a grenade to save his comrades. ""I am not suicidal,"" he says. ""I just know that it is a matter of time before I die and wish to do a good thing for those people who have a good life expectancy""","Garry Phebus says he's under a ""death sentence""
