1511,"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Pilot error caused the crash of a U.N. helicopter in March which killed 10 people, a Nepalese investigating official said Wednesday. A U.N. worker at the site of the March helicopter crash that killed 10 people in Nepal. The helicopter was traveling from a camp for former Maoist rebels in eastern Nepal to the capital, Kathmandu, when it crashed on March 3. The crew did not consult the weather forecast, nor did it plan a route before taking off, said Nagendra Prasad Ghimire, the joint secretary of the civil aviation ministry and part of the investigation commission. Once the helicopter encountered bad weather, the pilot's unfamiliarity of local terrain compounded the problem, Ghimire said, summarizing the commission's findings. ""He thought that, 'If I climb into the clouds, I will be safe above the terrain and continue to Kathmandu,'"" he said. Instead, the crew found itself unable to control the aircraft. But the pilot kept the helicopter on auto-pilot mode. ""The pilot should have manually handled the aircraft to rotate safely to the ground,"" Ghimire said. ""Unfortunately, he didn't."" The chopper crashed in a mountainous region near Bhawasa, about 145 km (90 miles) east of Kathmandu. The U.N. mission said three victims were Nepalese citizens. The others included four international arms monitors from Gambia, Indonesia, South Korea and Sweden. The air crew, from a Russian company, comprised of two Russians and one Belarussian, the U.N. mission said. The helicopter was returning from inspecting a camp for former Maoist rebels who fought a 10-year civil war to end Nepal's monarchy. More than 13,0000 people died in the fighting. The rebels signed a peace deal with the government in 2006, joined mainstream politics and won the most seats in April's election for the Constituent Assembly. The victory transformed Nepal from a monarchy to a republic after 239 years of autocratic rule.","Pilot error caused U.N. helicopter crash killing 10 people, probe finds .

1512,"Washington (CNN) -- Prescription drug overdose is now the fastest-growing drug problem in the country, surpassing the number of people who overdosed during both the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and the black tar heroin epidemic of the 1970s combined, the Obama administration says. The problem is so severe, the administration is releasing a plan to combat what it calls a crisis of epidemic proportions. ""The toll our nation's prescription drug abuse epidemic has taken in communities nationwide is devastating,"" said Gil Kerlikowske, White House director of national drug control policy. ""We share a responsibility to protect our communities from the damage done by prescription drug abuse."" According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in 2007 about 28,000 people died from drug overdoses. Most were accidental and were related to prescription drugs. ""Today, we are making an unprecedented commitment to combat the growing problem of prescription drug abuse,"" said Vice President Joe Biden as he announced the administration's plan Tuesday morning. ""The government, as well as parents, patients, health care providers, and manufacturers all play a role in preventing abuse. This plan will save lives, and it will substantially lessen the burden this epidemic takes on our families, communities, and workforce."" The effort, called ""Epidemic: Responding to America's Prescription Drug Abuse Crisis,"" is primarily aimed at cracking down on abuse of opioids, some of the most powerful pain relievers on the market. Opioids are a class of drugs used to treat chronic pain and include products like OxyContin, Vicodin, Darvon, Dilaudid and Demerol. When abused they can be highly addictive. Prescriptions for these painkillers have increased dramatically over the past 10 years. In 2000 pharmacies filed 174 million opioid prescriptions. By 2009 that number was 257 million. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, over the past five years, hospital emergency room visits linked to prescription drug abuse or misuse have doubled. ""Unintentional drug overdose is a growing epidemic in the U.S. and is now the leading cause of injury death in 17 states,"" said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""There are effective and emerging strategies out there to address this problem. Support for this action plan will help us implement those strategies which will go a long way to save lives and reduce the tremendous burden this problem has on our health care system and our society."" The plan seeks to reduce abuse and drug diversion, educate both parents and health care providers, find better ways to dispose of unused pills, and beef up enforcement efforts by clamping down on pill mills and doctor shopping. The Food and Drug Administration will provide support by requiring an opioids Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to determine that a drug's benefits outweigh its risks. Under this process, drug manufacturers must make educational materials on proper prescribing and disposal available to anyone writing prescriptions for long-acting and extended-release painkillers. The agency must approve all materials before they are released. ""Long-acting and extended-release opioid drugs have benefit when used properly and are a necessary component of pain management for certain patients, but we know that they pose serious risks when used improperly, with serious negative consequences for individuals, families and communities,"" said FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg. ""The prescriber education component of this opioid (risk evaluation and mitigation strategy) balances the need for continued access to these medications with stronger measures to reduce their risks."" Thirty-five states already have prescription drug monitoring programs in place that help track how prescriptions are prescribed and distributed by authorized healthcare providers and pharmacies. The program's main goal is to prevent abuse and diversion at the retail level. Under the new plan, agencies will work to establish prescription drug monitoring programs in every state. The Drug Enforcement Agency will be heavily involved in enforcement, recovering prescription drugs, and focusing on doctors who illegally prescribe and dispense these drugs. They will also target ""doctor shoppers"" -- people who visit multiple doctors to secure multiple prescriptions and pill mills. ""When abused, prescription drugs are just as dangerous and just as addictive as drugs like methamphetamine or heroin,"" DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said. ""The more we can do to stop the abuse of prescription drugs, the more effective we will be in reducing the death, destruction and despair that accompanies all drug abuse."" A number of other federal agencies will also be involved in the effort, including the departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, Defense and Veterans Affairs.","Abuse of prescription drugs is reaching epidemic proportions, the administration says .

1513,"Washington (CNN) -- Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced Monday that the Obama administration will push legislation designed to overhaul and upgrade America's aging oil and gas pipeline network. The initative is partly a response to a series of deadly pipeline explosions, including one last year in San Bruno, California, that killed eight people and destroyed 37 homes. A February pipeline explosion in Allentown, Pennsylvania, resulted in the deaths of five people. San Bruno's faulty pipeline was installed in 1956; Allentown's was installed in 1928. During a news conference in Allentown, LaHood called on the major pipeline companies to conduct a review of their oil and gas delivery systems to identify the lines with the highest risk. He also urged them to speed up the most critical repair work. ""People deserve to know that they can turn on the lights, the heat or the stove without endangering their families and neighbors,"" LaHood said. ""The safety of the American public is my top priority, and I am taking on this critical issue to avoid future tragedies we have seen in Allentown and around the country."" Among other things, the administration wants to increase the maximum civil penalties for pipeline violations from $100,000 per day to $250,000 per day. It also wants to increase fines from $1 million to $2.5 million for a series of violations. The administration also would like to boost the number of safety inspectors and improve data reporting to increase the likelihood of early identification of possible pipeline safety risks. The Transportation Department is planning to convene a pipeline safety forum on April 18 in Washington. The United States has more than 2.5 million miles of pipelines used for the delivery of oil and gas, according to the Transporation Department. CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Transporation Secretary Ray LaHood presses pipeline firms to upgrade aging delivery systems .

1514,"Mexico City (CNN) -- The helicopter crash in Mexico that killed Interior Minister Jose Francisco Blake Mora and all seven other people aboard shows no evidence of an explosion, a Mexican official said Saturday. ""In visual and preliminary investigations of the crash site, the remains of the aircraft do not show evidence of any kind of damage from an explosion or fire,"" said Dionisio Perez-Jacome, minister of communication and transportation. ""It is worth mentioning that according to the available information up until this moment, present at the place and time of the incident were layers of clouds and reduced visibility,"" Perez-Jacome said. His announcement on government television came as Mexico began a day of grieving for the eight killed Friday in the helicopter crash in a rural area just south of Mexico City. Mexican President Felipe Calderon and his wife were among the government officials at a public funeral in Mexico City on Saturday afternoon. The eight caskets were each draped with the Mexican flag on the vast green grounds of Campo Militar Marte where Calderon led a tearful ceremony of handing portraits of the eight helicopter victims to their respective families and children. A military band played sorrowful dirges, as did a drum and bugle corps at other points in the funeral. ""Here, in the earth, their example and memory will endure forever,"" Calderon told the black-attired mourners in the galleries and grandstand, all on their feet during the ceremony. ""These are difficult times for the government and for the nation, but it is also a time to show the strength to overcome these adversities,"" Calderon said. The Friday incident -- which occurred 2.5 miles south of the town of Santa Catarina Atoyzingo in the municipality of Chalco -- evoked comparisons to a 2008 plane crash that also killed the country's then-interior minister. That crash, in a luxurious Mexico City neighborhood, was later determined to be an accident caused by turbulence. The Learjet carrying the minister and others was following a commercial airliner too closely, authorities said. Calderon on Friday called Blake Mora ""a great Mexican who deeply loved his country and served until the last moment of his life."" Analysts said that the crash puts renewed attention on the president's controversial efforts to fight the nation's notorious cartels because the interior minister oversees domestic security. ""The national mood is such that even before this, people are alarmed"" about cartel violence, said Stephen Zamora, professor at the University of Houston Law Center who's an expert on Mexican law and U.S.-Mexico relations. ""Calderon is in the last year of his presidency, so Mexico is entering a presidential election year just as the United States is. President Calderon has been criticized because the number of persons killed has escalated during his presidency and so people see him as failed. I think that's a harsh judgment,"" Zamora said. ""He inherited a country, especially in the northern states, that is being destabilized by the drug cartels. He's started employing the army, which hasn't been used much domestically, to fight the drug cartels,"" Zamora said. While Blake Mora was well regarded by U.S. officials, his loss won't devastate the Calderon administration, said Pamela K. Starr, associate professor of international relations at the University of Southern California. ""I think there's an inevitability that there will be speculation that organized crime was involved in this, but it seems highly unlikely to me that indeed will be the case,"" Starr said, noting how the helicopter crashed under foggy conditions in a remote area. ""He was very highly thought of both within Mexico and with his counterparts in the United States,"" Starr said of Blake Mora. ""With that said, he has not been one of the central figures in the battle against drug cartels in Mexico. The lead has been taken more by the federal police and the president himself, along with the military and the prosecutor's office."" The helicopter went down in the Xochimilco area south of Mexico City, government spokeswoman Alejandra Sota said. Two other government officials were killed in the crash: Undersecretary for Legal Affairs and Human Rights Felipe Zamora and the ministry's press office chief, Jose Alfredo Garcia, she said. In July 2010, Calderon appointed Blake Mora to the post that oversees security efforts against drug cartels in Mexico. That battle has cost thousands of lives. ""I grieve his loss"" and those of the other victims, Calderon said in a national address on Friday, adding that Blake Mora, who was 45, leaves behind a wife and two children. Authorities will continue to investigate the cause of the accident. A photograph of the crash site depicts a relatively concentrated debris field. The French-manufactured Super Puma THP06 helicopter was made in 1987 and had logged 717 hours of flight, Mexican officials said. The helicopter crashed while traveling between Mexico City and the Mexican state of Morelos south of the city, officials said. The others killed were Diana Miriam Hayton Sanchez, the technical secretary of the minister's office; Maj. Rene de Leon Sapien of the Presidential Guard, who was Blake Mora's personal security detail; and three members of the air force: pilot Lt. Col. Felipe Bacio Cortes, Lt. Pedro Ramon Escobar and Sgt. Jorge Luis Juarez Gomez. Before becoming interior minister, Blake Mora was an attorney from Baja California state who was chief of staff to the state government from 2007 until July 2010. Previously, he was a councilman in Tijuana, as well as a state and federal congressman. Blake Mora was considered to be politically close to the president and, in fact, led his political campaign in Baja California. Ironically, Blake Mora's last writing in his Twitter account refers to the November 2008 accident that killed a prior interior minister. ""Today we remember Juan Camilo Mourino three years after his departure, a human being who worked on building a better Mexico,"" Blake Mora wrote in a tweet posted November 4, the third anniversary of the accident.

1515,"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Weeks ago, Dan Wheldon was behind the wheel of a new prototype car for the IZOD IndyCar racing series -- one meant to make his sport safer, albeit ideally no less exciting. The two-time Indianapolis 500 winner, who'd been one of a handful of key collaborators in the safety effort as identified on the racing circuit's website, never got a chance to see the refined engines at work in a real race. Instead on Monday, his friends, colleagues and the racing world were mourning his death following a fiery 15-car wreck at the Las Vegas Indy 300. ""I lost one of my best friends, one of my greatest teammates,"" driver Tony Kanaan told reporters hours after Sunday's fatal crash. ""I know this is a dangerous sport. I know we're exposed to that every day, in normal life as well,"" he added. ""But you know, you don't think about it. Today, we have to think about it."" Images from the fatal crash . Had he won Sunday's race, the Englishman with the ready smile and engaging manner would have earned a $5 million payout. Instead, he was near the back of the 34-car field when he got mixed up in a crash that featured numerous cars spinning out of control and bursting into flames, spewing smoke and debris. ""All I could see was fire and parts flying and smoke,"" recalled Paul Tracy, one of those involved in the crash, on Monday. ""When it all came to a stop, it looked like something out of a movie set ... It didn't seem real."" An official at the Clark County Coroner's Office, who was not named per the office's policy, told CNN on Monday that Wheldon officially died from ""blunt head trauma."" The 33-year-old's death has been ruled an ""accident."" Two other drivers seriously injured in the wreck -- J.R. Hildebrand and Pippa Mann -- were released Monday from University Medical Center in Las Vegas, IndyCar said in a release. Mann had surgery Sunday night for a burn injury to a finger on her right hand, while Hildebrand was held overnight after suffering a severely bruised sternum. Championship contender Will Power was treated and released Sunday, IndyCar spokeswoman Amy Konrath said. The violent crash raised fresh questions about safety, both in motor sports generally and at the Las Vegas track specifically. Wheldon had been a driving force to address such concerns. In an early October story posted on IndyCar.com, the racing series' official website, IndyCar Vice President Will Phillips singled out the 33-year-old driver, his team and Italian manufacturer Dallara for their efforts to fine-tool a safer car model for the 2012 season. ""He's focused on what's been needed from him to provide for the feedback to Dallara and be consistent and concise,"" Phillips said then of Wheldon. ""You couldn't have asked for more."" Wheldon was known as ""a great family man"" Ironically, the new 2012 cars were expected to have components -- namely extra protection around tires -- to prevent spin-outs like the one that triggered Sunday's wreck when two vehicles' bump together, said Tracy. ""They want the cars to run a bit more in a pack, (but) these cars are not designed to bang wheels with each other at 225 mph,"" the veteran driver said. ""Our wheels (currently) are exposed. Once you have two cars touch each other, you don't have any control."" Wheldon's death was the first for the IndyCar circuit since March 2006, when driver Paul Dana was killed in a two-car crash while warming up for the season-opening race at Homestead-Miami Speedway. It is one of several in motor sports generally, one of the most famous being the elder Dale Earnhardt's death in NASCAR's 2001 Daytona 500. Sports Illustrated senior writer Jon Wertheim said Monday that the sheer speed of race cars, and the minimal distance separating them, means danger lurks around every turn and on every straightaway. Wheldon, for example, was bunched with several other vehicles cruising at about 220 miles an hour when Sunday's crash occurred. ""The fact of the matter is, you're dealing with very, very fast automobiles. They're not heavy cars,"" Wertheim said. ""There is, unfortunately, an assumption of risk when you get into one of those race cars."" Beyond questions about racing's safety generally, the condition of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway -- and whether or not it was too fast and too crammed with vehicles -- was the subject of intense questioning in the hours after Wheldon's death. Driver Dario Franchitti told ABC News that the track offered ""nowhere to get away from anybody."" ""This is not a suitable track, and we've seen it today,"" he said. The loop in Las Vegas is 1.5 miles, one mile shorter than that of the iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway. At the same time, it is wider than many others -- such that more cars can run alongside, and potentially collide with, one another. In an interview with CNN on Monday, former IndyCar driver Lyn St. James noted too that the slope of the track's curves and its straightaway can create ""this momentum and this ability for all the cars to be able to go flat out, (which) really takes the car out of the driver's hands."" Not going as far as Franchitti in critiquing the Las Vegas oval, St. James said that a number of factors -- including the vehicles' speed and numbers, as well as the track's configuration -- came together ""like the perfect storm."" ""It was unfortunate, it was tragic, it was something we all wish would never have happened,"" she said of Wheldon's death. Blog: Wheldon's death should bring changes in racetracks . That sentiment rang true for many in the racing community. After the crash at the IZOD IndyCar World Championships, many of the remaining drivers were emotional during and after a five-lap salute in Wheldon's honor. The rest of the marquee event was canceled. ""There are no words for today,"" driver Danica Patrick, the first woman to win an IndyCar race in 2008, tweeted. ""Myself and so many others are devastated. I pray for suzi (Wheldon's wife) and the kids that god will give them strength."" Wheldon, who was born in Emberton, England, lived in St. Petersburg, Florida. His father was a go-kart racer, and his mother was the timer at a local track. As a driver, Wheldon teamed up with the Alzheimer's Association to promote awareness of Alzheimer's disease; he was wearing the association's logo when he won the Indy 500 in May. His mother was diagnosed with the disease in 2009. In North Carolina, Sven Bhem told CNN affiliate WGHP that his son-in-law -- who, just hours before this weekend's race, had sung him ""Happy Birthday"" over the phone -- wasn't ""just a great driver, but he was a great human being,"" Bhem said. ""He was always positive, always had something good to say about everybody."" He said Wheldon and his daughter had been married four years and have two sons, ages 2 1/2 years and 7 months. In a statement released Monday, Wheldon's management company, GP Sports Management, described the driver as a ""champion on the track and a devoted family man off it."" ""Dan loved his fans and always took that extra bit of time to take a photo, to sign an autograph, to make some young kid smile at the racetrack. Everyone wanted to be around Dan. His passion and his enthusiasm for life was infectious."" St. James remembered Wheldon as a ""brash kid from England"" when he first began. ""We watched him mature into being this absolute, consummate professional,"" she said. ""... He touched so many people."" She said she believes Wheldon's death will ""kind of raise the bar"" in terms of safety for drivers. While a number of safety measures are in place, and the sport will always be high-risk, ""we don't want this kind of thing to happen,"" she said. Tracy concurred, telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he hopes ""out of this tragedy, comes some good in terms of improving safety,"" like putting see-through glass in place of web-like netting around tracks. The driver added that his wife and parents have implored him to retire in the wake of his friend's death. While he said he is considering it, Tracy also acknowledged that he and other racers aren't blind to the dangers. ""We're all thrill-seekers at heart, we all take risks on the race track,"" he said. ""This sport isn't for everybody. (Nonetheless), obviously, we'd like to see improvement.""

1516,"Washington (CNN) -- Apparently no good deed goes unpunished for President Barack Obama, who was trying to make sure he didn't get a flabby belly after Thanksgiving but wound up with a fat lower lip instead. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the president received a dozen stitches after getting hit with an errant elbow during a Friday morning basketball game with White House aide Reggie Love and others at the Fort McNair military base in Washington. The elbow belonged to Rey Decerega, who works for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. According to White House aides, Decerega went up for a shot and turned into the President, who was playing defense and accidentally got hit in the mouth. ""I learned today the president is both a tough competitor and a good sport,"" Decerega said in a statement released by the White House. ""I enjoyed playing basketball with him this morning. I'm sure he'll be back out on the court again soon."" According to Gibbs, ""After being inadvertently hit with an opposing player's elbow in the lip while playing basketball with friends and family, the president received 12 stitches today administered by the White House Medical Unit. They were done in the doctor's office located on the ground floor of the White House."" Aides said Obama was given a local anesthetic while receiving the stitches, and doctors used a smaller-than-usual filament. That increased the number of stitches needed to patch up the tear, but it made a tighter stitch so that the scar on the president's lower lip should be smaller. Obama frequently plays basketball, works out on a daily basis, and was undoubtedly playing Friday to work off some extra Thanksgiving calories. An official White House menu showed that in addition to turkey and the usual trimmings, the first family dined Thursday on six types of pie: apple, sweet potato, pumpkin, banana cream, cherry, and huckleberry. Asked by CNN if Decerega will be getting a presidential pardon, a top White House aide just laughed.","Obama gets 12 stitches after taking an elbow to the lip .

1517,"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptians reveled in their chance to vote in a post-Hosni Mubarak era during a second day of parliamentary elections, but nightfall brought new clashes in Cairo's Tahrir Square that stretched into Wednesday. At least 88 people had been hurt, 28 of them seriously enough to go to a hospital, a Health Ministry official, Dr. Adel Adawi, told the state-run newspaper Al-Ahram. The rest were treated at makeshift clinics in the square, Adawi said, but hospitals expected more people to be brought in. The victims had been hit by rocks, glass bottles, birdshot and Molotov cocktails, Dr. Hisham Sheeha, another Health Ministry official, told CNN. At least a dozen gunshots rang out across the plaza, and ambulances darted in and out of the square as the fighting continued. Tahrir Square was the epicenter of the protests that drove Mubarak from power in February and the ongoing demonstrations against the military council that succeeded him. The state-run Middle East News Agency, citing a military source, said there were no police or troops in the square at the time. Witnesses said Tuesday's melee began with fights between vendors and protesters, who began throwing rocks and attacking their kiosks with sticks. The protesters complained some vendors were giving demonstrations a bad image by selling marijuana, said Mina Hagras, one of the demonstrators who has been camped in the square. ""This is not the spirit of the revolutionaries or the square,"" Hagras said. ""They warned them. They did not stop. So they took matters in their own hands and beat them up. Now, state TV is saying all the protesters in (the) square are thugs and drug users. This is not fair."" But Mohamed Shafei, whose sandwich stand was destroyed in the brawl, said the protesters turned on the vendors indiscriminately and confiscating their goods. ""Yes, there were several vendors selling hashish and pills, but not all of us are the same,"" Shafei said as he carried the remains of his kiosk. ""Now the vendors are pissed and retaliating."" The new clashes came after a second day of voting, the first time some Egyptians -- young and old -- have ever cast ballots. Citizens are picking members of the lower house of parliament, which will be tasked with drafting a new constitution after three decades of Mubarak's rule. Despite logistical problems and illegal campaigning that marred the first day of balloting on Monday, Egypt's stock exchange opened considerably higher Tuesday and saw an unprecedented wave of buying amid the elections. Voters decried the late opening of polling stations Monday and a delay in the arrival of ballots, leading the head of Egypt's election committee to promise a smoother voting process Tuesday. Election officials said they have received 964 complaints, 579 of which have been addressed, according to Egypt TV. State TV reported that 25 people were injured in election-related violence. Activist Hafez Abu Saeeda, of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, said on Twitter he was in Al-Khaleefa ""working on an election tour, and an attack took place on our supporters before I arrived."" The army was able to control the situation immediately, he said. One person was injured. But many voters expressed jubilation at their chance to help build a new Egypt after the popular revolt that toppled Mubarak. ""Before, there was always cheating. Now -- I could be wrong -- but I think my vote will count,"" Mohamed Rida'a Mohamed Abdulla said as he left a Cairo polling station. Some polling areas were segregated by gender. Lines at both men's and women's stations snaked around buildings for hours. ""It's an awakening,"" one woman said, beaming, at a Cairo polling station. ""I'm very happy, and I feel that even when I see old ladies hardly walking, it makes me feel that really Egypt is reviving."" The stakes are high for Egyptian women, who worry that if Islamists gain a majority in the lower house of Parliament, their hopes for a more liberal life will be quashed. In Alexandria, the Al Noor Salafi Muslim party and the Freedom and Justice Party accused one another of breaking an ""honorable agreement"" aimed at cooperation. The Freedom and Justice Party is part of the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood, one of the nation's largest organizations. Yousri Hamad, a spokesman for the Al Noor Salafi party, said the Muslim Brotherhood spread false rumors and launched a ""smear campaign"" against the party. ""We were not as prepared for the elections as we should have been and did not spend enough money on the campaigning,"" Hamad said. But Essam Erian, spokesman for the Freedom and Justice Party, said the Salafis had breached the agreement by making such accusations without evidence. Ali Al Dali, an official monitor for the Egyptian Association of Human Rights, said eight cases of vote-buying had been documented in Alexandria, and police had been notified. About 45% of eligible voters in the city had cast ballots, he said. Elections for the lower house are scheduled to take place in three stages, based on geography. The last of the three stages is set to take place in January. Upper house elections will run between January and March. Presidential elections will be held by June, according to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt's acting ruling body. Military leaders have said they will hand over power to a new government when one is elected, but many Egyptians say they don't trust the council and fear the military will cling to power. Over the past two weeks, at least 42 people have been killed in clashes as protesters called for an immediate end to military rule. An additional 3,250 have been wounded, according to the Health Ministry. Some Egyptians expressed skepticism or even boycotted the voting on Monday. ""There is no inclination that the judiciary is independent, so there is no way to prove the election will be free and fair,"" said Amr Hamzawy, a 32-year-old shopkeeper. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Ivan Watson, Leone Lakhani and Jim Clancy and journalists Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Ian Lee contributed to this report.","NEW: Fresh Tahrir Square clashes leave nearly 90 wounded .

1518,"(CNN) -- A pair of earthquakes with magnitudes of at least 5.0 struck within 90 minutes of each other near Christchurch, New Zealand, on Monday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported, reviving vivid memories of a deadly quake that killed more than 180 people in February. ""Everyone is on edge here anyway,"" said Rhys Taylor, who said he could hear sirens and see helicopters flying over Christchurch. ""Obviously, power's out -- sort of all over the city at the moment -- and phone lines are down."" Police evacuated sections of the city's central business district after reports of a possible gas leak, police said. Several bridges in the city were closed as a precaution. ""It was quite an exciting ride,"" Christchurch Police Acting Inspector Murray Hurst told CNN after the first quake, adding that there was some damage caused by the quake and a few injuries that were not life-threatening. The first quake -- a magnitude 5.2 -- was centered 9 kilometers (5 miles) east-southeast of Christchurch at a depth of 11 kilometers (6.8 miles), according to USGS. The quake took place at 1 p.m. Monday. A second quake -- a more powerful 6.0 tremor -- struck at 2:20 p.m., roughly 13 kilometers (8 miles) north-northeast of the city at a depth of 9 kilometers (5.6 miles). And at least one smaller quake followed. A magnitude 4.6 quake struck at 2:40 p.m. about 11 kilometers (6 miles) east of Christchurch and at a depth of 12.5 kilometers (7.8 miles), according to the USGS. The quakes came nearly four months after a 6.3-magnitude temblor struck the same area, killing more than 180 people. CNN's Jack Maddox and Anisha Bhandari contributed to this report.","Three quakes strike near Christchurch within two hours .

1519,"(CNN) -- Natalie Wood was terrified of the water. As an 11-year-old shooting ""The Green Promise,"" she was thrown off a bridge during a storm scene and nearly drowned. The incident scarred her for life. Thirty-two years later, Wood died after falling into the ocean off Catalina Island in California. Wood's life is full of such curiosities. She was that rare child performer to make the transition to adult movie star, but her rise to success was marked by troubled relationships. She had beauty and talent, but she suffered from alcohol abuse and once tried to commit suicide. And then there's her death, coming just as she was restarting her movie career. Wood, who died in 1981, is back in the news after police reopened the case involving her drowning at age 43. Police: Robert Wagner not a suspect in new probe of Natalie Wood's death . The story surrounding Wood's death has long been one of Hollywood's great mysteries. She was making a motion picture comeback in a highly touted science-fiction film, ""Brainstorm,"" and was on her yacht with her husband, Robert Wagner, and her co-star, Christopher Walken. Aspects of Wood's life have only heightened the speculation. How could someone so young, with a good marriage and revitalized career, die just like that? Captain describes Wood cover-up story . Wood had been a top star for decades, both a box office draw and Oscar-nominated actress. Among her films were some of the biggest and most influential of the 1950s and '60s, including ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" ""West Side Story"" and ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice."" ""It was as if she had movie star stamped on her birth certificate,"" Wagner once said. Indeed, she seemed fated for stardom from the beginning. Wood was born Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko, daughter of Russian immigrants, in San Francisco in 1938. The family later changed their last name to Gurdin. At age 4, she had a bit part in 1943's ""Happy Land"" after a production company spotted her in nearby Santa Rosa. Her mother, intent on her daughter making it in the movie business, moved the family to Los Angeles, and young Natalia, renamed Natalie Wood by the studio, soon earned a role in the 1946 Orson Welles film ""Tomorrow Is Forever."" Welles was impressed with the scene-stealing youngster. ""She's terrifying!"" he's said to have described her. (Wood's sister, Lana, also did well, later playing Plenty O'Toole in the James Bond film ""Diamonds Are Forever."") From the late '40s until the mid-'50s, she was one of the most active child performers in the movie business, appearing in such films as 1947's ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" and 1950's ""Never a Dull Moment."" But for several years she was best known as the Santa Claus-believing child in 1947's ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" opposite Maureen O'Hara and Edmund Gwenn. She later looked back at her childhood years with pain and a little fury. ""I spent practically all my time in the company of adults. I was very withdrawn, very shy, I did what I was told and I tried not to disappoint anybody. I knew I had a duty to perform, and I was trained to follow orders,"" she once said. Her relationship with her mother was often bitter. Glamour to spare . It wasn't until the groundbreaking ""Rebel Without a Cause"" (1955), also starring James Dean and Sal Mineo, that she broke through into mature roles. The film featured Wood as the girlfriend of Dean's angst-ridden Jim Stark in the role that made Dean a generational symbol. Wood was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for her performance. But it was two 1961 films, the film version of the Broadway smash ""West Side Story"" and the romantic tragedy ""Splendor in the Grass,"" that made her a top-tier movie star. In ""West Side Story,"" a version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" set among New York's gang culture, Wood played Maria, the ill-fated heroine. Though her singing voice was dubbed, her performance earned her good reviews in what became one of the most lauded movies of all time. ""Splendor in the Grass"" was no slouch, either; for her performance opposite Warren Beatty, Wood picked up an Oscar nomination for best actress. The press paid attention. Wood had glamour to spare; she was often touted, along with Elizabeth Taylor and Sophia Loren, as one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. She also had a photogenic marriage to the hunky Wagner, whom she had married in 1957 when she was 18 and he was 27. The marriage was one of the most celebrated of its time. ""We drove a Corvette across the country. Radio stations would announce we had just passed through, and people would wait for us in every little town,"" Wood told People magazine in 1976. But that marriage to Wagner didn't last; the pair divorced in 1962. She married her second husband, agent Richard Gregson, in 1969. The two had a daughter, Natasha. There were some dark moments -- Wood attempted suicide in 1966 -- but on the whole she gained confidence as an actress in the '60s. (Hardcore psychoanalysis -- she went almost daily for several years -- didn't hurt.) She was named ""Star of the Year"" by theater owners in 1963 and appeared in a series of popular films, including ""Gypsy"" (1962), ""Sex and the Single Girl"" (1963) and ""The Great Race"" (1965). Though she turned down some challenging roles, including one in ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" she bounced back with the wife-swapping comedy ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"" (1969), for which she earned a reputed $3 million (thanks to shrewdly taking a cut of the profits). However, except for a handful of roles, ""Bob & Carol"" also marked the end of a chapter in Wood's film career. She divorced Gregson in 1972 and, having reconciled with Wagner, remarried him later that year. She told People that she had few qualms about putting her career on the back burner. ""If a woman decides to get married and have children, other parts of her life are just going to have to be put aside,"" she said. By many accounts, she and Wagner had a stronger marriage the second time around. They had a daughter, Courtney, and stood out as one of Hollywood's power couples. Wood stayed busy with the occasional TV movie. Troubled production, mysterious end . ""Brainstorm"" earned coverage not only for Wood's casting -- it was just her third theatrical movie since ""Bob & Carol"" -- but also for its technological trappings. The director, Douglas Trumbull, was renowned for his special-effects work on ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" and the movie was being shot in a special format. But ""Brainstorm"" was plagued by production troubles, and rumors started circulating about Wood and Walken's relationship, as TCM.com notes in its writeup of the film. Wagner, who visited the North Carolina set during a break from his TV series ""Hart to Hart,"" had suspicions. ""The bell wasn't exactly clanging, but I was aware that I didn't have her full attention,"" he wrote in his 2008 memoir. ""She was more involved with the movie than she was with her family, and the thought occurred to me that Natalie was being emotionally unfaithful."" Filming continued in Hollywood, and during the Thanksgiving holiday, Wagner and Wood invited Walken to relax on their boat, Splendour, named for ""Splendor in the Grass."" The rest is lost in the murky water off the California coast on November 29, 1981, when Wood died. At her funeral, her pallbearers included Frank Sinatra, Fred Astaire, Laurence Olivier and Gregory Peck. The aftermath affected lives well away from the boat. The studio wanted to shut down filming; Trumbull had to find other financing to complete the movie. Upon its 1983 release, ""Brainstorm"" was a box office dud, and Trumbull never directed another film. Dr. Thomas Noguchi, the Los Angeles County coroner, was demoted in 1982 after an investigation by the county board of supervisors over issues with his job, including publicity-seeking after the deaths of celebrities. Wagner mourned Wood's death for years before marrying Jill St. John, one of Wood's closest friends, in 1990. Though her image has faded in comparison with some of her contemporaries, such as Taylor or Dean, she's still looked up to by young actresses. Vanessa Hudgens, the ""High School Musical"" star, calls Wood her ""idol."" Wood herself was blunt about her impact. ""Let's face it, acting is not important. Einstein is important. Jonas Salk is important. I know they're not going to send my latest movie up in a time capsule,"" she once said. What she desired, apparently, was more out of life. Some time before her death she gave an interview and was asked if she was satisfied. After all, she had two children, a terrific husband, fame, money and beauty. What more could she want? She didn't hesitate: ""I want yesterday.""","Natalie Wood was major movie star, considered one of world's most beautiful and talented .

1520,"(CNN) -- Six people, including three children, were killed when their plane crashed into rugged mountains east of Phoenix on a Thanksgiving eve trip, authorities said Thursday. Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu identified the dead as a father and his three children, plus two other men. All were Arizona residents and knew each other well, he said. The twin-engine Rockwell 690A airplane slammed into a steep cliff near the top of the Superstition Mountains at 6:31 p.m. on Wednesday, strewing debris for hundreds of yards down the 80-degree incline, Babeu told reporters. Recovery efforts by more than 50 deputies and volunteers involved collect and preserving the remains, the sheriff said. ""No one could survive that crash,"" he said. The plane had flown from Safford to Mesa, where it picked up the siblings -- ages 9, 8 and 6 -- for the Thanksgiving holiday, Babeu said. ""All of these families are just obviously heartbroken, traumatized over the loss of their loved ones so suddenly here on Thanksgiving,"" he said. Federal officials were expected to begin their investigation as soon as Thursday, according to Babeu. A man who said he witnessed the impact told CNN that a mushroom cloud of flames lit up the evening sky. Kevin Cunningham, 44, of Apache Junction, said he was talking on the phone from his back porch and saw the crash a few miles away. ""The flames lit up the mountain,"" said Cunningham, adding the plane appeared to be flying level before the crash. ""I didn't see where it was in distress."" CNN's Phil Gast and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: The dead include three children on a Thanksgiving trip with their father .

1521,"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Seven crew members from a South Korean cargo ship remained missing Tuesday after the boat sank Monday in the South China Sea, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said. Fourteen people have been rescued, according to the ministry. The ship was headed from Penang, Malaysia, to China and disappeared after sending out an emergency signal Monday afternoon. While six South Koreans and eight crew members from Myanmar were rescued by nearby vessels, seven seamen are still missing. The Foreign Ministry said it is still hopeful, as one crew member was rescued at noon on Tuesday -- almost 20 hours after the ship requested assistance. Hong Kong rescuers have deployed two helicopters and seven ships to help with the search and rescue operation, while two Chinese naval vessels were en route to the scene, according to the Foreign Ministry. The 15,000-ton sunken vessel is the same ship that was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2008 when eight sailors were held captive for 37 days, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.

1523,"(CNN) -- In an upstate New York town ravaged by the wrathful remnants of Hurricane Irene in late August, 12 displaced families will break bread together at Thanksgiving dinner. ""We are trying to rebuild,"" said Ken Aurigema, who with the help of his family will be cooking for at least 30 people Thursday at the Catskill Christian Assembly, one of the few structures in the small town of Prattsville to survive the devastation of the storm and its enduring aftermath. Upstate New York faced some of the worst and most extensive amount of flooding in Irene's fury, along with New Jersey and Vermont, said Chris Vaccaro spokesman for the National Weather Service. Over 7 million homes and businesses from North Carolina northward up the Eastern Seaboard lost power in the record-setting 10th billion-dollar disaster for the United States this year, Vaccaro said. Irene broke the previous record of nine billion-dollar disasters set in 2008. The estimated damage is more than $7.3 billion dollars total. ""Wind is not the only threat -- inland flooding can be one of the deadliest hazards within a tropical storm,"" Vaccaro said. Most of the families dining together Thursday previously lived in one of the 15 now-unoccupied houses along Main Street, where creek swelling and flood damage turned those structures into wrecked skeletons of homes that need rebuilding, or that have been condemned. The dinner invitation extends across Greene County to neighboring towns including Lexington and Windham, where countless homes and businesses also were destroyed. This was the first time a hurricane made landfall in the New York area since Hurricane Gloria struck Long Island in 1985. Hurricane Bob in 1991 came just shy of touching down east of the Long Island's twin forks. What began as a Category 1 hurricane in North Carolina had weakened into a tropical storm when it made a second landfall in New York's Coney Island, and continued northward through Connecticut, Massachusetts and then Vermont. ""The Northeast is prone to witnessing a tropical storm system, it's not just Florida the Gulf or (the) Carolinas. If you live along (the) coastline east or south, you are susceptible,"" Vaccaro told CNN. ""Irene was a reminder of that,"" he said. Thanksgiving dinner host Aurigema, an electrical contractor who lost his truck, tools, and customers to Irene, had been living in Greene County with his wife and son for 16 years before the storm slashed through his tiny town. Irene demolished the first floor of his Prattsville home, drowned his foundation in creek backwash and waterlogged his floor with three feet of flooding that soon after became caked mud. Having also directed the Catskill Christian Academy for 16 years, Aurigema is grateful the ministry has let him and his family take solace on their grounds for the past two months. He hopes to be out during December, by the 15th or by Christmas. When he drives down Main Street, Aurigema said, ""It's hard to comprehend how you are going to rebuild the town."" ""When I leave at night, it's sad to see none of the stores being open. I think for the most part we are on the mend; I am worried about how many people are going to move back here."" Some 20 mom-and-pop businesses, even the grocery store, were out of commission for weeks after Irene shredded the edges of nearby Schoharie Creek, Prattsville town spokesman Al Creazzo told CNN. Shaun Groden, Greene County administrator said, ""There was complete devastation, the entire village, there was not a single building in the entire town that went unscathed. Most were half knocked off (their) foundation, or worse, collapsed."" ""There are still houses boarded up, probably just awaiting the wrecking ball,"" said Groden. Groden explained that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has categorized most of the damaged structures as being in what are now deemed flood zones, and that banks are reluctant to finance rebuilding in these zones, for fear of future flooding. ""The question is, can you literally pick up a home and move a quarter mile back to get it off the bank?"" Groden asked. From a municipal planning standpoint, he said, the reconstruction could take months. According to spokeswoman Rachel Racusen, FEMA has approved a total of more than $93 million in assistance to individuals affected by Hurricane Irene, to date. Creazzo said FEMA would be ""rolling in houses"" in about two weeks, with between 20 and 22 temporary homes arriving for Prattsville residents. He explained that in the meantime, displaced families have been staying with relatives and friends. ""In these towns, the families go back generations on generations. There is always someone living close by."" Slowly but surely, Creazzo said, businesses are beginning to show signs of life. ""First the supermarket, then Beth's CafÃ©, and Kenny opened up the Tavern last week,"" he said, with the ring of small-town familiarity in his words. As it does every year, the town is working hard to finish projects before the winter. The asphalt contractors are closing up shop in time for Thanksgiving, and all roads left unpaved will be gravel through the winter months. They have already replaced six of the eight bridges lost in the flood with temporary structures that Groden anticipated will hold through spring. Aurigema told CNN he is impressed by how the people of the Prattsville community have come together. ""That's why we decided to stay up here,"" he said. Since day one, facing the aftermath of the devastating storm, family, friends and neighbors lent their hands and their shovels to clear the mud out of his family's home. ""We are coming back to life, little by little,"" Aurigema said. On the more immediate topic of side dishes, table fixings and how to prepare a meal for 30 or more hungry mouths, Aurigema said, ""Well, we don't know!"" ""We are a big family and we are used to cooking for large groups. We are just grateful to give back to the community we love."" On the menu for Thanksgiving in Prattsville are turkey, corn, beans, potatoes, stuffing, yams, pies and cookies and -- Aurigema's brother's favorite -- macaroni and cheese.","The small town of Prattsville in upstate New York was ravaged by Irene .

1524,"(CNN) -- South Korean golfer K.J. Choi has pledged $100,000 to the Japan disaster relief fund through his personal charity foundation. The 40-year-old, who won two tournaments on the Japanese circuit before becoming the first from his country to qualify for the U.S. PGA Tour, will give the money to the American Red Cross. ""It is shocking and terribly sad to see what is happening every day in Japan and the difficulty they face in overcoming this disaster. The situation in Japan impacts us all on a global level,"" Choi said in a statement on Friday. ""This is the time for us to join our hands together and do all we can to help our friends in Japan. I have special memories of playing in Japan as it set the stepping stone in helping me to become the first Korean to earn a PGA Tour card. ""Through the K.J. Choi Foundation, I want to implement projects that can attract continuous interest and support to help our neighbors in Japan."" Choi has followed the example set by Japanese golfer Ryuji Imada, who is also playing at the Transitions Championship in Tampa Bay, Florida. Imada wrote a note on Wednesday stating that he would donate $1,000 for every birdie score he makes at the tournament this week, and left copies in the media room and players' locker area asking for similar contributions. The Hiroshima native, who moved to the U.S. in 1990 at the age of 14 to pursue a career as a golfer, carded no birdies in his opening round of 74 on Thursday but managed two in his 75 on Friday. He was 16 shots behind American leaders Chris Couch and Garrett Willis as he missed the halfway cut along with 19-year-old compatriot Ryo Ishikawa (73) and seven-time PGA Tour winner Choi (75). Spain's Sergio Garcia made a welcome return to form with a 66 that left him tied for third with American Webb Simpson, a shot behind the leaders. World No. 1 Martin Kaymer was five shots off the pace, tied for 26th in a group including last weekend's WGC-Cadillac Championship winner Nick Watney. Meanwhile, English golfer Anthony Wall has credited a cheap mobile-phone application for the form which has taken him to the top of the leaderboard at the halfway stage of the European Tour's Sicilian Open. Seeking to follow up his maiden victory 11 years ago, the 35-year-old carded a bogey-free four-under-par 67 in Friday's second round to claim a two-shot lead at Donnafugata Golf Resort. He said tips from former European Tour player Tony Johnstone had helped his putting stroke, but an iPhone application about reading greens by noted short-game specialist David Stockton -- who has helped the likes of three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson -- had really paid off. ""That is the best 59 pence (95 cents)  I have ever spent because his tips have really simplified a few things for me,"" Wall told the European Tour website. ""I have just been looking at the low side of every putt for the last two days -- really concentrating on the last third of the putt as opposed to the whole putt -- and that has definitely helped me. I haven't holed everything but I have hit my putts a lot better. ""It was a bargain, I have to say -- you don't get many valuable lessons for 59 pence these days! The thing about Dave Stockton is that he is and always was an amazing putter, and you tend to listen to those guys a bit more."" Wall, ranked 206th in the world, is being chased by Australia's No. 64 Richard Green and France's Raphael Jacquelin, both on seven-under 135. Left-hander Green, at 64th the top player in the field, bounced back from a double-bogey at his opening hole to card 67, with birdies at two of his last three greens. They are followed by a group of five players tied for fourth on 137, while former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie was in a bunch of six another shot back after his second successive 69.","K.J.

1525,"(CNN) -- A warrant has been issued for a New Jersey man who is suspected in the death of his 2-year-old daughter, authorities announced Wednesday. Multiple law-enforcement agencies are searching for Arthur E. Morgan III, authorities said at a news conference. A group of boys discovered the child's body partly submerged in a stream in Shark River Park in Monmouth County on Tuesday afternoon, officials said. She was strapped into her car seat, CNN affiliate WABC reported. The stream runs beneath an overpass, suggesting that the child and car seat were thrown from the overpass, said county prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni. Morgan was supposed to return the child to her mother Monday night following a custody visit, Gramiccioni said. When he didn't return the girl, prosecutors in Ocean County on Tuesday morning charged him with endangering the welfare of a child and interfering with child custody. The girl was found dead about 20 hours later, WABC reported. Police say Morgan was last seen between 7 and 8 p.m. Monday on the Asbury Park train platform. A number of federal and state agencies, including the FBI, are involved in the search, suggesting that Morgan might try to leave New Jersey, where he and the child's mother live separately, Gramiccioni said. ""Police are working with every ounce of their being to locate him,"" Monmouth County Prosecutor Peter E. Warshaw Jr. said.

1526,"(CNN) -- At least 361 people have died and 600,000 were living in refugee camps because of flooding in Pakistan, the country's national disaster authority said Tuesday. The flooding in Sindh and Balochistan provinces has destroyed 1.5 million homes in 41,000 villages, the government said. The United Nations World Food Program has been distributing food, starting in the hard-hit city of Badin. As of Friday, more than 15,000 people have received assistance, the agency said. The agency estimated that 73% of food crops in the flood zone and 36% of livestock were lost or destroyed. The United Nations said Monday that it is seeking donors to build a $357 million fund to help the Pakistani government's flood response efforts. It is meant to provide food, water, sanitation, health care and shelter for some flood victims for up to six months. ""More than five million people are struggling to survive massive flooding across southern Pakistan, and the rains continue to fall,"" said Valerie Amos, the U.N. under-secretary-general for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. Last year, Pakistan was also the site of massive and deadly flooding. In August 2010, weeks of flooding caused $9.7 billion in damages to homes, roads and farms in southwest Pakistan. More than 1,700 people died in the 2010 flooding, and more than 20 million were displaced. CNN's Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","More deaths are reported from the flooding, officials say .

1527,"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Buddhist nun in southwest China has died after setting herself on fire, the 11th Tibetan -- and second nun -- to self-immolate since March. The death of the nun, identified as Qiu Xiang, was reported by state-run Xinhua and confirmed by exile groups. The 35-year old set herself on fire at a road crossing in Dawu County, in the Ganzi region of Sichuan Province, the South China Morning Post said, citing Xinhua. It was unclear why she killed herself, though Tibetan campaign groups say it was in protest against Chinese rule. But China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed the incident related to ""pro-Tibetan independence forces"" overseas. ""Everyone knows that nowadays, except for the very few evil cults and extremist forces, all religions advocate respect for human life and oppose violence,"" said spokesperson Hong Lei. ""It is a challenge to the moral bottom line of all human beings if, instead of condemning the extreme act of self-immolation, some people are hyping or instigating it."" According to the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT), which advocates Tibetan independence, Palden Choetso -- Qiu's Tibetan name -- called for freedom and the return from exile of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, as she was burning. London-based Free Tibet also confirmed the incident. Her body was then taken by fellow nuns into the Ganden Choeling nunnery in Tawu, the ICT said. Six of the 11Tibetans -- all monks or former monks -- who have set themselves ablaze died from their injuries. Most of the suicide attempts occurred in Aba Prefecture and the Kirti monastery, also in Sichuan, which has become a focal point for ethnic Tibetans angry at the erosion of their culture. Last month, a nun in Ngaba County, Sichuan Province, became the first Tibetan woman known to have killed herself. Free Tibet said Tenzin Wangmo, 20, died outside the Dechen Chokorling Nunnery. The State Administration for Religious Affairs in Beijing told CNN they were not aware of the incident. Activists and exiled Tibetans say the disturbing acts reflect an increasingly repressive environment under Beijing's control. ""The incidents are a clear indication of the genuine grievances of the Tibetans and their sense of deep resentment and despair over the prevailing conditions in Tibet,"" said new Tibetan leader in exile, Lobsang Sangay, in quotes carried by Free Tibet. ""It is therefore of the utmost urgency that every possible effort be made to address the underlying root causes of Tibetan grievances and resentment."" A statement from the Tibetan government in exile in Dharamsala, India read: ""The Kashag (Cabinet) would like to make it clear that it stands in solidarity with the Tibetan people in Tibet who endure continued suppression under the Chinese authorities, whose short-sighted policies have driven till now eleven Tibetans to set themselves on fire. ""Instead of addressing the real problems that drive Tibetans to commit self-immolation, Xinhua, the official news organ of the Chinese government, blames the Tibetans-in-exile for instigating such desperate and despairing acts. ""The Kashag strongly urges the Chinese government to stop hurling baseless allegations and to start solving the real problems. (The) People's Republic of China can do this by stopping its repressive policy on Tibet and allowing more freedom of religion and speech."" Prominent Tibetan writer and activist Tsering Woeser told CNN this kind of protest will continue as long as the Chinese government's Tibet policy remains the same. ""If there is no improvement Tibetans will feel it's better to die than be alive. They commit suicide to protest,"" she said. ""The international community should impose pressure and condemn the Chinese government,"" she added. ""But so far, the pressure is not enough, the international community only appeals to Chinese government but there are no real actions such as economic boycott."" In an interview with CNN last month, Woeser said Tibetan Buddhists can't use violence against others to protest, so they harm themselves to people pay attention to their plight. ""This is not suicide. This is sacrifice in order to draw the world's attention,"" she said. China rejects accusations of oppression of Tibetans, saying its rule has greatly improved living standards for the Tibetan people. The Dalai Lama's representative signed an agreement with Beijing in 1951 to affirm China's sovereignty over Tibet but also grant autonomy to the area. A failed uprising against Beijing's rule in 1959 forced the Dalai Lama into exile. The Dalai Lama denies seeking independence for Tibet, saying he wants genuine autonomy, under which Tibetans can make their own policies on key issues, such as religious practices. In a 2008 uprising, violent unrest in Tibet and the subsequent military crackdown left at least 18 dead, and activists say tensions have remained high in many areas since then.

1528,"(CNN) -- Unsanitary conditions at a Colorado cantaloupe farm's packing facility are a possible contributing cause of one of the nation's worst outbreaks of listeria contamination in food, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Centers for Disease Control official said it is too early to declare the outbreak over, but the number of new cases appeared to be diminishing. ""The peak in illnesses appears to have occurred from late August until the middle of September,"" said Dr. Barbara Mahon of the CDC, who added that additional monitoring will be needed for at least another two weeks. The FDA said it was unable to pinpoint the definitive cause of the outbreak, which has been linked to 25 deaths so far. An FDA letter to Jensen Farms of Granada, Colorado, however, cited violations in sanitary conditions that must be addressed. It said tests showed ""widespread contamination throughout your facility and indicates poor sanitary practices in the facility."" The agency cited several likely causes of the spread of the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria at Jensen Farms. The likely causes included packing equipment that ""was not easily cleaned and sanitized"" and the use of washing and drying equipment for cantaloupe packing as well as other raw agricultural commodities. In addition, the agency said in a statement, the facility lacked a ""pre-cooling step"" to remove field heat from the cantaloupes before cold storage, possibly leading to condensation in the cooling process that promoted growth of the listeria bacteria. A letter dated Tuesday from the FDA to Jensen Farms cited violations in sanitary conditions. The letter said tests at the facility found listeria bacteria contamination. ""These positive swabs were taken from different locations throughout the washing and packing areas in your facility, all of which were either food contact surfaces or areas adjacent to food contact surfaces,"" the letter said. ""This significant percentage of swabs that tested positive for outbreak strains of Listeria monocytogenes demonstrates widespread contamination throughout your facility and indicates poor sanitary practices in the facility."" According to the letter, the company has 15 days to document steps it has taken to correct the problems. The letter also said the company notified the FDA on Monday that it agreed to inspection by the agency of its growing, packaging, and cold storage operations before it resumes food harvesting, packaging, or processing. Jensen Farms also agreed to correct all objectionable observations noted during said FDA inspections, the letter said. A total of 123 people in 26 states have been infected by the listeria outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Additionally, a woman who was pregnant at the time of her illness had a miscarriage, the agency said. The listeria outbreak is the deadliest food-borne illness outbreak in the United States since 1998. Groups at high risk for listeria include older adults, people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women. Jensen Farms issued a voluntary recall of its Rocky Ford brand cantaloupes on September 14. The tainted cantaloupes should be off store shelves, the CDC has said. Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms should be disposed of immediately, even if some of them have been eaten, the agency recommended. If consumers are uncertain about the source of a cantaloupe, they are urged to ask their supermarket. If the source remains unknown, the fruit should be thrown out. Refrigerating a cantaloupe will not kill the bacteria, which can grow at low temperatures, and consumers should not try to wash off the bacteria.","The outbreak is not over, but new cases are on the decline .

1529,"(CNN) -- The number of deaths linked to cantaloupes contaminated with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria has risen to 23, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Wednesday. At least 116 cases of listeria have been reported in 25 states, the agency said. The two latest fatalities came in Louisiana. The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals confirmed this week that an 87-year-old Baton Rouge woman died earlier this month. Last week the department also indentified a Shreveport-area woman, 81, who died from the same strain. Health officials have said the number of cases could continue to grow, citing reporting lags and the fact the disease can develop slowly in some people, taking up to two months. The listeria outbreak is the deadliest food-borne illness outbreak in the United States since 1998. Five people each have died in New Mexico and Colorado from consuming the tainted fruit, along with two people each in Kansas, Texas and now Louisiana. One has died in Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma and Wyoming, the CDC said. In addition, one woman who was pregnant at the time of the illness had a miscarriage. Cases have also been reported in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Illinois, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Groups at high risk for listeria include older adults, people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women, officials have said. The grower, Jensen Farms of Granada, Colorado, issued a voluntary recall of its Rocky Ford brand cantaloupes on September 14. The tainted cantaloupes should be off store shelves, the CDC said.

1530,"Washington (CNN) -- If the government does not take drastic steps, another deepwater oil spill like the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico could devastate the coastal areas of the United States, an oversight commission warned Tuesday in a long-awaited report to the president. More research, funding and oversight are needed to help prevent another disaster, concluded the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. ""As drilling pushes into ever deeper and riskier waters where more of America's oil lies, only systemic reforms of both government and industry will prevent a similar, future disaster,"" said William K. Reilly, the commission co-chairman. Halliburton criticized the report's conclusions, saying the commission selectively omitted information it submitted. The disaster ""was almost the inevitable result of years of industry and government complacency and lack of attention to safety,"" Reilly said. The disaster led to the worst maritime oil spill in U.S. history. That was ""indisputably the case"" with BP; Transocean, which owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig; and Halliburton, which installed a cement casing for drill operations, he said. It also was the case with the government agency charged with regulating offshore drilling, Reilly said. The report, ""Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling,"" proposed ""comprehensive"" government and industry actions ""to overhaul the U.S. approach to drilling safety and greatly reduce the chances of a similar, large-scale disaster in the future."" Over the past 20 years ""we became lulled into a sense of inevitable success,"" which masked the heightened risk in deepwater drilling, said the commission's co-chair, former Sen. Bob Graham. Advances in science, both in drilling offshore safely and in containing a spill, are vastly inadequate and must be improved, Graham said. The commission faulted the government for passivity, saying regulators were outmatched, underfunded and had conflicting responsibilities that kept them from effective oversight. They called for a new regulatory office headed by a scientist with a fixed term that would be created under the Interior Department. The position would be designed to remain more immune to industry pressures than current oversight agencies. Since the spill, there have already been reforms and new rules requiring companies to strengthen safety practices and modernize equipment, said Kendra Barkoff, deputy communications director for the Interior Department. ""Over the last eight months, the Department of Interior has undertaken an aggressive overhaul of the regulatory agency responsible for overseeing offshore oil and gas operations, increasing safety and ensuring oil and gas development is conducted responsibly,"" she said. The commission, convened by the president this summer, cited a systemic failure in the oil industry, blaming all three companies -- BP, Transocean and Halliburton -- involved in constructing the Deepwater Horizon rig. ""The industry needs to pick up its own game,"" said Reilly, who said the industry was already considering the commission's charge that it form a self-policing ""safety institute."" Halliburton spokeswoman Cathy Mann criticized the report's conclusions, saying the commission ""selectively omitted information provided to it by Halliburton in response to its numerous inquiries."" Mann specifically noted what she described as a mischaracterization of the February and April foam stability tests related to the cement pumped at the deepwater well, according to a company statement Tuesday. Transocean spokesperson Samantha Cohen blamed BP for the incident, lauding the Transocean crew who ""took appropriate actions to gain control of the well."" She added that ""it would be premature to draw final conclusions at this juncture,"" according to a written statement. In contrast, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said his organization commends ""the oil spill commission for its thorough and thoughtful examination of the worst environmental disaster in our nation's history."" ""This report is very timely, following a severe Alaskan pipeline leak this past week that reinforced the need for us to take a hard look at safety standards and our nation's addiction to oil,"" he said in a written statement. To help fund some recommendations, the commission suggested both raising fines on oil companies and charging them for a lease to drill off the U.S. coastline. BP said Tuesday it cooperated fully with the commission. ""Given the emerging consensus that the Deepwater Horizon accident was the result of multiple causes involving multiple parties, we support the commission's efforts to strengthen industrywide safety practices,"" BP spokeswoman Ellen Moskowitz said. ""We are committed to working with government officials and other operators and contractors to identify and implement operational and regulatory changes that will enhance safety practices throughout the oil and gas industry."" The commission recommended lifting the $75 million liability cap for offshore facility incidents, but said the members could not agree on whether an oil company's liability should be unlimited. Reilly said it would be unreasonable to expect the bill to be sent to the public if the companies cause billions in dollars of damages. He suggested smaller independent oil companies could join an insurance pool to cover their risk. The commission found several ""preventable human and engineering failures were the immediate causes"" of the BP disaster. However, the commission did not weigh in on whether BP, Transocean or Halliburton broke the law in developing the Deepwater Horizon rig, and deferred the question of criminal charges to the Department of Justice. Members answered media questions Tuesday about contentious debates over drilling near Florida and Alaska. Graham referenced former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's call to ""drill, baby, drill,"" a battle cry co-opted by proponents of drilling off Florida's coast. ""The numbers are not sustainable,"" Graham said when asked about drilling off Florida. ""We need to be holding back some areas that have potential for future generations."" However, members did not object to continued drilling off Alaska, instead calling for more safety research, funds that would allow for more training for the Coast Guard in the state and new organizational structure that would allow for input from local communities. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents more than 400 oil and natural gas companies, said the group is pleased with the commission's recommendation to increase funding for more federal inspection and monitoring of offshore activity. However, API Upstream Director Erik Milito said the group is concerned that the report reflects negatively on an entire industry based on a single incident. ""This does a great disservice to the thousands of men and women who work in the industry and have the highest personal and professional commitment to safety,"" Milito said. The commission met with President Barack Obama Tuesday before presenting its report to Congress. The commission emphasized its message was clear and unanimous, and was delivered on time -- a rarity in Washington. ""Drilling offshore is inherently risky and we can never reduce the risk to zero,"" Graham said. ""But we can mitigate the risk.""","NEW: Halliburton says the report unfairly criticizes them .

1531,"(CNN) -- A satellite whose orbit is degrading is likely to crash back to Earth on Friday, and 26 pieces have a good chance of surviving the heat of re-entry, NASA said. Despite being pretty sure that the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, or UARS, will re-enter the atmosphere sometime Friday afternoon, U.S. time, NASA says there is no way to know where it will fall. Because the satellite travels thousands of miles in a matter of minutes, even minutes before re-entry, it will be impossible to pinpoint an exact location, Mark Matney of NASA's Orbital Debris team said Wednesday. On top of that, he said, ""part of the problem is the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it's coming down even right before the re-entry."" NASA says most of the six-ton spacecraft is made of aluminum, which has a relatively low melting temperature and will burn up on re-entry. But about half a ton of material is likely to make it through. ""There are some pieces that are made of stainless steel and titanium and beryllium that have very high melting temperatures, and those pieces will survive,"" Matney said. He said NASA has identified 26 pieces, ranging from tens of pounds to a few hundred pounds, that could make it. Because water covers about 70 percent of the Earth's surface, NASA believes most, if not all the debris that survives will land in an ocean or sea. And even if pieces strike dry land, there's very little risk any will hit people. Objects this size re-enter the Earth's atmosphere about once a year, according to NASA. This is the largest NASA satellite to re-enter in about 30 years, but at six tons, it's only a fraction of the size of the 75-ton Skylab that fell back to Earth in 1979.

1532,"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra warned Saturday that more water would pour into the capital, Bangkok, as the country endures its worst flood in half a century, state media reported. Giving her weekly television address to the nation, Shinawatra said efforts were being made to manage the flow of floodwaters to minimize the impact on residents. Extra protection would be given to historical sites, palaces, hospitals, business districts, utilities and transportation infrastructure, state-run news agency MCOT quoted her as saying. The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters for victims of flooding in affected provinces, Shinawatra said, according to the agency. There are currently more than 113,000 people staying at the shelters, which can cater for about 800,000, she said. The government had hoped that strengthening flood barriers and widening canals would keep populated areas safe. But now the government is trying a different tack: opening floodgates to relieve pressure on dams and levees and send the water toward the sea. The decision to divert water through canals in Bangkok means parts of the city, and its surrounding suburbs such as Rangsit, are flooded. The flooding, which follows months of monsoon rains, has already killed 356 people, with nearly 9 million others affected, authorities said. Overall damage from the floods could top $2 billion, with the worst yet to come as the waters destroy shops and paralyze factories nationwide, the Thai Finance Ministry said. Many residents waded through dirty water in the capital Friday as they made a desperate attempt to save their belongings. Among them was a teary-eyed woman named Surirat Prapankarn, from a suburb outside Bangkok, who could be seen lugging her sodden possessions through waist-high water. Pulling her things out of her front room, Prapankarn said she was overcome with sadness when she looked at her destroyed home and at what had been lost. She wondered how she would find food for her 16 dogs. Waters rose overnight in the northern Bangkok suburb of Rangsit, giving residents little chance to save what they could. The lucky few moved out of flooded homes by boat, or anything that could float. The rest waded through water with plastic bags balanced on their heads. Pets could be seen tucked into coats or pushed inside boats. Children, meanwhile, seemed to struggle to stay on their feet against the fast-moving water. Another resident, named Saisamorn Pongsairak, said she had lived in the inundated Rangsit neighborhood all her life. ""I woke up this morning around 2 a.m. and the water was only at my ankle high. But now it is up to my waist,"" she said. Pongsairak runs a food store, which she said she refuses to close, frying chicken in waist-high water on an elevated stove. Thailand's prime minister has urged all Bangkok residents to move their belongings to higher ground as government workers endeavor to contain the flooding. Government spokeswoman Thitima Chaisaeng said the move was a precautionary measure. To protect their cars, residents double parked along elevated highways, making it nearly impossible to navigate a city where traffic is congested on a normal day. On Thursday, authorities expressed confidence that the main international airport, Suvarnabhumi Airport, was prepared to withstand the water's impact. Airport officials said a 3.5-meter-high flood prevention wall protects the airport. Thailand derives a significant portion of its revenue from tourism.

1534,"Miami (CNN) -- A defunct satellite plummeting toward Earth is expected to re-enter the atmosphere between 11:45 p.m. Friday and 12:45 a.m. Saturday ET, NASA reported late Friday evening. ""During that time period, the satellite will be passing over Canada and Africa, as well as vast areas of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. The risk to public safety is very remote,"" the space agency said. The United States is once again an unlikely but potential target for the 26 pieces of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, expected to survive the descent. Those pieces, made of stainless steel, titanium and beryllium that won't burn, will range from about 10 pounds to hundreds of pounds, according to NASA. ""There is a low probability any debris that survives re-entry will land in the United States,"" NASA headquarters said, ""but the possibility cannot be discounted because of this changing rate of descent."" Mark Matney of NASA's Orbital Debris team in Houston said there's no way to know exactly where the pieces will come down. ""Keep in mind, they won't be traveling at those high orbital velocities. As they hit the air, they tend to slow down. ... They're still traveling fast, a few tens to hundreds of miles per hour, but no longer those tremendous orbital velocities,"" he explained. Because the satellite travels thousands of miles in a matter of minutes as it orbits -- even just before it begins re-entry -- it will be impossible to pinpoint the exact location the pieces will come down. On top of that, Matney said, the satellite is not stable. ""Part of the problem is, the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways, and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it's coming down even right before the re-entry."" Because water covers 70% of the Earth's surface, NASA has said that most if not all of the surviving debris will land in water. Even if pieces strike dry land, there's very little risk any of it will hit people. However, in an abundance of caution, the Federal Aviation Administration released an advisory Thursday warning pilots about the falling satellite, calling it a potential hazard. ""It is critical that all pilots/flight crew members report any observed falling space debris to the appropriate (air traffic control) facility and include position, altitude, time and direction of debris observed,"" the FAA statement said. The FAA said warnings of this sort typically are sent out to pilots concerning specific hazards they may encounter during flights such as air shows, rocket launches, kites and inoperable radio navigational aids. NASA says space debris the size of the satellite's components re-enters the atmosphere about once a year. Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell noted that the satellite is far from being the biggest space junk to come back. ""This is nothing like the old Skylab scare of the '70s, when you had a 70-ton space station crashing out of the sky. So, I agree with the folks in Houston. It's nothing to be worried about,"" McDowell said. Pieces of Skylab came down in western Australia in 1979. The only wild card McDowell sees is if somehow a chunk hits a populated area. ""If the thing happens to come down in a city, that would be bad. The chances of it causing extensive damage or injuring someone are much higher."" NASA said that once the debris hits the atmosphere 50 miles up, it will take only a matter of minutes before the surviving pieces hit the Earth.

1535,"Guadalajara, Mexico (CNN) -- Authorities found 26 bodies Thursday inside three abandoned vehicles in Guadalajara, Mexico, an official said. All the victims were men, said Ulises EnrÃ­quez, a spokesman for the Jalisco delegation of the Attorney General's Office. The vehicles were discovered near a monument on one of the city's main avenues, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing police sources. Jalisco state Attorney General Tomas Coronado Olmos told CNN affiliate TV Azteca that a message was found with the bodies, but he did not disclose what it said. In a Twitter post, Jalisco Gov. Emilio Gonzalez, a former mayor of Guadalajara, said he was ""appalled and outraged"" by the discovery, which came a day after authorities in Sinaloa state found 16 charred bodies inside two trucks that had been set ablaze. Speaking about those bodies and also those found in Guadalajara, Mexico's new interior minister promised to provide federal support. ""I would like to express our solidarity and support to the governments (of Jalisco and Sinaloa) and, in particular, let them know that the federal government will assist in investigating these cases, finding those responsible and making sure these crimes don't go unpunished,"" said Alejandro PoirÃ©, who was sworn in last week. Also Thursday, the Mexican military said it had seized 15 tons of marijuana in a rural area of Jalisco state several hours from the city. About 43,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence since Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced a crackdown on cartels in December 2006, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. But brutal cartel killings are rare in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-most populous city. The city recently hosted the Pan American Games and is scheduled to host a large international book festival next week a few miles away from where the bodies were found. In a security report published before the games began, analysts said Guadalajara would probably be the next hot spot in Mexico's drug war, as the Zetas drug cartel tries to take over turf long dominated by the Sinaloa cartel. The analysis, published in September by Southern Pulse, an online information network focused on Latin America, noted that major offensives were unlikely amid stepped-up security in the city during the high-profile sporting event. ""With over 10,000 police and a quantity of soldiers -- pulled from their duties in Ciudad Juarez -- on special assignment during the games, we would be surprised to register anything more than a slight blip during the games,"" the analysis said. ""Though when they are over, a major criminal offensive for the city could surface in early November, developing into a protracted battle for the city that will last though the end of the year, and possibly well into 2012.""

1536,"(CNN) -- Scientists have found a decline in oxygen levels in the Gulf of Mexico following the BP oil spill but have found no ""dead zones"" as a result, a federal task force reported Tuesday. Levels of dissolved oxygen in deep water have dropped about 20 percent below their long-term average, according to data collected from up to 60 miles from the well at the center of the worst oil spill in U.S. history. But much of that dip appears to be the result of microbes using oxygen to dissolve oil underwater, and the decline is not enough to be fatal to marine life, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration official Steve Murawski, the head the Joint Analysis Group studying the spill's impact. ""Even the lowest observations in all of these was substantially above the threshold,"" Murawski said. The samples were collected from 419 points at varying distances from the ruptured well at the heart of the disaster and at depths as far down as 4,800 feet, the group reported. The task force is made up of NOAA, the Environmental Protection Agency and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The undersea gusher erupted in April, releasing an estimated 4.9 million barrels (205 million gallons) of crude before being temporarily capped in July. The volume of oil -- and the amount of chemical dispersants used to break it up -- have created concerns about the long-term health of the Gulf. At the same time, the spill delivered a severe economic blow to the region, where fisheries and beach resorts are major employers. Early findings from a mid-August survey led by the University of South Florida indicated oil had settled to the bottom of the Gulf further east than previously suspected and at levels toxic to marine life. At about the same time, a team from Georgia Sea Grant and the University of Georgia released a report that estimates that 70 to 79 percent of the oil that leaked from the well ""has not been recovered and remains a threat to the ecosystem."" The latest study ""does not discuss the broad ecosystem consequences of hydrocarbons released into the environment,"" NOAA said. But it concludes that the oil is continuing to break up and disperse underneath the surface, making the emergency of a major oxygen-poor dead zone unlikely. In early August, the federal government estimated that about three-quarters of the oil spilled had either evaporated or been dispersed, or had been skimmed or burned off the surface. The disaster began with an April 20 explosion aboard the oil rig Deepwater Horizon that left 11 men dead. The blast uncorked a BP-owned well off southeastern Louisiana that spewed for 87 days before being temporarily capped.  Operations are under way to permanently seal the well. BP, rig owner Transocean and well cement contractor Halliburton have blamed each other for the disaster. BP plans to release the findings of its internal investigation of the accident on Wednesday, the company said.","Deep-water oxygen levels are down but not deadly, report concludes .

1537,"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration made public all information available throughout the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday in response to a preliminary report that criticized how it handled the disaster. ""This was an unprecedented environmental disaster met with an unprecedented federal response which prevented any of the worst-case scenarios from coming to fruition,"" Gibbs told reporters when asked about the report made public the previous day. ""When we had information, we gave it to the public."" According to the working paper released Wednesday from the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, the administration vastly underestimated the tens of thousands of barrels of oil pouring into the Gulf after the April 20 oil rig explosion that caused the disaster, despite contrary information from scientists using better methodologies. The explosion claimed 11 lives and led to more than 60,000 barrels of oil being spewed into the Gulf daily for almost three months. According to the working paper, the White House Office of Management and Budget squelched higher worst-case estimates accepted by government officials, preventing the public from hearing them. In addition, the commission staff sharply criticized later White House estimates that 75 percent of the oil had been scooped up, burned or naturally dispersed, saying an operational tool -- known as the oil budget -- used by responders failed to accurately account for biodegradation and was not peer-reviewed by scientists. Gibbs acknowledged that some mistakes were made, in particular citing comments regarding the estimated oil dispersal by former White House environmental adviser Carol Browner in one of ""hundreds"" of interviews she gave. However, he insisted that the administration worked with the information available at all times, noting that it was impossible to see or measure the oil spill rate in the initial weeks after the explosion. ""Throughout this process, we got better information,"" Gibbs said. ""When the rig exploded and the blowout preventer failed 5,000 feet below the ocean, nobody could see what happened."" The installation of video cameras and other technology improved the ability to estimate the spill flow in ensuing months, Gibbs said. At the insistence of Energy Secretary Steven Chu, the administration required BP to install pressure monitors to provide the ""best available data on the flow rate,"" he added. The commission working paper said the government's low estimates of oil flow from the spill, as well as the apparent underestimation of how much oil remained in the Gulf, ""created the impression that it was either not fully competent to handle the spill or not fully candid with the American people about the scope of the problem."" Gibbs echoed federal officials who say the low flow-rate estimates did not negatively affect their operations to stop the oil spill, describing the overall effort as the ""most robust federal response that we've ever seen"" to such an accident. However, the 29-page report said: ""Even if responders are correct, however, loss of the public's trust during a disaster is not an incidental public relations problem. The absence of trust fuels public fears, and those fears in turn can cause major harm, whether because the public loses confidence in the federal government's assurances that beaches or seafood are safe, or because the government's lack of credibility makes it harder to build relationships ... that are necessary for effective response actions."" The report is considered a working paper. The commission will issue a formal report on January 12, 2011. The president appointed the commission in June and tasked it with providing recommendations on how to prevent future spills and mitigate the impact of any that do occur. The commission is headed by former Florida governor and former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, a Democrat, and former Environmental Protection Agency administrator William K. Reilly from the Republican administration of President George H.W Bush. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, said BP was providing too-low figures for the oil flow in effort to escape liability. ""Low-balling the flow rate numbers was BP's attempt to hide both the truth and their wallet from the American people,"" Markey said. After the oil rig sank, the U.S. Coast Guard and BP initially put the spill at 1,000 barrels per day. The administration later derived a 5,000-barrels-per-day estimate, depending on an ""unsolicited, one-page document"" based on visual operation of the speed at which the oil was leaking from the end of the riser at the bottom of the Gulf. Despite ""inaccuracies"" in  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists' estimate of 5,000 barrels, the government stuck with that number through May 27, despite estimates from outside experts suggesting a much higher figure, the report said. The panel's staff wrote that in some cases, nongovernment scientists relied on more refined or better-established methodologies. ""It is possible that the early official flow estimates would have been more accurate if the government had either enlisted greater in-house scientific expertise, or enlisted outside scientific expertise by making available the data on which government estimates were based,"" the report said. ""The government appears to have taken an overly casual approach to the calculation and release of the 5,000 barrels a day estimate -- which as the only official estimate for most of May, took on great importance,"" the report said. Soon after the spill, the Minerals Management Service and BP reported a worst-case estimate of 162,000 barrels, but that was replaced by another estimate received by the Coast Guard and NOAA of 64,000 to 110,000 barrels per day. The actual figure turned out to be about 62,000 barrels per day. According to the report, NOAA wanted to make public some of its worst-case models and requested approval from the Office of Management and Budget. That request was denied. On Thursday, NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco challenged some of the working paper's assertions, saying the commission staff erroneously equated NOAA's worst-case scenarios with projections of flow rates. The two were different, she said in a letter to the commission. Lubchenco also said the early flow-rate estimates did not hamper the government response, and that there was no unwarranted delay or squelching of NOAA's information by the Office of Management and Budget. ""The worst-case scenario models and documents had nothing to do with calculation of the flow rate, but they did help inform the Unified Command's preparations for possible eventualities,"" her letter said. ""And the worst-case scenario paper was made public."" A member of the government team assembled to address the gulf between official and independent flow-rate estimates told CNN, ""We were never pressured [by the government] that we should change our [flow rate] number."" Ira Leifer blamed the initially low oil flow-rate estimates on the poor quality of data the group of scientists had from BP. Better video and data led to the rise in the daily oil spill estimate, he said. The report also faulted the government's tracking of the spill. It said a White House official in August claimed 75 percent of the oil was ""gone."" But the response team could not support that claim, panel staffers wrote. That information was never meant ""to be a precise tool,"" and the administration should not have used it as a scientific report, they said. ""It did not attempt to quantify biodegradation, or the exact amounts of remaining, dissolved, and dispersed oil, which were not the targets of response action."" Further, it said, the government's failure to account for the stages of biodegradation increased public confusion of how much oil was actually ""gone."" The federal government later Wednesday said it acted appropriately with regard to spill estimates and the cleanup. ""As for the predictions about the spill flow rate, senior government officials were clear with the public what the worst-case flow rate could be: in early May, [Interior] Secretary [Ken] Salazar and Admiral Thad Allen told the American people [in media interviews] that the worst case scenario could be more than 100,000 barrels a day,"" said a statement from OMB Acting Director Jeffrey Zients and Lubchenco of NOAA. ""The federal government response was full force and immediate, and the response focused on state and local plans and evolved when needed,"" the statement continued. ""As directed by the President, the response was based on science, even when that pitted us against BP or state and local officials, and the response pushed BP every step of the way. Finally, and most importantly, the response provided results for the people of the Gulf Coast."" Regarding the flow and recovery of the spilled oil, Zients and Lubchenco said responders worked with best known information at the time and later came up with improved analysis. ""The facts bear out that the federal response significantly mitigated the impact of the spill,"" they said.

1538,"(CNN) -- Italy's MotoGP star Marco Simoncelli was killed in a crash on the second lap of the Malaysian MotoGP Sunday. The tragic accident happened when Simoncelli came off at Turn 11 of the Sepang circuit while in fourth place. His Honda bike swerved across the track and he was hit by fellow competitors Colin Edwards and Valentino Rossi. Simoncelli, 24, had his helmet knocked off in the crash and he lay motionless on the track. American Edwards also fell but escaped serious injury, while former multi-world champion Rossi returned unhurt to the pits on his Ducati. The race was abandoned and Simoncelli was given emergency treatment at the track's medical center, but it was to no avail. ""Marco Simoncelli succumbed to injuries sustained in the Malaysian MotoGP,"" read a short statement on the official MotoGP website to confirm the fatality. It came just a week after the tragic death of two-time Indianapolis 500 champion Dan Wheldon at a race in Las Vegas. On the same day, 2010 MotoGP champion Jorge Lorenzo crashed as he warmed up for last week's round in Australia and sustained a serious hand injury. Lorenzo's misfortune meant Australian Casey Stoner wrapped up the world title with two races still to go, Sunday's race in Malaysia, and the final round in Spain. Rossi, a seven-time world champion in motorcycling's elite category, left the track devastated by the accident involving his fellow Italian and ""good friend"" Simoncelli. Rossi's team manager at Ducati, Vittoriano Gureschi, gave his reaction. ""Valentino is shocked by this incident. Valentino is a strong man but this incident is a big tragedy. He has lost a good friend,"" he said. The Italian sports community was left stunned by Simoncelli's death and a minute's silence was held at all major events, including Serie A football games.","Italy's Marco Simoncelli dies after an accident at Malaysian Grand Prix .

1539,"(CNN) -- A grandfather who perished in a Christmas day fire at a Connecticut home died from blunt-force head and neck trauma as well as smoke inhalation, while his wife and their three grandchildren died from smoke inhalation, the state medical examiner's office said Wednesday. Authorities said on Tuesday that Lomer Johnson fell through roof rafters outside a window. One of the children's bodies was found just inside the window. It appeared Johnson was trying to get the child out, but died after climbing through the window, said Stamford, Connecticut, Acting Fire Chief Antonio Conte. The medical examiner's office said Wednesday Johnson suffered from smoke inhalation in addition to trauma from the fall. Three young sisters -- a 10-year-old and 7-year-old twins -- died in the fire along with the Johnsons. The girls' mother, Madonna Badger, and a friend escaped the blaze. The fire, which broke out about 5 a.m. Sunday morning in the three-story Victorian home, is believed to have been caused by smoldering embers removed from a fireplace about two hours before and taken to an area in the rear of the house, Stamford Chief Fire Marshal Barry Callahan said. The city of Stamford razed the three-story home on Monday after determining it was unsafe. The million-dollar home in the wealthy Shippan Point neighborhood was under renovation. All that was left of it was the mailbox, around which grieving neighbors placed flowers. CNN affiliate WFSB reported that Badger attempted to climb the renovation scaffolding outside the home in an apparent attempt to reach her family. Witnesses said they heard her screaming that her whole life was inside the home, the station said. Intense flames and heat pushed back firefighters searching for the trapped family members, Conte told reporters on Tuesday. The investigation into the fire continues, officials said. ""It's going to take a while,"" Conte said. ""That poor woman lost her entire family in one fell swoop."" Badger, a New York advertising executive, purchased the Connecticut home for $1.7 million in December 2010, according to property records. Johnson worked as a Santa at Saks Fifth Avenue's Manhattan store this holiday season, the department store said. He and his wife would have celebrated their 49th wedding anniversary on Monday, according to WFSB. Authorities said Tuesday it was unclear whether the home had working smoke detectors.

1540,"(CNN) -- Apple co-founder Steve Jobs died of respiratory arrest brought on by a pancreatic tumor, a public health official said Monday. Jobs died at 3 p.m. Wednesday at home in Palo Alto, California, said Amy Cornell of the Santa Clara County Public Health Department. His death was announced Wednesday by Apple, the Silicon Valley company he founded with Steve Wozniak. Jobs was 56. The hard-driving executive pioneered the concept of the personal computer and of navigating them by clicking onscreen images with a mouse. In more recent years, he introduced the iPod portable music player, the iPhone and the iPad tablet -- all of which changed how digital content was consumed. Jobs' death, while dreaded by Apple's legions of fans, was not unexpected. He had battled cancer for years, took a medical leave from Apple in January and stepped down as chief executive in August because he could ""no longer meet (his) duties and expectations."" On October 19, Apple employees will celebrate Jobs' life and contributions. A company memo from Apple CEO Tim Cook said: . ""Like many of you, I have experienced the saddest days of my lifetime and shed many tears during the past week. But I've found some comfort in the extraordinary number of tributes and condolences from people all over the world who were touched by Steve and his genius. And I've found comfort in both telling and listening to stories about Steve. ""Although many of our hearts are still heavy, we are planning a celebration of his life for Apple employees to take time to remember the incredible things Steve achieved in his life and the many ways he made our world a better place."" Jobs was buried Friday in Palo Alto. CNN's Dan Simon and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","NEW: Apple employees will celebrate Steve Jobs' life on Oct. 19 .

1542,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- A series of bomb and gun attacks targeting police stations, mosques and churches left 65 people dead in northeastern Nigeria, the Red Cross said Saturday. Attackers also left scores injured -- probably more than 100 -- in a three-hour rampage in the Yobe state city of Damaturu, according to Ibrahim Bulama of the Red Cross. Sixty-three people died. ""It is a very bad scene,"" he said. Gunmen first attacked the police headquarters and the anti-terror office before moving to churches and mosques, he said. Most of the casualties were police officers. In Potiskum, also located in Yobe state, gunmen attacked a book shop near the police station, killing two and injuring 5, the Red Cross said. The Friday attacks came the same day suicide bombers suspected to belong to a militant Islamist group targeted a military base in nearby Maiduguri. Three suicide bombers drove a stolen black SUV toward a Joint Task Force headquarters, but could not get through the gate, military spokesman Lt. Col. Hassan Mohammed said. The blast damaged roofs and walls of the base. Mohammed said two other simultaneous explosions took place at other military facilities. An unspecified number of Nigerian soldiers suffered injuries. Saturday evening, a suicide bomber launched another attack in Maiduguri, Mohammed said. No casualties were reported except for the bomber. He blamed the militant group Boko Haram for the attacks. Loosely translated, the group's name means ""Western education is sinful."" It wants to establish a state based on Sharia, or Islamic law, in northern Nigeria. The Red Cross official said Boko Haram is suspected in the Damaturu attack as well.","Gunmen attack a book shop in Potiskum, killing 2 .

1544,"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Severe flooding in Thailand on Saturday threatened central areas of Bangkok, a bustling capital barely above sea level and facing inundation at the next high tide predicted at 13 feet. Residents who decided to stay in their homes despite government pleas to get out waited anxiously to see whether high tide, forecast for Saturday afternoon, would overwhelm defenses along the Chao Phraya River and its many canals. Bangkok's outer suburbs were already submerged, but the central city had been largely spared the misery Thailand has been suffering for months in the nation's worst flooding since 1942. In the east and the north of the city, water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods, but in central Bangkok, it had been mostly dry. The city was facing two converging threats, however. Runoff the equivalent of 480,000 Olympic-size pools was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok, as high tide pushed the water in the opposite direction. ""The challenge is to manage the huge runoff from the north passing via the city on its way to the Gulf of Thailand,"" a Red Cross bulletin said. Saturday's high tide, the Red Cross said, was expected to put ""extreme pressure"" on Bangkok's elaborate system of dikes and other flood defenses. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered work crews Friday to cut channels in roadways to allow faster drainage, according to the state-run MCOT news agency. But the plan was rejected late in the day in favor of dredging canals and using pumps, the Bangkok Post reported. Health concerns were rising with the water. Bangkok residents waded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within, the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials. The government sent out crocodile hunters after reports of crocodiles and snakes in the filthy floodwater. ""We were hearing disturbing reports of dangerous animals such as snakes and crocodiles appearing in the floodwaters and every day we see children playing in the water, bathing or wading through it trying to make their way to dry ground,"" said Annie Bodmer-Roy, spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency Save the Children. As floodwater entered homes, some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave. Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was going to stay with relatives outside the city. ""Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded,"" said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it also was flooded. ""The water level is 2 meters (six feet) high and smells very bad,"" she said. The military had set up a flood relief center, ""but now even that has water coming in it,"" she said. Asked what help the government had provided, she said, ""We don't see that the government is doing anything much to help people, so better to help ourselves by getting out of Bangkok."" But the Bangkok Post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs, and would pick up residents of the capital on Saturday and take them out of Bangkok. As of Saturday, an estimated 1 million of the city's 12 million residents had left. Another Bangkok resident said she was worried about abandoning her house, which has been flooded for five days, and would not leave. Still, so many people had left that the streets were relatively quiet. Panic buying had led to a shortage of food and bottled water in the capital, residents said. City officials bracing for more flooding have opened nine evacuation centers. Officials urged tourists to steer clear of Bangkok, while noting that many of the other tourist spots, such as Phuket, remained dry and open for business. Thailand's Ministry of Public Health had transferred 280 of the capital's 520 patients in severe condition to 22 hospitals upcountry, the MCOT news agency reported. The remaining 240 patients will be taken to hospitals in other provinces by Sunday, it said, citing Permanent-Secretary for Health Paichit Varachit. Health Minister Witthaya Buranasiri said that, after months of flooding, 107,101 Thais have been diagnosed with stress, 6,214 with depression and 878 at risk of suicide. In all, 1,356 people were under observation by health officials, the minister said, according to MCOT. The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert on Thursday, recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas. It noted that most tourist destinations, such as Phuket and Chiang Mai, were unaffected. U.S. Ambassador Kristie Kenny said the crisis was slow-moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next. The United States has already provided civilian relief resources, including water pumps, water purifiers and life vests, she said, and two U.S. helicopters are helping the Thai military determine the extent of the flooding. The floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people, . Are you there? Share photos, video but stay safe . The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas. The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide, and more than 113,000 people have taken refuge in them. Overall damage from the floods could exceed $6 billion, the Thai Finance Ministry said. CNN's Sara Sidner and Kocha Olarn reported from Bangkok and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta.

1546,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Andre Rives no longer mows his own lawn and it's not because he's too busy. The thought of cutting his grass brings back some bad memories. ""Man, did this just happen to me?"" Andre Rives asked himself after losing three toes in a mowing accident. Rives, a 28-year-old cable technician from Ellenwood, Georgia, accidentally cut off three toes on his right foot two years ago while trying out his new riding mower. ""I was going too fast and my shorts got caught on the gear shift,"" Rives recalled. ""I came too close to the curb and I couldn't stop. I ended up sliding off and my foot went under."" Rives is one of 100,000 people in the United States in 2006 who suffered an injury in a lawn mower accident. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, which tracked the statistics, said the problem is more common than people think. The group reported most injuries occur among adults age 25 to 64, followed by children under the age of 5. More than 22 percent of injuries involved the wrist, hand or finger; nearly 14 percent involved the foot, ankle or toes. ""Most of the time it's a pure accident,"" said Dr. Marvin Royster with the Peachtree Orthopaedic Clinic in Atlanta, Georgia. ""They slipped on the lawn mower, the grass was wet or the lawn mower overturned."" Royster described some injuries, such as burns from touching the muffler, as mild. But other risks are greater; a mower can eject a piece of metal, rock or wood up to 100 mph, he said.  Health Minute: More on lawn mower risks » . In Rives' case, the accident resulted in the amputation of three toes. Royster repaired some of the damage in the operating room but was unable to re-attach the digits. He met with Rives recently for a follow up visit. ""Andre is doing very well,"" the doctor said. ""He has a little trouble with running and getting up on the ball of his foot, but other activities, he's able to do quite well."" The Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons noted that most lawn mower injuries are preventable if some basic safety guidelines are followed. ""The main thing is you need to wear protective clothing,"" Royster cautioned. Wear protective goggles, gloves, boots and long pants. Never mow barefoot or in sandals. ""Mowing the grass with flip-flops on or sandals on, you're just asking for trouble,"" Royster said. Have your lawn mower serviced before the start of the season to ensure it's working properly. Do not remove any safety devices on the machine. Be sure to add fuel before starting the engine, not when it's running or hot. The liquid could overflow or flame up. Finally, keep hands and feet away from the lawn mower blade even if the machine is turned off. Once cleared of an obstruction, a blade can swing around and cause injury. Rives realized immediately after his accident that he made a number of common sense mistakes. ""Even in the hospital, I'd say 'Man, did this just happen to me?' "" He said he's learned his lesson. His wife made him sell his riding mower after the accident. He pays professionals to mow his lawn twice a month. Rives said that in spite of having just two toes remaining on his right foot ""I am not having a pity party for myself.

1547,"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A bomb exploded Saturday at a private hospital in the tourist city of Agra, India, injuring three people. The bomb went off at Jai Hospital's reception area, said Brij Lal, spokesman for Uttar Pradesh police. The hospital is about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the famed Taj Mahal, India's most popular tourist destination. The blast blew out window panes and damaged the hospital's waiting room, where the three injured people were, said P.K. Tiwari, the inspector general of police in Agra. One of them sustain burn injuries. ""It is difficult to say what the cause and motive of the blast were. But we know that this was not a sophisticated device and seems to have not created too much impact,"" Tiwari said. ""My guess is this is a crude bomb."" Police at the scene said they spotted several unclaimed lunch boxes and bicycles near the blast site. India's Home Ministry said it had dispatched commandos to Agra and was in the process of collecting evidence from the scene. The Agra blast occurred a day after Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned the nation's senior police officers about India's vulnerability. ""The security environment in the country continues to be uncertain,"" Singh said in remarks at a police conference Friday. ""The recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai and Delhi are grim reminders of the grave challenges posed by terrorism to our national security."" India has suffered a spate of attacks in recent years, including the November 2008 siege of Mumbai that killed 163 people. This month, a bomb inside a briefcase at the high court in the capital, New Delhi, killed 11 people and injured 74 others. The Islamic extremist group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami claimed responsibility for that attack in an e-mail to several TV news channels. Authorities have detained three suspects from the Kashmir region. In July, 19 people were killed in three deadly blasts in Mumbai, India's largest city and financial hub. No one has been arrested yet. CNN's Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","NEW: Police say it was a crude device .

1550,"(CNN) -- Months after rescuers found them struggling and covered in oil, 33 endangered and threatened young sea turtles are finally going home to the Gulf of Mexico. Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the Audubon Nature Institute freed the turtles Thursday in waters about 40 miles southwest of Grand Isle, Louisiana. This marked the latest mass release of turtles since about 500 were rescued in the weeks and months after the massive months-long oil spill. ""We were able to release these turtles because they're now healthy, and we're seeing recovery in the surface habitats of the Gulf of Mexico,"" NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said in a news release. The spill began after an April 20 explosion on the offshore drilling platform Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 men. Two days later, the platform sank and oil started gushing into the Gulf. In early August, owner BP used cement and mud to plug the damaged Gulf of Mexico well. Officials formally declared an end to the oil spill disaster on September 19, though considerable efforts remained to clean up area waters and revive wildlife affected by the spill. Earlier this month, NOAA reopened federal waters off the Louisiana coast to fishing. Thursday's release marked another milestone in the area's recovery, according to those involved. ""Returning this group of sea turtles to their home waters is ... a sign that Louisiana is on the path towards recovery,"" said Randy Pausina, an assistant secretary for Louisiana's office of fisheries. The 33 turtles had been rescued more than three months ago by federal officials and state wildlife authorities from Louisiana, Florida and Georgia, as well as the Riverhead Foundation and the In-Water Research Group. They were rehabilitated at the Audubon Nature Institute in New Orleans. They included green, Kemp's ridley and hawksbill sea turtles, which are classified as endangered species. There also were loggerheads, which are a threatened species. With 270 turtles having been cleaned, nursed back to health and released, there are more than 200 still in rehabilitation sites around the area. Scientists did extensive aerial and shipboard tests earlier this week on the waters near the release point, making sure the sargassum algae was clean. Young turtles thrive in such areas, which provide protection from predators and ample food, including small crabs, snails and other creatures. ""Six months ago, it was nearly impossible to imagine this day would ever come,"" said Ron Forman, the Audubon Nature Institute's CEO and president.","The turtles were among 500 rescued after the mammoth months-long oil spill .
They are now healthy, and the habitat is recovering, scientist say .
Experts say the release is further evidence that the Gulf waters are recovering .",122 193 31 6280 126 73 1573 3 1334 4 2099 1521 6536 3 1538 239 1340 14896 28 766 128 102 2 0 3635 5 1991 1696 17 0 238 13919 3 9165 1070 0 5104 459 5 3845 3 16229 3 0 40806 1331 1872 4179 0 14896 409 4 2926 44 565 675 4695 5 1313 8206 5104 24 2642 0 579 1748 837 5 14896 105 44 739 37 3270 4 0 306 3 193 31 0 1142 24515 2099 8369 43 37 260 2 837 134 14896 82 30 192 70 1579 3 43 192 930 1756 4 0 2377 15259 5 0 3635 5 1991 18602 6433 3912 73276 21 4 1 221 837 0 8369 335 31 23 577 226 3513 8 0 8410 10198 3294 18842 7265 11 329 294 307 51 172 151 0 3294 7742 3 2099 287 16804 54 0 3635 4 279 552 1074 12006 158 9792 3 6490 2 8446 0 2061 3635 5 1991 124 324 4100 1656 23 196 2 0 2099 8369 2422 8 478 588 315 4587 937 1271 2 1805 39 314 2926 3 6740 3845 1364 15 0 8369 249 24 201 18602 7410 813 2926 99 0 5104 1241 2 4393 409 7 837 2642 119 7314 4 0 314 7 1756 120 2 118 418 1620 24 216 5 1340 14896 2 34 102 2926 10 1 845 11 5104 10 8 0 2047 842 1756 21 8952 523827 23 1468 776 6 5104 7 344 5 16229 0 1521 14896 32 29 3270 45 60 95 193 234 15 813 324 3 209 3845 401 17 5104 1287 3 2542 16 124 16 0 68748 1870 3 0 180712 721 216 30 37 22156 12 0 40806 1331 1872 4 68 6248 30 724 1121 18769 7 19891 3 112066 1340 14896 38 28 5223 16 6536 3487 48 41 37 25033 38 28 1 1538 3487 9 10443 14896 205 29 7857 20466 88 2 422 3 345 48 28 45 60 856 117 4 5262 1898 103 0 314 1696 116 2937 4811 3 54438 1590 249 24 131 8 0 2926 299 0 837 326 257 470 0 278398 20366 14 1805 239 14896 8895 4 132 815 38 717 1505 17 8775 3 12412 666 129 392 26403 31260 3 66 5425 243 193 234 13 14 471 2084 2 1986 24 108 52 302 160 21 5183 55401 0 40806 1331 1872 7 2209 3 263,bf4345dd3a5af1dce4e845655fad07958381a857,0.0
1551,"Miami (CNN) -- Tilikum, the killer whale that killed a SeaWorld trainer last year, has returned to the stage at the Orlando, Florida, theme park. Tilikum made his return appearance Wednesday morning in front of an audience in the ""Believe"" show. Trainer Dawn Brancheau was killed on February 24, 2010, when the killer whale -- commonly known as an orca -- grabbed her ponytail and pulled her under the water in front of horrified visitors. Brancheau died from ""multiple traumatic injuries and drowning,"" the Orange County Sheriff's office said at the time of the accident. Anthony Frogameni, Brancheau's nephew, said the family did not want to comment on Tilikum's return. ""From the start we've decided, it's a large family we all have our different opinions but we're just not going to talk about that aspect of it -- we're only going to focus on Dawn, "" Frogameni said. The Dawn Brancheau Foundation, which her family founded in her memory, says that the 40-year-old trainer's hair was especially long the day she was killed because she was growing it out to donate it to Locks of Love. The nonprofit organization provides hairpieces to disadvantaged children dealing with long-term hair loss due to medical treatment. SeaWorld had not answered written questions from CNN as of Wednesday evening, but did issue a statement saying Tilikum's participation in the shows was ""an important component of his physical, social and mental enrichment."" Since the accident last year, trainers no longer go into the water with any of the orcas at SeaWorld parks. In August, SeaWorld was fined $75,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for three safety violations, including one in connection with Brancheau's death. The agency's investigation ""revealed that SeaWorld trainers had an extensive history of unexpected and potentially dangerous incidents involving killer whales at its various facilities, including its location in Orlando,"" the OSHA statement said. On this day when Tilikum is the star of the show, Frogameni says, ""We want people to remember Dawn's life, not that tragic accident."" CNN's Dugald McConnell contributed to this report.","Tilikum makes his first appearance since killing a trainer in February 2010 .

1552,"Washington (CNN) -- The public may have seen the last video images of the failed blowout preventer from the BP oil well disaster, as authorities expressed possible security concerns. The feed from a camera on board a salvage ship was discontinued Saturday after the apparatus was raised from the sea floor and placed on the vessel Q4000. At his regular briefing with reporters Wednesday, National Incident Commander Thad Allen said additional questions about the unit would now have to go to the U.S. Justice Department and the Joint Investigation Team. When pressed about the video feed, Allen said, ""We'll have to refer that to the Department of Justice. There were some constraints put on that videotaping based on the people that are looking at the blowout preventer and their identities and so forth, and I think there's, there may be some security issues associated with it."" Allen said the ship will carry the unit to shore, but that the timetable and other questions will no longer be something he can address as part of the disaster operations that he heads. As of Wednesday, he said, ""the blowout preventer is already up on deck on the Q4000. The lower marine riser package has been separated, and they're putting it on latching skids getting ready to move it closer to shore."" He said ""exactly when it arrives and what the disposition would be, I would refer you to the Department of Justice, or the Joint Investigation Team,"" since ""from this point out it doesn't involve the spill itself."" Allen said after the ship moves off-scene, ""this will cease to be part of the national response that I'm coordinating as the national incident commander.""","The blowout preventer is on a ship in the Gulf of Mexico .

1553,"Washington (CNN) -- Workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon were pushing to complete the well at the heart of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill before the disaster, but no ""conscious decision"" to cut corners on safety has been discovered, a presidential commission reported Monday. ""There seemed to be a compulsion to get this rig completed in that April 19th-April 20th time period,"" said Bob Graham, the commission's co-chairman. ""And as a result of that, a number of things which might have made the outcome of this plight different were deferred or abandoned."" The undersea gusher erupted with an April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig, which was completing a well for the oil giant BP at the time of the blast. The rig sank two days later, taking 11 men to a watery grave and unleashing the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The well was about 45 days behind schedule, and Fred Bartlit, the commission's chief counsel, said BP's operating costs for the leased rig were running about $1.5 million per day. Those costs were ""overhanging the heads of people on the rigs,"" Bartlit said -- ""but they don't want their buddies to get killed, or themselves."" ""To date, we have not seen a single instance where a human being made a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety,"" he said. But as the commission opened two days of new hearings into the disaster on Monday, Graham questioned why the timing was ""so central"" to managers that they did not examine the well's cementing job more closely. ""I would hope that tomorrow we get down to the question of just what was driving for a decision on that particular narrow 24 hours,"" added Graham, a former U.S. senator and Florida governor. In its preliminary findings, the commission criticized BP for shifting its plans for capping the completed well. At one point, one of the ""company men"" on the doomed rig was unaware of changes being planned back on shore, staff attorney Sean Grimsley said. Mark Bly, BP's executive vice president for safety, told the commission he and the company ""don't exactly agree"" with the findings. ""In our work we went through what turned out to be the eight critical things we thought had contributed causally here,"" he said. ""We clearly identified the failure to isolate at the bottom of the well and the negative test and, subsequently, the monitoring, so we didn't see the procedures here as particular to that. We felt they were covered in the other things that we described."" Rep. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, an outspoken critic of BP, said the company has ""a long and sordid history of cutting costs and pushing the limits in search of higher profits."" ""When the culture of a company favors risk-taking and cutting corners above other concerns, systemic failures like this oil spill disaster result without direct decisions being made or tradeoffs being considered,"" Markey said in a written statement on Monday's findings. The Massachusetts Democrat leads the House Energy and Commerce committee's energy and environmental subcommittee. Still pending are test results on the rig's blowout preventer, the massive fail-safe device that was supposed to shut down the well in case emergency. Federal authorities took control of the preventer in September and have turned it over to a Norwegian engineering firm to analyze the device ""from soup to nuts,"" Bartlit said. BP, rig owner Transocean and cement contractor Halliburton have pointed fingers at each other since the rig sank. As the well's owner, BP was responsible for capping the ruptured well and cleaning up the more than 200 million gallons of oil that spilled. The well was sealed temporarily in mid-July and capped permanently on September 19. Lab test results should have prompted managers to redesign the cement slurry used to line the well, the committee reported. In addition, the Transocean drill crew also could have diverted the escaping hydrocarbons overboard or triggered the rig's emergency disconnect before the blast, which could have shut in the well and ""limited the impact of any explosion and/or the blowout,"" the commission stated. Managers for both BP and Transocean treated a pressure test as a ""complete success"" despite repeated signs showing that the cement job was not containing the high-pressure oil and gas, the commission found. Co-chairman William Reilly, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the evidence so far indicates a ""culture of complacency"" on the part of both industry and regulators, including the since-disbanded Minerals Management Service. ""If we had not been complacent, I suppose the most obvious reality is we would not have experienced two full months of a gushing well leading to 200 million gallons being spilled,"" Reilly said. ""We would not have seen Congress underfund the regulatory agency consistently over the better part of the last 20 years, and the consequent failure of MMS to rise to the challenges posed by technologies that simply became so sophisticated that they scarcely were any match for the people they were regulating."" The commission's final report is due January 11. Investigations are also under way by the Justice Department, several congressional committees and a joint Coast Guard-Interior Department board. Unlike those agencies, however, the presidential commission does not have the power to subpoena witnesses -- an issue Bartlit raised several times. ""We get a lot of arguments,"" he told Graham at one point. ""This is where subpoena power, senator, would be helpful, because it's going to be hard to resolve those unless I can sit people down in a room in a very professional, gentlemanly way and cross examine them and find out, you know, what's believable and what's not believable.""

1554,"(CNN) -- Forty-three soldiers suffered heat-related illnesses Friday during a 12-mile road march at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, an Army spokesman said. The march was the culmination of a week of ""expert field medical badge training,"" during which soldiers are tested on their medic and general soldier skills in order to receive an ""expert"" badge, Fort Bragg spokesman Benjamin Abel said. Sixty soldiers were on the march, which started at 6 a.m., and they were carrying backpacks, helmets, weapons and other combat gear, Abel said. About an hour and a half into the march, the people running the event noticed some personnel ""were having difficulties,"" and medical transports were begun, he said. Eighteen of the soldiers were transported to Womack Army Medical Center, and one was admitted to the intensive care unit, he said. Humidity levels Friday morning were higher than expected, but ""this is odd, out of the norm, to have this many people treated,"" Abel added. The expert field medical badge is deemed by the Army as ""the utmost challenge to the professional competence and physical endurance of the soldier medic,"" Fort Bragg officials said in a statement earlier this week. ""It is the most sought-after peacetime award in the Army Medical Department, and while the combat medical badge is the 'portrait of courage' in wartime, the expert field medical badge is undoubtedly the 'portrait of excellence' in the Army all of the time,"" officials said. ""To wear the EFMB means you passed a grueling series of hands-on-tests on communications, common skill tasks, emergency medical treatment, evacuation of the sick and wounded, litter obstacle course, day/night land navigation courses, comprehensive written test, 12-mile foot march, CPR, physical fitness test, and weapons qualification,"" the base said. In June 1965, the Department of the Army established the badge as a special skill award for the recognition of exceptional competence and outstanding performance by field medical personnel.","A total of 60 soldiers were being tested for their expert field medical badge .

1555,"Ercis, Turkey (CNN) -- The death toll from the massive earthquake that shook eastern Turkey over the weekend rose to 570 on Friday, up from 535 the day before, but crews have pulled 187 people alive from the rubble, Turkish officials said. In addition, about 2,555 people were injured by the 7.2-magnitude earthquake that struck Sunday, according to the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Relief Agency. Rescue workers extracted 13-year-old Serhat Tokay from the rubble of an apartment building early Friday, 108 hours after the earthquake struck Ercis, the semi-official Anatolian news agency reported. The child was being treated in a field hospital. Eight hours earlier, crews had rescued 18-year-old Imdat Padak from the wreckage of another building in Ercis, the agency reported. After teams from Azerbaijan retrieved him, Padak was taken to a hospital for initial treatment, and then was airlifted by helicopter to the city of Van. Padak appeared not to have any significant trauma, but was suffering dehydration. He is reported to be a student from the village of Kiziloren and was taking courses while preparing for university entrance exams. Earlier in the week, crews pulled a 2-week-old baby, Azra Karaduman, alive from the debris. There were reports Thursday of a moderate earthquake in the country's south. A 5.2 earthquake hit about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the center of Sunday's quake, near the border with Iraq, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Tokay was the latest of several people found alive in the rubble days after Sunday's quake. On Wednesday, rescuers pulled two people from collapsed buildings. Britain has pledged emergency tents for more than 5,500 people whose homes were destroyed, Home Secretary Theresa May said during a visit to Turkey Thursday.

1556,"(Health.com) -- Over the past several years, researchers have noticed an odd pattern in the relationship between body weight and Alzheimer's disease: Middle-aged people have a higher long-term risk of developing the disease if they're overweight or obese, while older people have a lower risk of the disease if they're carrying excess weight. A new study, published this week in the journal Neurology, may offer a clue to this so-called obesity paradox. Non-overweight individuals in their late 60s, 70s, and early 80s who have no outward symptoms of Alzheimer's are more likely than their heavier peers to have biological markers (or biomarkers) of the disease, the study found. This finding raises the possibility that weight loss or a low body mass index (BMI) later in life may be an early warning sign of mental decline, the researchers say. ""Weight changes or body composition changes may actually be a manifestation of disease, which would explain the obesity being an apparent protective factor,"" says Jeffrey M. Burns, M.D., the lead author of the study and the associate director of the University of Kansas Alzheimer's Disease Center, in Kansas City. Health.com: 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . Well before memory loss and other symptoms appear, Alzheimer's may trigger metabolism changes that promote weight loss, Burns says. ""In general, we think of Alzheimer's as a brain disease, but this is evidence that there are systemic problems throughout the body in the early stages of Alzheimer's."" Burns and his colleagues analyzed data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, a huge study spanning 58 hospitals and universities that's funded by the National Institutes of Health and an array of nonprofit organizations and drug companies. The goal of the initiative is to find ways to measure the progression of Alzheimer's and the precursor condition known as mild cognitive impairment. The researchers looked at 101 people who underwent brain scans designed to identify the plaques and abnormal tangle of proteins that are the hallmark of Alzheimer's, and another 405 people whose cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed for fragments of these proteins (beta-amyloid peptide and tau). Each group included some people with Alzheimer's disease, some with mild cognitive impairment, and some with no signs of mental deterioration. Health.com: 7 ways to protect your memory . There was no connection between BMI and Alzheimer's biomarkers in the patients who actually had Alzheimer's. But in the other two groups, lower BMI was associated with higher levels of biomarkers and a higher likelihood of having brain plaques and tangles. Among people with mild cognitive impairment, for instance, 85 percent of non-overweight individuals had signs of these brain abnormalities, compared to just 48 percent of those who were overweight or obese. (A BMI of 25 or above is considered overweight.) Richard Lipton, M.D., an attending neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center, in New York City, who was not involved in the new research, agrees with the authors that the findings suggest that Alzheimer's can affect the entire body early on. ""The most obvious manifestations of Alzheimer's disease are in the brain, but Alzheimer's disease has a large number of effects on the body as well,"" says Lipton, the principal investigator of a long-running study on aging and Alzheimer's. ""The brain regulates blood pressure and respiratory rate and pulse and hunger and satiety and blood flow to various organs in the body, so it wouldn't be surprising if a widespread disease of the brain had effects on many, many different aspects of bodily function."" Health.com: Aging workforce means dementia on the job could rise . The study shows only an association, not cause and effect, so Burns and his colleagues can't be sure that Alzheimer's directly causes weight loss (or prevents weight gain). In fact, the researchers found no association between BMI changes and Alzheimer's biomarkers in a subset of study participants whose weight was tracked for two years. May Ahmad Baydoun, Ph.D., a staff scientist at the National Institute on Aging who studies risk factors for dementia, described the study as ""very strong"" overall. But, she says, ""the results would have been a lot stronger if they found weight loss over time is associated with increased Alzheimer's disease pathology, also over time."" The relationship between weight loss and the progression of Alzheimer's is likely a two-way street, Lipton says. People who start to experience declines in mental function may shop for groceries less regularly, cook less frequently, and eat less -- and the poor nutrition that results could in turn accelerate the progression of the disease, he says.

1557,"(CNN) -- The bodies of three men have been found in shallow graves in eastern Ohio, all of them believed to have been killed after answering a Craigslist ad to work on a cattle farm, according to authorities. The Summit County medical examiner's office on Saturday identified one of the victims as Timothy Kern of Massillon, Ohio. The 47-year-old's death, caused by ""gunshot wounds to the head,"" was ruled a homicide, the office said in an audio recording. A phone call led police Friday to Kern's body in a shallow grave behind an Akron mall, authorities said. Multiple law enforcement authorities, including FBI officials, have tied Kern's death to a wider investigation into the two other killings. In his last Facebook posting, dated November 10, Kern wrote: ""Just got one of the strangest job offers. A good offer but strange. The job is to watch over 680 acres south of cambridge. Odd jobs and such but mainly just secure it. Trailer, utilities, salary. Drawbacks? No cell phone service, kids are up here, and i have to move this Sunday."" Meanwhile, the body of a ""white male"" was also discovered Friday ""in a shallow grave in Stock Township,"" about 120 miles south of Akron, Noble County Sheriff Stephen Hannum said in a statement. The sheriff did not respond to calls Saturday from CNN. But Hannum said earlier this month that there are ""two suspects in custody"" in the case. Michael Rafferty told CNN affiliate WJW that his 16-year-old son Brogan Rafferty of Stowe is among them, charged with attempted murder. The father claimed that his son had been ""manipulated"" and ""corrupted,"" insisting that his son is a ""mild-mannered gentleman."" The other suspect in the case -- 52-year-old Richard Beasley of Akron, as identified on a Summit County court website -- is being held on unrelated charges. No attorney was listed for Beasley in the court document. The investigation began the night of November 6, when a Noble County deputy sheriff responded to a call and came upon a ""white, middle-aged man being treated for a gunshot wound to the right arm,"" according to Hannum. The shooting victim, who is from South Carolina and was not identified by police, told the sheriff he had answered an ad on the Craigslist website offering work caring for cattle on a 688-acre property. WJW: Body of missing Massillon man identified . He met with the two suspects and drove with them toward Stock Township. After being told a road was closed due to a landslide, the South Carolina man got out of the car to start walking toward the property, which he was told was nearby. He told the sheriff that, while walking through a heavily wooded area, he then turned around ""to see a gun pointed at his head. He deflected the gun and ran"" -- getting shot in the arm while fleeing, according to the sheriff. The victim hid for seven hours in the forest before going to a house and requesting help, Hannum said. Then, on November 11, the sheriff received a call from a Boston, Massachusetts, woman who said her twin brother had not been seen since October 22 in Parkersburg, West Virginia. The brother had also answered a Craigslist ad ""and she felt very sure it was the same advertisement (the shooting victim from South Carolina) had answered."" On November 15, authorities -- including agents from the FBI and Ohio's Bureau of Criminal Investigation, plus ""cadaver-sniffing"" dogs -- found ""the body of a white male buried in a shallow grave"" near where the first man had been shot, Hannum said. Police have not identified the body. The sheriff tied that man's death to the investigation of the shooting that left the South Carolina man wounded in the arm. Multiple authorities since then have also linked the two bodies discovered Friday -- including that of Kern -- with the same investigation. Zach Kern, 19, told CNN that he last saw his father November 12 after he'd gone with another son for the job interview. ""He was all stoked about it,"" Zach Kern said of his father's feelings about the opportunity to work on the cattle farm. ""My brother ... thought the whole situation was sketchy."" Timothy Kern ended up going to the would-be job site alone, not with the 17-year-old son who'd accompanied him to the interview, Zach Kern said. The same son added that his father, divorced and with three children, worked ""odd jobs"" including recently as a street cleaner in Canton. He said that his father saw his children daily, adding that the whole family is struggling to come to grips with his death. ""We're just trying to get through this,"" Zach Kern said Saturday.","One man told police he was shot after answering a Craigslist ad for an Ohio job .

1558,"(CNN) -- The cat that vanished in baggage claim at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and whose plight became an online sensation has been found after being missing for two months. ""American Airlines is happy to announce that Jack the Cat has been found safe and well at JFK airport,"" the carrier wrote in a post on the ""Jack the Cat is Lost in AA Baggage at JFK"" Facebook page Tuesday evening. ""Jack was found in the customs room and was immediately taken by team members to a local veterinarian. The vet has advised that Jack is doing well at present."" The airline plans to fly the cat to California to be reunited with his owner, Karen Pascoe. The saga started on August 25, when Pascoe was flying from New York to San Francisco with Jack and a second cat as part of a job relocation. But Jack escaped his kennel and was last seen at JFK's inbound baggage claim. (A Department of Transportation Pet Incident Report released earlier this month explains how it happened: A clerk placed one kennel on top of another on a baggage cart and the kennel on top fell. The impact ""caused the kennel to separate,"" allowing the cat to escape.) When a search failed to turn up Jack after a few days, Pascoe became frustrated with American Airlines and started the Facebook page ""to help us put pressure on AA to step up their efforts."" She also urged fliers to ""do whatever they can do to keep their animals out of cargo."" The page now has more than 16,000 followers. In its post, the airline said the search efforts included ""many employees at the airport who have remained vigilant in their search and committed to finding Jack."" While the cat was missing, workers placed food and water around the airport and set up humane traps. American even hired a pet detective and issued a pet Amber alert in hopes of locating the feline. We ""share everyone's relief that he has been found,"" the carrier said.","American Airlines says it has found Jack the Cat after two months of searching .

1559,"Ercis, Turkey (CNN) -- Nearly three days after a massive earthquake shook eastern Turkey, rescuers pulled two more survivors from collapsed buildings Wednesday. The quake and its aftermath killed at least 471 people and injured at least 1,650 others, the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Relief Agency said in a statement on its website. In the latest rescue, emergency crews pulled a 27-year-old teacher from debris 67 hours after the quake hit, the Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported. The teacher, Gozde Bahar, had difficulty breathing and was taken to a hospital for treatment. Eyup Erdem, 18, was pulled from a collapsed building where he had been trapped for almost 61 hours and was taken to a field hospital, the semi-official Anatolian news agency reported. No more information was immediately available on either of the rescues, which occurred in the town of Ercis in the province of Van. They came a day after crews pulled a baby, her mother and her grandmother alive from the rubble. The father of 2-week-old Azra Karaduman remained trapped beneath the rubble, officials said. Crews pulled four bodies from the debris after her rescue, but did not say whether they included the infant's father. Working in temperatures in the 40s (single digits Celsius), teams of rescuers have scoured the ruins for survivors since Sunday's 7.2-magnitude earthquake. In the town of Guvecli near the Syrian border, the last of the funerals were held Wednesday for the 15 people who died in the town of approximately 2,000 residents. Eighty percent of the 200 buildings were destroyed in the quake and the others were rendered uninhabitable, officials said. Residents were spending the nights crowded into tents, which were in short supply. Residents said aid was arriving sporadically. In Ankara, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed that the eastern province would be rebuilt. He said 16 planes carrying search-and-rescue teams arrived in the region during the first two days after the earthquake and that 3,755 public personnel, 422 nongovernmental organization workers, 595 search-and-rescue vehicles and 860 health teams had been sent to the affected area. Turkey said Tuesday that it would accept international aid, citing a need for tents and prefabricated houses for ""the reconstruction phase"" that will begin after the search-and-rescue efforts, Anadolu said. Japan's embassy was the first to respond, promising to send about $400,000, Anadolu said. Japan suffered an earthquake and tsunami in March that killed thousands and triggered a nuclear crisis. Britain, Germany, France, Jordan, Qatar, Switzerland, Israel, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and the United States have also said they could help with reconstruction, the news agency said. Israel's Ministry of Defense said a plane carrying seven prefabricated buildings and other aid was to depart Wednesday for the stricken region. At least 2,262 buildings were demolished in Van and surrounding villages and towns, the news agency said. Relations between the two countries have been tense since last year's Israeli commando raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla laden with humanitarian aid. Nine Turkish activists were killed. Turkey has suffered other major earthquakes in recent years. A magnitude-7.6 earthquake in Izmit killed more than 17,000 people in 1999, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A magnitude-7.2 tremor in Duzce the same year killed 894 people, the agency reported. CNN's Diana Magnay contributed to this story .","A woman, 27, and a man, 18, are pulled from the debris .

1560,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A series of deadly bombings claimed more than a dozen lives in Iraq Saturday, according to police and health officials. Seven people were killed and 28 others wounded when three roadside bombs exploded mid-morning in the busy Bab al-Sharji commercial district of central Baghdad, police officials said. Another six men died and 10 others were injured when a roadside bomb hit a minibus carrying young laborers and construction workers in al-Annaz area in eastern Falluja, health and police officials said. The blast occurred at about 5.30 a.m. local time in what is a predominately Sunni area. ""The victims were traveling every day in a minibus from Abu Ghraib to Falluja to work in a number of reconstruction sites,"" police officer Ahmed Salman told CNN. Meanwhile, the Iraqi army held a military parade in Falluja, sending hundreds of Iraqi soldiers accompanied by military vehicles through the main streets of the town Saturday morning, police told CNN. The military parade was part of preparations for the Iraqi army to take over full responsibility for security after U.S. troops leave Iraq on December 31 this year. Violence in Iraq has declined from its peak, but attacks around the country continue to cause deaths and injury. On Thursday, 19 people were killed and dozens others were hurt when three explosions hit a commercial district in Basra, an oil-rich, predominantly Shiite city about 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of Baghdad.","Three roadside bombs went off in a commercial district of Baghdad, police said .

1561,"(CNN) -- Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad was stung by a sea creature for a second time Saturday night and was being treated by doctors, her team said in a blog post, leaving the continuation of her swim in question. The 62-year-old, in transit from Havana to Florida, was stung by some kind of presumed jellyfish, the blog said. ""Her face and eyes and the area around her eyes are affected. She is out of the water and aboard the transom of the Voyager where she is being treated by doctors. It will be up to Diana to decide whether or not to continue to the swim."" The incident was another setback for the athlete, who was stung by Portuguese man o' war earlier in the day. At 6:30 p.m., Nyad was 49 miles from Havana. Having passed the 24-hour mark, she was entering a critical time in her quest to cover the 103 miles. ""Tonight, her second night in the open water, may be the most critical,"" the team wrote. ""Steve Munatones, the independent observer for the International Swim Federation who is accompanying the expedition, says that swimmers have a much better chance of success if they can make it through the second night."" There was a bit of excitement early Saturday afternoon. An oceanic whitetip shark swam near Nyad, but a diver on her team faced it off and it meandered away. The swimmer improved her performance late Saturday morning after struggling to maintain her usual stroke rate, her support team said. Fortified by chicken soup, Nyad was making good progress until the Saturday evening incident. ""This afternoon -- it is stunning to actually witness -- Diana is swimming stronger and stronger,"" one post said. ""Her strokes are up to 50 per minute, she is eating pasta, gobbling bananas, bits of peanut butter sandwiches, along with high-carb & high calorie liquid concoctions."" The going was rough before dawn Saturday, when Nyad had stopped her freestyle stroke and complained that she couldn't breathe properly after getting stung. Doctors from the University of Miami gave the swimmer a shot to reduce inflammation, oxygen and other medication, the blog said, and after treading water for an hour Nyad said she felt better. Candace Hogan, a friend who has been on most of Nyad's swims since 1978, said she could recover and complete the 100-plus mile marathon, the blog said. The team initially said Nyad had likely been stung by a moon jellyfish but revised that to say it was the more troublesome Portuguese man o' war. A National Institutes of Health report says an encounter with a Portuguese man o' war can lead to ""significant systemic reactions"" but rarely death. While mild stings generally produce localized pain, severe ones can provoke symptoms ranging from headaches to seizures, delirium, coma and paralysis, as well as breathing problems, cramping and vomiting, the NIH says. Chief handler Bonnie Stoll said on Twitter that Nyad had been ""stung along both arms the side of her body and her face."" Nyad had to clear herself of tentacles, change her swimsuit and put on a shirt for protection after the incident. Another member of Nyad's support team said the way she handled the setback was a ""testament to her strength."" ""It was scary,"" Stoll said. ""But Diana is happy that this happened early while she is still at her strongest."" A safety diver who entered the water to help Nyad was also stung numerous times, her blog said. He received treatment back on one of the flotilla of boats accompanying her. Nyad began her swim just after 6 p.m. Friday from Havana's Hemingway Marina. The former world champion swimmer expects the swim to take close to 60 hours, which would put her into Florida sometime Monday. Nyad last attempted this swim in early August and had to be pulled from the water after some 60 miles, and almost 29 hours of swimming. She blamed a shoulder injury she suffered early in the journey, and an 11-hour-long asthma attack. Her first Cuba-Florida attempt, back in 1978, was brought to an end by strong currents and bad weather after almost 42 hours in the water, according to her website. CNN's Matt Sloane and Shasta Darlington contributed to this report.","NEW: She is deciding whether she can continue the swim .

1562,"(CNN) -- The motorsport community was in mourning on Monday as competitors from across various racing disciplines paid tribute to Marco Simoncelli, the Italian MotoGP rider who lost his life after a crash in Malaysia on Sunday. Simoncelli, 24, sustained critical injuries when he was struck by compatriot Valentino Rossi and American Colin Edwards after losing control of his Honda bike and sliding across Turn 11 of the Sepang Circuit. Rossi, a seven-time MotoGP world champion, used the @ValeYellow46 Twitter account to pay tribute to Simoncelli, who he described as ""a younger brother."" ""Sic [Simoncelli's nickname] for me was like a youngest brother. So strong on track and so sweet in the normal life. I will miss him a lot,"" read the Tweet. Simoncelli killed in Malaysia crash . Honda president and CEO Takanobu Ito praised Simoncelli's commitment and personality, while expressing the team's gratitude for the results he achieved during two seasons with the Japanese outfit. ""Marco Simoncelli was a passionate rider bubbling over with a challenging spirit and blessed with a cheerful personality,"" Ito said on Honda's official website. ""With a promising future on the Grand Prix circuit, Marco had both genuine ability and a large following among racing fans. ""We are very thankful for his sterling results riding for Honda Racing Corporation as a factory rider. We express our heartfelt condolences to Marco's family."" Last year's title winner Jorge Lorenzo missed the race due to surgery on his finger, but the Yamaha rider also paid tribute to Simoncelli -- who was sixth in the 2011 MotoGP standings at the time of his death. ""I don't know what to say on a day like today,"" Lorenzo said via his official Twitter account. ""Only that you will be missed - rest in peace Marco."" Another former world champion to pay his respects to the Cattolica-born star was 2006 winner and current Ducati rider Nicky Hayden. ""Sometimes life just don't make sense,"" said the American. ""RIP #58 you were a star on & off track we all going to miss you."" Spaniard Jorge Martinez is a former rider and current owner of the Aspar Racing Team. The 49-year-old expressed his sadness, while also stating there was nothing Rossi or Edwards could have done to avoid the collision. ""Marco lost the front end and attempted to save the crash, but unfortunately the inertia of the bike took him onto the inside of the corner just when Edwards and Valentino were passing,"" Martinez told the sport's official website. ""There was nothing that they could do to avoid him. Today is a tremendously sad day for the entire paddock and for those who love motorcycle racing."" Outside of MotoGP, drivers from other motorsport disciplines also passed on their condolences to Simoncelli's family and friends. ""My thoughts are with his family, friends and team at this extremely sad time. Another tragic loss at such an early age,"" Tweeted 2008 Formula One world champion and McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton's teammate and 2009 champion Jenson Button also used Twitter to pass on his sympathies. ""R.I.P Marco ... Such an exciting talent lost. My thoughts are with his family, friends and everyone involved in MotoGP,"" said the British driver, before later adding, ""Sometimes motorsport can be so cruel."" Simoncelli's death came a week after British IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon lost his life during a fatal multi-car crash at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. The president and CEO of the venue Jeff Belskus praised Simoncelli as a racer who was loved among motorsport fans. ""We are deeply saddened at the passing of Marco Simoncelli,"" said Belskus in a statement. ""He was one of the most charismatic figures in the world championship and had a fantastic future ahead of him in MotoGP. ""Marco was one of the most popular riders at the MotoGP event at Indianapolis, as his talent on the motorcycle and his ability to connect with fans both were very special. We extend our sincere sympathies to his family, team and fans.""","The motorsport community is in mourning after death of Marco Simoncelli .

1563,"(CNN) -- An 11th person has died because of injuries sustained in the crash Friday at an air race at Reno, Nevada, an official with the Washoe County Medical Examiner's Office said Tuesday. No details about this latest victim were released. The official, Michelle Anderson, said there would be a news conference revealing more information late Tuesday. Authorities have so far identified seven people who died from the crash. The list includes the pilot, 74-year-old Jimmy Leeward, who lost control of his vintage plane before it plummeted into a crowd of spectators. He and six others were killed on the tarmac, while four have now died at hospitals. The six others identified are Joseph Wogan, 22, of Arizona; George and Wendy Hewitt of Washington state; Regina Bynum, 53, of Texas; Sharon Stewart, 47, of Nevada; and Gregory Morcom, 47, from Washington state. Almost 70 people were injured in the crash. Five patients remained hospitalized Tuesday at Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center, four in serious condition and one in fair condition, the hospital said in a statement. Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board announced Sunday that the World War II-era plane was equipped with data and video recording devices that they hope to use to help determine what happened and why. NTSB member Mark Rosekind described the devices, as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices, as ""significant new information."" It was also not entirely expected, given the relatively small size and nature of the P-51 aircraft. ""I'm not aware of a lot of aircraft having it; this is the first one I came across,"" said Howard Plagens, the NTSB official heading the investigation. Plagens was referring to a ""box"" that recorded key variables such as altitude, latitude and oil pressure. In addition, there was an outward-facing video camera on the plane, according to Rosekind. Several memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device and will be sent to the NTSB laboratory in Washington for a full analysis, Rosekind said. They may belong to some of the 200,000 spectators who were at the annual National Championship Air Races and Air Show. Investigators do have a copy of the ""box"" data, since it was sent in real time by telemetry to sources outside the aircraft. Besides the cards, Rosekind said, parts of a plane's tail, an ""elevator trim tab"" and video camera fragments have been found. ""There were thousands of pieces of debris,"" Plagens said, explaining how the site had been laid out in a grid system to help organize the investigation. As with the memory cards, one of the authorities' first goals will be to determine whether these came from the plane. Countering earlier reports, Rosekind said Sunday that Leeward did not send a ""Mayday call,"" indicating he was in distress. Investigators have repeatedly stated that it is not known why the aircraft nosedived. Some speculation has surrounded the elevator trim tab, which was breaking apart prior to the crash, a photograph shows. Investigators also will pore over ""a tremendous (amount of) video that was captured"" at the scene, according to Rosekind. A preliminary report will be available Friday, but Rosekind has said the full investigation could take six to nine months. ""It's not just what happened, it's why it happened,"" he said Sunday. ""(We're) trying to make sure this doesn't happen again.""","NEW: Five people remain hospitalized, four in serious condition .

1564,"(CNN) -- Rina was almost a Category 3 hurricane as it careened near Honduras and Belize Wednesday before heading towards Cancun. The storm was packing 110 mph winds early Wednesday morning and moving at 3 mph, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. That is 1 mph away from a Category 3 hurricane. Forecast models show Rina strengthening into a Category 3 hurricane before approaching the Yucatan. The projected path shows Rina back at Category 2 intensity when it takes aim at Cancun on Thursday. Residents and worried travelers in Cancun stocked up on supplies Tuesday to prepare for the storm to hit the popular Mexican resort city. Carla Bautista bought bread, water and canned tuna. ""It's my first hurricane. This is new. ... I'm a little afraid, because I don't know what to expect,"" said Bautista, 28, who moved to Cancun two months ago from Mexico City. Mexican officials issued a hurricane warning for the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from north of Punta Gruesa to Cancun as the Category 2 storm strengthened. Similarly, U.S. officials issued a travel alert, advising U.S. citizens in the area to prepare themselves for the possibility of a hurricane. Some tourists decided not to take any chances. ""We wanted to get out of there. ... We were on vacation and just didn't want to be stressed,"" said Kathy Davis, 57, an American with a timeshare in Cancun. She said she and her husband celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary at the airport while waiting to catch a flight. In Cancun's hotel area, crews were securing boats and clearing palm fronds and debris. Kelly McLaughlin moved her 6-year-old son's toys inside and trimmed tree branches around her home. ""I'm just checking everything to make sure there's nothing loose,"" said McLaughlin, a Canadian who's lived in Cancun for eight years. McLaughlin, 40, said preparing for storms has become routine since Hurricane Wilma devastated the area in 2005. ""My friends that are fairly new to Cancun are a lot more nervous and starting to get a little stressed,"" she said. ""I'm just trying to keep everyone calm."" Lines at supermarkets and gas stations were long, residents said. As of 2 a.m. ET Wednesday, the center of Rina was about 240 miles east-southeast of Chetumal, Mexico, and 250 miles southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. It was moving west at 3 mph, but was expected to gradually turn northwest and speed up over the next two days, forecasters said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoiche and journalist Brisa Munoz of CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","Rina is just shy of being a Category 3 hurricane .

A roommate last saw Uekman playing video games about an hour earlier, ""and he appeared to be in good health,"" the university said. An autopsy will be performed. ""The cause of Uekman's death is not known at this time, but there are no suspicious circumstances,"" the statement said. Uekman, of Little Rock, ""was living his dream of going to the U of A and playing football for the Razorbacks,"" parents Danny and Michelle Uekman said in a statement released through the school.

1566,"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A nearly 9-hour flight delay turned into a standoff at Hong Kong airport Wednesday, with passengers refusing to leave the plane for 5-hours until the airline agreed to higher compensation. The incident underscores just how high tensions can rise in modern air travel with passengers and airlines jockeying it out in a low-frill, high-fee world. There is no global standard for passenger compensation in the case of airline delays and wide gulf can exist between passenger expectations and airline offers. When Hong Kong Airlines flight 752 from Singapore arrived at 530 a.m. Wednesday morning, the airline says 80 passengers refused to get off. The travelers, mainly members of package tours from mainland China, demanded the airline increase the original compensation offer of $50 per passenger. Twenty-one of the passengers stayed on board for another five hours, requesting reimbursement for the unused hotel rooms they had paid for the night before. The airport police were called in to negotiate and the passengers finally at 10:25 a.m., after the airline agreed to pay them $150. Hong Kong's I-Cable News quoted one passenger who said it wasn't the money, but the attitude of the airline that irked them. This isn't the first such incident in Hong Kong. The Standard newspaper reported in February that a group of Mainland tourists staged an all-night protest in the airport over flight delays. Hong Kong Airlines spokesperson Eva Chan blamed the incident on cultural differences. ""Our air staff never had any bad attitude towards the passenger,"" she said. ""They tried to negotiate and explain that the compensation policy of HK airlines is different from mainland Chinese airlines."" The irate travelers would likely have been better off if they had been traveling within the European Union. The EU requires passengers be compensated between $330 and $800 if their flight is delayed by two hours or more, depending on the flight length. However, the airline can claim exclusion for ""extraordinary circumstances,"" including weather and security incidences. The United States has no federal regulation on delay compensation, but it has instituted regulations that penalize airlines if passengers are stuck in a plane on the tarmac for more than three hours. The Department Transportation just fined an American Airlines' subsidiary $900,000, in the first penalty since the regulations went into effect last year.","A nearly 9-hour flight delay turned into a standoff at Hong Kong airport Wednesday .

1567,"Ercis, Turkey (CNN) -- The death toll from the massive earthquake that shook eastern Turkey over the weekend rose to 535 Thursday, up from 471 the day before, but crews have been able to rescue 185 people alive from the rubble, Turkish officials said. In addition, about 2,300 people were injured by the 7.2-magnitude earthquake that struck Sunday, according to the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Relief Agency. Meanwhile, crews rescued 18-year-old Imdat Padak alive from the rubble of an apartment building in Ercis almost 100 hours after the earthquake, the semi-official Anatolian new agency reported. After teams from Azerbaijan retrieved him, Padak was taken to a hospital for initial treatment, and then was airlifted by helicopter to Van. Padak appeared not to have any significant trauma, but was suffering dehydration. He is reported to be a student from the village of Kiziloren and was taking courses while preparing for university entrance exams. Earlier in the week, crews pulled a 2-week-old baby, Azra Karaduman, alive from the debris. The developments came as there were reports of a moderate earthquake in the country's south. A 5.2 earthquake hit about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the center of Sunday's quake, near the border with Iraq, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. There were no immediate reports of damage from the latest quake. Padak was the latest of several people found alive in the rubble days after Sunday's quake. On Wednesday rescuers pulled two people from collapsed buildings. Britain has pledged emergency tents for more than 5,500 people whose homes were destroyed, Home Secretary Theresa May said during a visit to Turkey Thursday.

1568,"(CNN) -- The number of deaths linked to cantaloupes contaminated with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria has risen to 28, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday. A total of 133 people in 26 states have been infected, according to the CDC. Additionally, a woman who was pregnant at the time of her illness had a miscarriage. Although health officials have said it is too early to declare the outbreak over, the number of new cases is falling. ""The peak in illnesses appears to have occurred from late August until the middle of September,"" Dr. Barbara Mahon of the CDC said last week, adding that additional monitoring will be needed for at least another two weeks. The grower, Jensen Farms of Granada, Colorado, issued a voluntary recall of its Rocky Ford brand cantaloupes on September 14. The tainted cantaloupes should be off store shelves, the CDC has said. Unsanitary conditions at the Colorado cantaloupe farm's packing facility are a possible contributing cause of one of the nation's worst outbreaks of listeria contamination in food, health officials have said. The listeria outbreak is the deadliest food-borne illness outbreak in the United States since 1998. Groups at high risk for listeria include older adults, people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women. Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms should be disposed of immediately, even if some of them have been partially eaten, the agency recommended. If consumers are uncertain about the source of a cantaloupe, they are urged to ask their supermarket. If the source remains unknown, the fruit should be thrown out. Refrigerating a cantaloupe will not kill the bacteria, which can grow at low temperatures, and consumers should not try to wash off the bacteria.","At least 133 cases have been reported in 26 states .

1569,"(CNN) -- An investigation is under way into a previously unrevealed incident last week in which two jetliners nearly collided over Hong Kong, aviation authorities said Tuesday. The September 18 incident reportedly did not come to light publicly until an article revealing it was published Tuesday in the English-language newspaper The Standard of Hong Kong. The two jets, carrying more than 600 passengers and crew members, came within seconds of colliding, the newspaper reported, citing a former Hong Kong aviation official. According to a statement issued by Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department, a Cathay Pacific Airways flight that was bound for Hong Kong International Airport came within 1 nautical mile (2 km) of a Dragonair A330 airplane that was in a holding pattern for landing. The international standard for separation between aircraft is 5 nautical miles (9.26 kilometers) horizontally or 1,000 feet (304) meters vertically), the department said. The incident happened during a stormy afternoon when aircraft were stacked up for landing over Hong Kong, the department said. An air traffic controller was trying to shuffle waiting aircraft around so that the Cathay Pacific flight, which was low on fuel, could land more quickly. That's when controllers noticed the flights were too close. The pilots of both aircraft failed to respond to commands to change course at one point or another during the incident, the department said. Collision avoidance systems on both aircraft activated after the crew of the Cathay Pacific flight failed to respond to a command to climb to a higher altitude. Cathay Pacific said in a statement that ""both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair pilots had taken appropriate actions under the circumstances to re-establish standard separation between the two aircraft."" The pilots could see each other's planes during the incident and there was no risk of collision, the department and Cathay Pacific said. But The Standard quoted Hong Kong's former civil aviation chief Albert Lam Kwong-yu as saying that, based on normal speeds of the airliners involved, they were about six seconds from colliding. ""The chance of a crash is absolutely high,"" the paper quoted Lam as saying. ""The passengers really came back from hell."" The flights involved were Cathay 841 from New York to Hong Kong, and Dragonair 433 from Kaoshiung, Taiwan, to Hong Kong. The Cathay jet had 317 people aboard and the Dragonair jet had 296 aboard, according to aviation officials. Investigators have ruled out air traffic controller fatigue as a cause of the near-collision, the department said. The air controller in charge of the flights was appropriately rested and has since returned to work, the agency said. Investigators will examine air traffic procedures, staffing levels and flight crew operations, the department said. Hong Kong has been the site of four other near-collision incidents in the last 11 years. -- In September 2010, a Cathay Pacific plane taking off for London after midnight had to deviate from the runway center line at high speed because the tail of another plane was too close to its path. -- In July 2006, a Dragonair Airbus and a Northwest Airlines Boeing -- both heading for Tokyo -- were reported to be just 100 meters apart vertically while 80 nautical miles east of the Hong Kong airport. -- In September 2004, a China Southern Airlines plane leaving Hong Kong and an incoming Malaysia Airlines cargo plane came within 304 meters of each other 55 nautical miles south of the airport. -- In June 2001, a Dragonair Airbus to Shanghai and a Cathay Pacific flight arriving from Seoul were reported 210 meters apart 110 nautical miles east of Hong Kong.","An investigation is under way into a near-collision last week over Hong Kong .

1570,"(CNN) -- With more than 5 million people suffering from Alzheimer's disease in the United States, a number that's expected to rise to 16 million by 2050, the pressure is on to find better methods of diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Around the world, Alzheimer's disease is the second most feared disease, behind cancer, according to a recent survey of five countries conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health. Yet there is still a lot of misinformation: Only 61% of Americans who responded to the survey correctly identified Alzheimer's disease as a fatal illness. Many participants also mistakenly believe there are sure diagnostic methods and effective treatments to slow the disease, but most would seek medical attention if they became aware of their own early signs. The research that came out of the Alzheimer's Association 2011 International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease, which took place in Paris last week, reflects a growing emphasis on early detection. Research suggests the best targets for exploring treatments are patients who do not have full-blown Alzheimer's disease, but experience mild symptoms. Scientists have identified biological indicators called biomarkers that seem to be associated with Alzheimer's, although they are not perfect predictors. Alzheimer's Association: 10 signs of Alzheimer's . ""Things are heading earlier and earlier. And the use of biomarkers has been really essential for helping everybody move toward an understanding of what the earliest changes are and when they can be detected,"" said Dr. Allan Levey, chair of neurology at Emory University School of Medicine. Early detection . So far, no drug has been developed to significantly slow the progression of the disease in all patients. And there's no way to halt or reverse the decline of memory and other cognitive abilities once Alzheimer's has been diagnosed. Since attempts to help patients who already have symptoms in these ways have failed, scientists must look to the earliest stages of Alzheimer's in hopes of stopping it before it begins. Studies presented at the conference reinforced the notion that signs of Alzheimer's may develop in the brain 10 to 20 years before any symptoms begin. A substance in the brain called beta-amyloid has been associated with dementia in people who have those kinds of symptoms. This is the main ingredient of plaques that build up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. People with a rare genetic form of Alzheimer's, whose specific genetic mutations guarantee that they will develop the disease, tended to show signs of amyloid plaques in PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid 10 to 20 years before the onset of symptoms. These results come from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network project. But that represents only a small fraction of Alzheimer's patients -- 1% of cases worldwide, specifically. If you don't have the genetic form, there's no way to tell if you will go on to develop the disease, even if you have accumulation of amyloid plaques. There are some people who have them but do not show symptoms of Alzheimer's. The kinds of tests that would detect beta-amyloid levels are not widely available. And it's not clear that pulling the amyloid plaques out of the brain reverses the process of cognitive decline; this is one area of research right now. Another biomarker of interest is a protein called tau, implicated in the neurofibrillary tangles -- which basically take the shape of cells and destroy them -- that build up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, particularly in the memory center called the hippocampus. But there's no scan to detect these tangles in a living patient. A major focus of research on early detection is patients who have mild cognitive impairment, a collection of symptoms involving difficulty with memory, language and other mental functions, but which does not interfere with everyday life. It is not necessarily a precursor to Alzheimer's disease, but it does raise the risk of progressing into that more severe illness. Understanding mild cognitive impairment is important in coming up with better treatments for dementia in general, because the brain hasn't deteriorated as much as in Alzheimer's, so it may not be too late to intervene, experts say. The brain is the primary organ the disease attacks, but a small study presented at the conference suggests the eyes may also reveal signs of Alzheimer's. Researchers looked at photos of retinal blood vessels and found some differences in Alzheimer's patients, but further research is needed to confirm this idea of using an eye exam to help diagnose Alzheimer's. The same holds for a study suggesting that falling is indicative of Alzheimer's early stages: It's a preliminary idea that needs further investigation. Identifying risk and prevention factors . Another area of focus is identifying risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. These are associations, not known direct causes. ""Age is a risk factor we can't modify, at least yet. Our genetics, we can't modify yet, which is another major risk factor,"" Levey said. ""But certainly seeking clues about ones that are modifiable is an important"" research area. At the Paris conference, researchers said 3 million cases of Alzheimer's could be prevented worldwide if lifestyle-based, chronic disease risk factors were reduced by 25%. This estimate is based on a mathematical model. In the United States, physical inactivity had the biggest association with Alzheimer's out of the risk factors studied, followed by depression and smoking. Midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, low educational attainment and diabetes are other risk factors. ""If we can demonstrate that these risk factors can be modified, and that it will lead to lower rates of Alzheimer's disease, the impact could be huge,"" Levey said. People in their 40s and 50s have still got perhaps a couple of decades to modify lifestyle to potentially lower risk, he said. There is also growing evidence that head trauma may increase the risk of dementia. One study presented at the conference in Paris found that traumatic brain injury was associated with dementia among older veterans. A study of former NFL players suggests that football players also may be at increased risk for mild cognitive impairment or similar cognitive decline, perhaps as a result of repeated head injury during these former athletes' sports careers. In fact, 75 former professional football players are suing the NFL, alleging that the league concealed information about the harmful effects of concussions on the brain for decades. There is also the idea of cognitive reserve: that keeping the mind active can at least delay the onset of dementia. It also seems that intelligence might help the brain stay in the mild phase of the disease longer, although more study needs to be done in this area as well. ""We know that highly intelligent people have more tolerance to plaque buildup and to loss of energy in their brains than people with lower levels of intelligence and less education,"" said Dr. Steven DeKosky, vice president and dean of the University of Virginia's School of Medicine, at an Alzheimer's forum at the National Press Foundation in May. ""Their brain basically fights it off and finds some other ways to get the things done."" Caregiving . One of the underappreciated effects of Alzheimer's disease is how great a toll it takes on caregivers. Caregivers are much more frequently ill and die earlier than people who do not care for someone with the disease, studies have shown. The stress of taking care of someone chronically ill is sometimes called caregiver syndrome. Caregiving is hazardous to health because of the stress of helping Alzheimer's patients, and because caregivers may ignore their own health, DeKosky said. ""Alzheimer's patients, when they get into moderate and severe stages, don't have some real sense of time,"" DeKosky said. ""They have to be watched every minute."" Patients may hurt themselves or wander off if not under constant supervision. And it's common for patients to reverse their sleeping and waking cycles, so caregivers' daily habits are likewise disrupted. The cost is staggering: Caregivers provide more than $200 billion in unpaid care, 17 billion hours each year, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Gibbons' advice to Alzheimer's caregivers: Breathe, believe and receive . Why don't we know more? Two of the biggest obstacles to finding treatments for Alzheimer's disease are lack of money and difficulty enrolling people in clinical trials, experts say. The United States spends $450 million each year in Alzheimer's research money, compared to $6 billion for cancer, $4 billion for heart disease and $3 billion for HIV/AIDS research. In spite of the money that does exist for research, Alzheimer's clinical trials are hard to fill with participants, said Dr. R. Scott Turner, director of the Georgetown University Memory Disorders Program. Sometimes people believe they're just having ""senior moments"" and don't want to acknowledge their illness, Turner said. In other cases, patients don't want to go through the hassle of the trial if they're not guaranteed to receive an experimental drug; but, in order for a scientific study to be valid, patients must be randomly assigned to either the drug or a placebo. Also, some trials don't test drugs at all, but simply look for those biomarkers that may help predict disease later or explore other early diagnostic methods. Such methods will be in high demand when an effective treatment is developed, DeKosky said. ""When the first drug is successful, let's say in symptomatic disease -- may it be so -- the crush to take advantage of what we know, while it's still in research format now, will be immense,"" DeKosky said.

1571,"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Doctors completed an autopsy of Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday, with the chief pathologist confirming the former Libyan leader died of a gunshot wound to the head. Dr. Othman el-Zentani would not disclose whether findings revealed if Gadhafi suffered the wound in crossfire or at close-range -- a key question that has prompted the United Nations and international human rights groups to call for an investigation into the final moments of the late Libyan strongman's life. Doctors performed the autopsy at a Misrata hospital in the presence of officials from the prosecutor's office, Zentani said. Autopsies were also conducted on the bodies of Gadhafi's son, Mutassim, and his former defense minister, Abu Baker Yunis. No foreign or independent officials were present, Zentani said. The autopsy report will go to the attorney general's office before it is released to the public, he said. Meanwhile, the three bodies would likely return to a cold storage unit at a Misrata meat market for public viewing, Zentani said. Long lines of people turned up all weekend long to view the corpses. Gadhafi's family issued a statement Friday calling on the United Nations and Amnesty International to push Libya's new leadership ""to hand over the bodies of the martyrs of their tribe so they can be buried according to Islamic rites,"" a pro-Gadhafi TV station reported. Gadhafi's death Thursday solidified the power of the National Transitional Council, which marked the country's liberation on Sunday in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the uprising started. But uncertainty was still swirling Sunday about the death of the Libyan leader, who Libyan and world powers wanted to capture and prosecute for war crimes. Leaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday. But others have questioned that account. Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's emergencies director, told CNN that fighting had ended when Gadhafi was cornered in a drainage ditch. He said crowds beat Gadhafi in what was a ""humiliating end"" for the former dictator. ""When he left the area, he was very much alive,"" Bouckaert said. ""There's no reason why he should have been subjected to this kind of mob justice."" An amateur video distributed by the Reuters news agency Sunday showed NTC fighters congratulating a man the fighters say killed Gadhafi. CNN could not independently verify that claim. The video, purportedly recorded near an ambulance carrying Gadhafi's body, shows a jubilant group of fighters pouring water on a man's head. ""He is the one who killed him,"" one man says, pointing. ""He killed him in front of me, I swear to God,"" another man chimes in. A lawyer for Gadhafi's son Saadi, who fled in September to Niger, issued a statement Sunday saying, ""Saadi Gadhafi is shocked and outraged by the vicious brutality which accompanied the murders of his father and brother."" ""The contradictory statements issued by the NTC excusing these barbaric executions and the grotesque abuse of the corpses make it clear that no person affiliated with the former regime will receive a fair trial in Libya nor will they receive justice for crimes committed against them,"" the statement said. Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the NTC's executive board, has said Gadhafi's right arm was wounded when a gunbattle erupted between the fighters and Gadhafi loyalists as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle. More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was shot in the head, dying moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner. The United Nations human rights office and activist groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have called for a probe into Gadhafi's death. The United States supports those investigation requests, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""As Libyans move into the future once again, they need to do so with a sense of unity and reconciliation. They need to hold each other accountable. Those who do not have blood on their hands must be made to feel safe and included, regardless of whether or not they supported Gadhafi in the past,"" she said. ""So we believe in the rule of law, and accountability, and such an investigation would contribute to that."" U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva on Friday that there were ""at least two cell-phone videos, one showing (Gadhafi) alive and one showing him dead."" ""Taken together, these videos are very disturbing,"" he said. ""We believe there is a need for an investigation and more details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture.","NEW: Gadhafi's son Saadi is ""outraged"" over circumstances surrounding his death .

1572,"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- High tide on Friday sent some water pouring into the Bangkok's Chinatown area, but it receded within a few hours, while the commercial district remained largely dry. Those who have stayed in the city despite the government's pleas to leave are waiting to see if the highest tide, forecast to come Saturday afternoon, will overwhelm defenses along the city's river and many canals and bring more damaging floods. Floodwaters that drenched much of central and lower parts of northern Thailand crept Thursday into Bangkok, stressing embankments and flooding roads, parking lots, factories and markets and sending many residents fleeing for dry ground. Up to 1 meter (3.2 feet) of water was expected in some areas, said Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, as the Chao Phraya River spilled into the city of 12 million people. Several districts were under a mandatory evacuation order. ""There is water from underground coming up,"" said Pracha Promnok, chief of the Flood Relief Operations Center. ""We are unable to do anything (to stop it)."" Yingluck fielded criticism that the flood relief center had not done enough and -- with tears in her eyes -- called on the public to sympathize with emergency staff, as some of them had also become victims of the flooding. ""Many are exhausted and some problems cannot be controlled and were not caused by (the center),"" Yingluck said, according to MCOT. Thailand's government declared public holidays through the rest of the month in 21 flood-affected provinces, and appealed to Bangkok residents to head to the countryside. People flocked to bus terminals and crowded the Suvarnabhumi Airport, the main airport, in hopes of reaching higher ground. The smaller domestic airport, its runways inundated, was closed until November 1, but Suvarnabhumi was operating normally, protected by 3.5 meters (almost 12 feet) of dikes, said Toopetch Booyarith of the Airport Authority of Thailand. ""We are confident that we will not be affected,"" Toopetch said. CNNGo: Updated info for tourists . The streets of the normally bustling metropolis that is notorious for massive traffic jams stood empty Thursday, save for a few public buses and taxis that were able to navigate through. There was even water standing before the Grand Palace, perhaps the most adored of Bangkok's landmarks. In some neighborhoods vacated by people, domestic animals were left to fend for themselves. ""You'll see dogs stranded on rooftops, dogs trying to swim,"" said Marcelo Cacciola, of the Soi Dog Foundation. ""So we went to these little towns around the Bangkok area with boats and rescued the dogs."" Some hotels slashed prices to accommodate the flood-affected and some tourist areas reported full occupancies. In the resort town of Pattaya, fleeing Bangkok residents found it hard to get a room in hotels overflowing with European tourists, the Bangkok Post reported. Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was planning to leave Bangkok to stay with relatives outside the city. ""Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded,"" said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it, too, was flooded. ""The water level is two meters (six feet) high and smells very bad,"" she said. She said the military had set up a flood relief center, ""but now even that has water coming in it."" UNICEF said it was providing $300,000 in aid that includes 20,000 insecticide-treated mosquito nets. The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas. It noted that most tourist destinations, such as Phuket and Chiang Mai, were unaffected. U.S. Ambassador Kristie Kenny said the crisis was slow-moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next. The United States has already provided civilian relief resources, including water pumps, water purifiers and life vests, she said, and two U.S. helicopters are helping the Thai military determine the extent of the flooding. The floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people, authorities said. Are you there? Share photos, video but stay safe . The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas. The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide, and more than 113,000 people have taken refuge in them. Overall damage from the floods could exceed $6 billion, the Thai Finance Ministry said. CNN's Sara Sidner, Aliza Kassim and Elizabeth Yuan contributed to this report.

1573,"(CNN) -- Former college and pro football star Charles Aaron ""Bubba"" Smith, who went on to an acting career after his retirement from sports, was found dead at his home, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office said Wednesday. He was 66. Police and fire officials were called to Smith's home after ""he was found unresponsive"" and pronounced him dead, said Ed Winter, assistant chief of operations and investigation for the coroner. An autopsy will be performed to determine cause of death, Winter said. However, asked if there was any reason to believe the death was due to anything other than natural causes, he replied, ""Not at this time."" An imposing 6 foot 8 and 260 pounds, Smith was considered one of the most fearsome pass rushers of his day. The No. 1 overall pick in the 1967 National Football League draft, he played nine seasons in the NFL -- for the Baltimore Colts, Oakland Raiders and Houston Oilers. Sports Illustrated gallery: The NFL goes Hollywood . He played for the Colts in two Super Bowls and was also a two-time Pro Bowl pick. Smith was one of the anchors of an overwhelming defense that was heavily favored to win Super Bowl III. Nonetheless, the New York Jets, led by Joe Namath, defeated the Colts in the 1969 championship of pro football, widely considered one of the biggest upsets in U.S. sports history. The Colts atoned for that embarrassment -- somewhat -- two years later in a 16-13 victory over the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V, but Smith reportedly said he was so dismayed by the game's sloppiness that he never wore his Super Bowl ring. Smith was sidelined by a severe knee injury during an exhibition game in 1972, and the next season joined the Raiders. He told Sports Illustrated in 1973 that ""not playing was terrible. I didn't want to show my face in public. I don't know if it was that we were losing or what, but it almost drove me crazy."" After retiring from pro football in 1975, Smith landed small roles on TV series such as ""Good Times,"" ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Semi-Tough,"" according to IMDb, before landing his signature role as Lt. Moses Hightower in the first ""Police Academy"" movie in 1984. He reprised the role in all six movies in the popular comedy franchise. Smith was a two-time All-America defensive end at Michigan State University. He played in what the national media dubbed ""the game of the century"" between Michigan State and Notre Dame in 1966, a 10-10 tie that resulted in the two teams' splitting the vote for that year's national championship. Smith was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988, an event he called ""the jewel in my crown, for my collegiate days were very special to me."" Smith was born on February 28, 1945, in Beaumont Texas. His father was a high school football coach and his mother had earned two college degrees. According to his member biography on the College Football Hall of Fame website, he said he took his parents with him when he went to speak to youth groups ""to demonstrate my respect for them.""","Charles Aaron ""Bubba"" Smith, 66, was found dead in his L.A. home .

1574,"(CNN) -- The 32-year-old Texas man who died in a shark attack over the weekend while scuba diving off Western Australia was remembered Sunday by his sisters as ""unique"" and ""one of a kind."" Sharon Wainwright of Panama City, Florida, identified the victim as her son, George Thomas Wainwright. His sisters, Brenda Wainwright and Wanda Brannon, spoke to CNN affiliate WMBB-TV. ""It's devastating. It's hard to even wrap your head around. I can't believe he's gone. I think it was just wrong place, wrong time because he was very wise. I would trust him with anything to do with being on the water,"" said Brenda Wainwright. She described her brother as ""unique ... that rare combination of incredibly intelligent, very kind, great sense of humor."" Police said Saturday the man was scuba diving with two friends near Rottnest Island, a popular tourist destination about 15 miles off the Australian mainland, when the attack occurred. The man's friends, who were not in the water at the time, noticed an abnormal amount of air bubbles rising to the surface in the area where he was diving, followed by a plume of blood, said police spokesman Michael Wear. Moments later, the man's body rose to the surface. Police said he succumbed to his injuries not long after the incident. Following a preliminary review of bite marks on the body, authorities said he is believed to have been killed by a great white shark. ""He was in the water by himself, I believe,"" Sgt. Greg True of Western Australia police told CNN affiliate Channel Nine. ""There's been some pretty massive injuries inflicted."" Sharon Wainwright told CNN her family was notified of the incident Saturday morning. Authorities said the man had been living in Western Australia. Wainright's relatives expect his body to arrive in Florida in about four days, Sharon Wainwright said. Saturday's attack was the second fatal shark attack in the past two weeks near the city of Perth, capital of the state of Western Australia. ""He was one of a kind,"" the victim's sister, Brannon, told WMBB. ""He's more than just a quick news spot. He was our brother and we loved him. He will be missed.""

1575,"(CNN) -- An international footballer who played for the United Arab Emirates, and who became an internet sensation after scoring a backheeled penalty, has died following a car accident near the country's capital, Abu Dhabi. Theyab Awana, a 21-year-old winger for local club Bani Yas, was one of the country's brightest prospects after winning the 2008 AFC Under 18 Cup and was instrumental in the UAE reaching the quarterfinals of the 2009 FIFA Under 20 World Cup. ""Theyab Awana has passed away on Sunday night after a horrible traffic accident on Sheikh Zayed Road in Abu Dhabi,"" the UAE Football Association confirmed in a statement on Monday. ""God blesses his soul and wholehearted condolences to his family, friends and fans."" Last year he won a silver medal at the 2010 Asian Games after the UAE reached the final and had been picked for both senior and Olympic national teams. But it was his actions during a friendly against Lebanon in July that brought him international recognition. With the UAE leading 5-2, Awana stepped up to take a penalty. Instead of conventionally striking the ball he twisted around and backheeled the ball into the corner of the net. He was immediately substituted by then coach Srecko Katanec, who was angry at what he saw was a lack of respect for the opposition. Yet the fans didn't agree. Instead the YouTube clip of his penalty went viral. More than 1.2 million people have since viewed it. ""On behalf of AFC and the Asian football family, I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the UAE football community, family and friends of Awana,"" the Asian Football Confederation's acting president Zhang Jilong said in a statement. Awana's death comes soon after another young Emirati player Saeed al Nooby, who played for second division side Al Dhafra, also died in a car accident. ""We had just returned last night with the club officials and players after visiting the family of Saeed al Nooby and paying our condolences,"" Bani Yas' Brazilian coach Jorvan Vieira told the Dubai-based newspaper the Gulf News. ""An hour later I got a call from the club's manager informing me of the accident and I rushed to the hospital but Awana had died. ""It will take some time for the club and his teammates to get over Awana's death. We have lost a man, a player and a boy and it will be hard to replace him.""","UAE international footballer Theyab Awana killed in a car accident .

1577,"London (CNN) -- Singer Amy Winehouse's death this summer was the result of alcohol poisoning, an inquest ruled Wednesday, as it reached a verdict of ""death by misadventure."" A pathologist told a coroner's court in north London that alcohol toxicity was the cause of the 27-year-old's death, with her blood-alcohol levels measured at more than five times the legal limit for driving. The Grammy award-winning artist, who had battled with alcohol and drug abuse over several years, was found dead at her north London home July 23. Testimony at her inquest showed no traces of illegal drugs in Winehouse's system -- but more details emerged about her losing battle with alcohol. Winehouse's physician, Dr. Christina Romete, said she saw Winehouse at 7 p.m. the day before she died, when the singer was tipsy but still able to hold a conversation. Asked when she was going to stop drinking, Winehouse replied that she would call Romete over the weekend to discuss it, the physician said. Winehouse was determined to do things her own way, including therapy, Romete said, but was aware of the risks of alcohol abuse. The singer's personal security guard, Andrew Morris, said he last spoke to her at 2 a.m. on July 23. He said he looked in on her at 10 a.m. and saw her lying on her bed, but figured she was sleeping in, which wasn't unusual, the court heard. Morris said he realized something was wrong when he checked in again at 3 p.m. and saw Winehouse had not moved. She wasn't breathing and had no pulse, he said. Morris said the singer didn't ""drink to get drunk,"" but that he noticed she had started drinking alcohol again that week. Police who searched the flat after her death found three empty vodka bottles, the inquest heard. The pathologist's tests revealed that Winehouse's blood-alcohol level was 416 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood. The level considered lethal is 350 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood, and the legal limit to drive in Britain is 80 milligrams of alcohol. The pathologist found no traces of tablets in Winehouse's stomach and said her organs appeared to be normal. The verdict of misadventure means that it is judged to be an accidental death in which no law was broken or criminal negligence involved. A family statement, given by spokesman Chris Goodman, said: ""It is (with) some relief we finally found out what happened to Amy. ""We understand there was alcohol in her system when she passed away. It is likely a buildup of alcohol in her system over a number of days. ""The court heard that Amy was battling hard to conquer her problems with alcohol and it is a source of great pain that she could not win in time. She had started drinking again that week after a period of abstinence,"" Goodman said. Winehouse's father Mitch and mother Janet were among those who packed the small courtroom at St. Pancras Coroners Court to hear the evidence from key witnesses. Her family set up the Amy Winehouse Foundation last month to raise money to help young people in Britain and elsewhere, especially those suffering the effects of ill health, disability, poverty and addiction. Goodman said the ruling ""underlines how important our work with the Amy Winehouse Foundation is to us to help as many young people and children we can in her name."" Winehouse's family said in August that toxicology tests had found that ""no illegal substances"" were in her system at the time of her death but alcohol was present. The singer's soulful, throaty vocals brought her stardom in 2007, but her troubled off-stage life -- chronicled in her top 10 hit ""Rehab"" -- won her notoriety. Her death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks after she was booed offstage by disappointed fans in Serbia. The tattooed London-born singer-songwriter's first album, ""Frank,"" debuted in 2003, when she was 19. International success came with her 2007 album ""Back to Black."" She dominated the 2008 Grammys, winning five awards that night and delivering, via satellite from London, a strong performance of ""Rehab."" Mitch Winehouse has said he plans to write a memoir, called ""Amy: My Daughter,"" to be released next summer, which he said would tell the story of the Amy that the public never got to know.","Three empty vodka bottles were found in Winehouse's home, the inquest hears .

1578,"(CNN) -- An explosion caused by a chemical reaction at a University of Maryland-College Park chemistry lab caused minor injuries to two students and forced authorities to evacuate the four-story building, according to the Prince George's Fire Department. Initial reports described an explosion and fire inside the building, but fire department spokesman Mark Brady said in a post to the department's Twitter account that there was no fire. The department's hazardous materials team was preparing to go into the building, he said. Two students were being treated at the scene for first-degree chemical burns and superficial cuts, Brady said on the social networking service.","Chemical reaction injures two University of Maryland-College park students .

1579,"Cairo (CNN) -- A pipeline that supplies gas from Egypt to Israel exploded Monday in the northern Sinai Peninsula near Bir el-Adb, an Egyptian security official said. The explosion appears to be an act of sabotage, said Gen. Saleh al-Masri, the head of security in Egypt's northern Sinai Peninsula. ""It is an act of sabotage, but the army and members of Egyptian Natural Gas Company are on the scene trying to understand what happened,"" al-Masri said. The explosion has shut off the flow of gas to Israel and Jordan, said Ayman Jahin, a general manager at the gas company. It is the third such attack on Egyptian pipeline infrastructure since the toppling of Hosni Mubarak's government earlier in the year. The first two attacks resulted in a halt in the flow of gas to Israel, which receives about 40% of its natural gas from Egypt. The army cordoned off the area around the explosion, asking onlookers to return home,"" Mohamed Sabry, a freelance journalist at the scene, told CNN. He said flames could be seen shooting into the sky hours after the explosion. Firefighters were working to contain the fire, he said. Delivery of Egyptian gas to Israel came to a halt after an April attack on a pipeline in the Sinai Peninsula. The flow of gas through the pipeline to Israel was restored in early June. In February, a gas pipeline in El Arish that sent natural gas to Jordan was set on fire, shutting off the flow of gas to not only Israel but but Syria, Jordan and Lebanon as well. The issue of gas sales to Israel has become highly controversial in Egypt with various allegations circulating that Israel received below market prices for the gas and that Egyptian government officials enriched themselves on the deal. The Israeli government and Israeli investors in the pipeline have categorically denied below market pricing for the gas and last month one of the major investors released a statement expressing public frustration that the Egyptian government was not moving more quickly to get the gas flowing again and threatened to pursue legal action. The pipeline between Egypt and Israel became operational in 2008 and the arrangement represents one of the major economic agreements between the two countries. CNN's Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","Flow of gas to Israel and Jordan from Egypt has been shut off .

1580,"(Parenting.com) -- When your toddler is hurt and screaming and emotions are bubbling over, it can be hard to tell if a situation is a true emergency, something that can be treated in your doctor's office or an issue you can handle at home. ""It's always better to call the pediatrician before going to the ER for anything but life-threatening emergencies,"" says Lara Zibners M.D., a pediatric ER doctor and author of ""If Your Kid Eats This Book, Everything Will Still Be Okay."" We spoke to pediatric ER doctors about the most common accidents and whether your child's doctor will deal with the issue over the phone, have you come into the office or call the ER to alert them that your child is on the way. What if your baby pulls up on the coffee table and then yanks a mug of hot tea on herself? Head to the ER if the burn covers a large part of her body; if it's on her face, hands, feet or genitals; or if it's a third-degree burn, which is pretty unlikely from a hot beverage. Otherwise, treat her at home and act fast. Since the first thing to do is get the hot liquid off the body, Dr. Zibners recommends removing the wet clothing and plunking her into a cool shower. ""If it's only a small part of the hand or arm that's been burned,"" she says, ""running cool water over the limb in the sink for 10 to 15 minutes or until the pain subsides will stop further injury and provide immediate pain relief."" Keep the area in water until it's cool to the touch, then treat the burn. At-home burn basics . If she has a first-degree burn (the skin is red), follow these tips: . DO: After the burn has cooled, cover it loosely with a dry bandage or clean cloth. DON'T: Apply ointments (or butter). This could cause infection or trap heat and make the burn deeper. Do not break any blisters. This could allow bacteria into the wound. What if your toddler topples off his changing table? The goose egg is huge, and he's hysterical. Head to the ER? For kids older than 12 months, you can take a watch-and-wait approach. Dr. Zibners says most kids who bump their heads are fine, and the size of the bump rarely has anything to do with the extent of the injury. There are loads of blood vessels in the head and face, so the swelling can be dramatic. Keep an eye on him for the next few hours to make sure he doesn't limp or favor one arm, vomit or become unusually sleepy or especially irritable. If you see any of these signs, call the doctor as they could mean something more serious. And, of course, if your child is motionless or unconscious or refuses to move after his fall, call an ambulance right away. The exception: Dr. Zibners says any child under a year of age who experiences more than a minor bump should always be checked out by a physician because injuries are harder to detect when the patient can't talk. Parenting.com: How to decode that strange rash . Diaper duty . The American Academy of Pediatrics offers these guidelines for safe diaper changing: . - Choose a changing pad with a concave middle to keep baby in place. - Always buckle the safety strap. - Keep diapering supplies within your reach (but out of baby's). What if another kid bites your baby and the skin is broken? Call your pediatrician right away. She may decide to send you to the ER, depending on the location of the bite and its appearance. (She might prescribe an oral antibiotic.) Otherwise, wash the wound immediately and thoroughly with soap and warm water and then apply an antibiotic ointment and bandage. ""Human bites are among the dirtiest of all wounds due to bacteria normally found in the human mouth,"" says Karen Frush M.D., a pediatric emergency room doctor and chief patient safety officer at Duke University Health System in Durham, North Carolina. ""Thoroughly washing the skin with soap and water is the best thing a parent can do to effectively reduce the bacteria load found in the wound."" Parenting.com: How gross is it? Your germiest situations analyzed . What if someone sideswipes your car? Your child is strapped into his safety seat, but he's upset and crying. Head to the ER? Only if he doesn't calm down after a reasonable amount of time, say 15 or 20 minutes. ""With children age 5 and under who are properly restrained in an age-appropriate car seat, the likelihood of injury is small in a non-or low-impact situation,"" says Dr. Frush. But if your child won't stop crying, bring him to the emergency room. ""That may mean he was subjected to unusual force, and a doctor can figure out if there are any injuries,"" she adds. Generally, though, if your child is moving his arms and legs, the best thing to do is remove him from his car seat, try to calm him and make sure he's OK. Warning signs . Sometimes symptoms take a few hours to appear. Call the doctor if you notice these signs: . - Blood in his urine (which could be a result of injury to the upper or lower urinary tract). - Bruising over his chest or belly from the straps. - Refusing to move or turn his head. - Refusing to bear weight. What if your toddler falls, bites her tongue and it's bleeding buckets? Head to the ER? Only if it's still bleeding after 10 or 15 minutes of applying direct pressure with a clean washcloth. The tongue is full of blood vessels, so it'll bleed a lot, which may scare her (and you!). ""With young children [applying direct pressure] is often very difficult, so it may be helpful to encourage her to suck on an ice pop, which can also provide pressure on the tongue and sometimes help stop the bleeding,"" says Dr. Frush. She adds that tongues usually heal nicely and it's very rare a child will lose enough blood from a tongue injury to become anemic. Parenting.com: 9 pediatric emergency essentials . To treat a tongue bite . DO: Dampen a clean washcloth with cool water, seat your child on your lap, then press the washcloth over the injured area of the tongue. Feed her cold foods, such as frozen yogurt. DON'T: Give your baby any acidic or salty foods while her tongue is healing because it will sting and make the pain worse.

1581,"(CNN) -- The chaotic scene unfolded with flash-bang grenades, rubber bullets and clouds of smoke. Canisters whizzed through the air amid deafening booms. Marine Lance Cpl. Scott Olsen went down. ""Medic! Medic!"" someone yelled. Olsen, 24, had seen his share of war in two tours of Iraq as a Marine. He was lucky, returning home physically unscathed. But Tuesday evening, near the corner of 14th Avenue and Broadway in Oakland, California, Olsen went down. The video images went viral: streams of crimson flowing down Olsen's head, his black T-shirt adorned with a white dove of peace, the war veteran carried to a hospital. And with that, the Occupy movement had a face. ""We are all Scott Olsen,"" declared its website. ""It's ironic,"" said his uncle George Nygaard, that Olsen should be the poster child for this movement. Ironic, said Olsen's Marine buddy and current roommate Keith Shannon, that a young man who fought for American freedoms should be injured exercising those same freedoms at home. He was 14 at the time of the September 11 attacks and graduated in 2005 from Onalaska High School with the same sense of patriotism that drove so many young men and women to join the military. He was working at Lindy's Subs and Salads when he decided to enlist. Soon, he was in Twentynine Palms in the Mojave Desert for training and the next year on his way to war. Olsen deployed twice with the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment to Iraq's Anbar province, site of some the war's fiercest battles. Shannon said they often encountered makeshift bombs in their 2006 tour during which 15 of their fellow Marines died. Nygaard said Olsen told him about a couple of close calls, one in which he rolled over a roadside bomb that somehow failed to detonate. Olsen had always been a quiet, shy kid, Nygaard said. A computer whiz, not a jock. And not the type of young man his friends had expected to become an activist. But war touched Olsen as it does almost everyone who comes that close. After his last tour of Iraq, he returned home with serious misgivings and gravitated to Nygaard, a former Marine himself who had returned from Vietnam feeling similarly. In small-town Wisconsin, uncle and nephew talked to each other about the larger issues of war. ""He came back thinking there were better ways to deal with things than war,"" Nygaard said. Olsen's parents, Nygaard said, didn't always understand the change in their son. But Nygaard felt an affinity for the young man. ""I am so much more proud of him now than when he was in (the Marine Corps), because he followed through on his convictions,"" Nygaard said. Those convictions led Olsen to Madison this year to join protests of a bill by Gov. Scott Walker to weaken organized labor in Wisconsin. ""Scott thought the workers were getting screwed,"" said Nygaard, who was on the streets with his nephew. This summer, Olsen's friend Shannon helped him get a job at OPSWAT, a technology firm in San Francisco. By then, Olsen had become deeply involved with Veterans for Peace and Iraq Veterans Against the War. At one event, he stood with a poster that read: ""32 veterans will try to commit suicide every day and 18 will succeed."" ""He worried deeply about his fellow brothers and sisters who are veterans,"" Nygaard said. That's what prompted him to join the Occupy movement, first in San Francisco and then across the bay in Oakland, Nygaard said. Olsen knew there were many veterans among America's down and out. For the past three weeks, he was working during the day and out all night at the Occupy protests, Shannon said. He came home only three or four times to the Daly City apartment the two shared -- mainly to do laundry. Still, the laid-back Olsen was never a screamer. He felt strongly about economic injustice and wanted to add his voice quietly to the fight. And so, Tuesday night, he was standing there, almost at parade rest, when he went down, witnesses said. He suffered a skull fracture and was in fair condition in the intensive care unit at Highland Hospital, a hospital spokesman said. Shannon and Nygaard said Olsen was conscious and communicating by writing on a notepad. Shannon said he has been told Olsen has asked to see him, but doctors have limited visitors. Olsen's parents were with him at the hospital. Meanwhile, Oakland police are investigating how Olsen was hurt. Protesters gathered for a vigil in his name. National outcry over police treatment of the protesters -- many others were injured or sickened by tear gas -- prompted Oakland Mayor Jean Quan to take responsibility for those who were hurt. And Scott Olsen became a household name. But back in Chaseburg, Wisconsin, Nygaard worried for his nephew. Concussions, he said, can come back to haunt you, even after you get over the bruises. A lot of veterans know that from Iraq and Afghanistan, where head injuries have been common. Only Olsen's luck ran out here, in America. Nygaard just hopes his nephew will recover to tell his own story. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Scott Olsen returned from two tours of Iraq without injury .

1582,"Bangkok (CNN) -- More than two months of floods and 8 million people affected -- the disaster in Thailand is immense; the aid effort a challenge. Much of the effort appears to be internally driven. Thais across the country are donating food, water and clothing to help their countrymen in the worst-hit areas. Donations have far surpassed previous years. Floods happen every year here, but these are the worst in half a century and have left at least 283 dead. The Thai military and aid groups share the responsibility of distributing the life-saving supplies. In the ancient city of Ayutthara, one of the worst-hit regions, military trucks move slowly down the main street, cutting through a constant river of water, passing out aid to those who can get close. Anyone who has a boat is using it to transport aid or to help neighbors carrying their possessions as water levels rise and engulf homes. Those who don't have a boat are making do with rubber tires or even slabs of Styrofoam. There is a true sense of teamwork between the communities. The Bangkok suburb of Sam Kok is sandwiched between the overflowing Chao Phraya River and the 2.5-meter floodwalls that are so far successfully protecting the inner and commercial part of the capital. The water here has nowhere to go and levels are rising fast. La Sinsap, 60, has had to move into the local temple as his house is completely submerged. He says the situation is dire and help is not getting there fast enough to those who don't live on the main street. ""It's very bad around here,"" he told CNN. ""We don't have enough to eat."" Temples are playing a significant role in the disaster. Thailand is overwhelmingly Buddhist and many temples, although flooded themselves, have some dry floors on higher ground and have opened their doors to those in need. Monk Somkuan Thanajaro says it will take a long time to fix the waterlogged temple where Sinsap is staying. Huge Buddhas sit in stagnant water along what was once a river bank. The worry is if the water doesn't recede soon, the damage to these historic monuments could be permanent. But Thanajaro's first concern is helping his community, many of whom are now sleeping in the temple. ""Whenever we get donations, we share it all with the villagers,"" he says. The international community is responding to the disasters playing out across Thailand. China has donated $1.5 million and the United States $1 million. The U.S. is also sending 26 helicopters to help the relief effort, invaluable as more roads turn to rivers and become impassable. United Nations agencies also are on standby, activating their assessment teams and contingency planning in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The World Health Organization has offered emergency health kits.","8 million people are affected by the floods, which have killed 283 people .

1583,"Rome (CNN) -- Seven people have died and seven others are missing after rains triggered severe flooding in northern Italy, civil protection officials said Friday. Especially hard hit was the tourist-popular Cinque Terre region on Italy's northwest coast. The Italian Council of Ministers declared a state of emergency in the flood region, which means 65 million euros ($91 million) will be put aside to deal with the disaster, the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported. A special cabinet meeting was called Friday to discuss the situation, the Italian government said. Heavy rains continued to fall Thursday night in Milan and other spots across the southern European nation, according to the Servizio Meteorologico, Italy's official weather agency. The agency gave an alert about intense, widespread rainfall -- potentially with strong wind gusts and hail -- in the regions of Calabria and Basilicata in southern Italy, as well as the eastern part of Sicily. Meanwhile, Monterosso al Mare -- between Genoa and Pisa in the Cinque Terre region of Liguria -- has been ""isolated, accessible only by sea"" because of earlier rains and floods, Mayor Angelo Betta told the news agency ANSA. So, too, is the nearby town of Vernazza, with even bulldozers and cranes still not able to reach it. That said, Betta reported some progress Thursday thanks to round-the-clock efforts by emergency workers and volunteers to clean up the town. One volunteer in that community died in the flood Wednesday. ""The situation is much better compared to yesterday,"" Betta said. Italy's Defense Ministry noted Thursday on its website that 348 military personnel have deployed to the provinces of Massa Carrara and La Spezia to assist in the wake of flooding here. Three people were killed after a house collapsed in La Spezia, an ANSA report said. ANSA also reported that prosecutors have opened a manslaughter investigation related to the deaths of two people from flood-related injuries in Aulla. Authorities are assessing whether their deaths had anything to do with faulty work that may have caused the Magra River to overflow. The weather has also caused major travel headaches throughout the region. A mudslide that trapped a truck driver, who was eventually freed, has caused the A12 highway in Liguria to be blocked since Tuesday. Train services in Liguria have been halted, too, due to mud and debris on the tracks. CNN's Hada Messia and Marilia Brochetto contributed to this report.","NEW: The death toll rises to seven and a state of emergency is declared .

An additional 19 American tourists and two Egyptians -- the bus driver and a tour guide -- were injured. A total of 116 American tourists were traveling in three tour buses. The interior ministry said the middle bus -- carrying 37 of the tourists -- crashed into a parked dump truck loaded with sand. Video of the crash site showed one side of the bus completely sheared off, with some seats dangling from the vehicle's shell. Dried blood could be seen on some of the crumpled wreckage. Twelve of those injured were taken to Nasser Medical Institute in Cairo, according to the hospital's head, Dr. Bahaa Al-deen Ziad. Two of the crash victims are in the hospital's intensive care unit in critical but stable condition, Ziad said. The 10 others were admitted to the hospital in stable condition and are being examined by doctors with specialties in neurosurgery, orthopedics and plastic surgery, he said. Aswan is a popular tourist site in Egypt located about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) away from Cairo. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo issued a statement Sunday saying it was ""deeply saddened"" by the accident. ""The embassy has confirmed that the injured are being moved by military transport to Cairo, and has mobilized staff to identify and to assist those Americans involved,"" the statement said. ""Consular services will be provided to assist any American citizens who have been affected and their families, in coordination with the Egyptian government.""

1585,"Miami (CNN) -- Kris Rakowski put the dog out late Friday and looked to the skies above his Maple Grove, Minnesota, residence. He saw lights -- a bunch of them. ""They almost looked like fireballs or fireflies, strobing,"" Rakowski told CNN Saturday. The art director, 35, who first began looking for possible signs of a plummeting U.S. satellite around 10 p.m., grabbed his camera. He's pretty sure the photos he submitted to CNN's iReport were pieces of the satellite, which entered the Earth's atmosphere around that time. ""It was a once in a lifetime opportunity,"" he said. NASA said the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite's debris fell to Earth between 11:23 p.m. ET Friday and 1:09 a.m. ET Saturday. The satellite passed over Africa and North America and likely landed off the West Coast of the United States, NASA said. ""The precise re-entry time and location of debris impacts have not been determined,"" NASA said. ""Twenty-six satellite components, weighing a total of about 1,200 pounds, could have survived the fiery re-entry and reach the surface of Earth. However, NASA is not aware of any reports of injury or property damage. "" NASA officials said it's possible the satellite pieces hit the Pacific Ocean. Initial reported sightings of the disintegrating satellite had not proved credible because they were not near the proper track, the agency said. Reports of suspected sightings emerged from San Antonio, where a TV photographer caught images of bright objects darting rapidly in the night sky, and from Hawaii, where Robert Jeffcoat saw what he believed were two chunks from the satellite. Jeffcoat was running errands when the first flying object left a thick, white trail that lingered in the sky for about 20 minutes, he said. A second object followed the same path and was ""massive,"" he said. ""It was like a comet, but smoke,"" he said. ""I'm guessing it landed in the ocean, the way it was going."" Mark Matney of NASA's Orbital Debris team in Houston said before the rubbish fell that there was no way to know exactly where the pieces would come down. ""Part of the problem is, the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways, and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it's coming down even right before the re-entry,"" Matney said. NASA said space debris the size of the satellite's components re-enters the atmosphere about once a year. Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell noted that the satellite is far from being the biggest space junk to come back. ""This is nothing like the old Skylab scare of the '70s, when you had a 70-ton space station crashing out of the sky,"" McDowell said. Pieces of Skylab came down in western Australia in 1979. Jeffcoat said he was amazed his home of Paia, Maui, seemed to be an ideal place to watch hunks of a satellite rain from the sky. ""Of all the places in the world where it could hit, here it was, in Maui,"" he said. ""It was quite weird."" CNN's John Zarella, Holly Yan, Phil Gast and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Location of debris is still not determined .

1586,"(CNN) -- As Japan's disaster evolves, so too are the measures taken to mitigate the chaos. One such initiative comes from U.S. military contractor iRobot, which will help Japan's army incorporate robots into their recovery efforts. The company joins at least two Japanese robotics teams on the ground in the quake- and tsunami-ravaged country, one of which operates an 8-meter-long, snakelike robot with a camera. iRobot, based in Bedford, Massachusetts, is donating four ground-based models to the Japan relief effort: two PackBots and two Warriors. The PackBot is an agile, battle-tested unit that's been used for bomb dispersal, recon and other tactical operations. Depending on its configuration, it weighs 45 to 60 pounds and is known for being highly customizable. ""Not every robot works in every situation,"" says iRobot Vice President Tim Trainer, ""so they have to be configured appropriately."" In Japan, the PackBot will be outfitted with HazMat sensors and deployed in areas of nuclear uncertainty, such as the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, to search for chemical, biological or radiological anomalies. The larger Warrior model is a 347-pound robot that can traverse rubble or wreckage and carry up to 200 pounds. For this mission, it will be configured with firefighting capabilities that allow it to deploy fire hoses or clear away rubble. It complements the PackBots' agility and scanning capabilities with the muscle to physically neutralize hot zones. Both the PackBot and the Warrior are remote-controlled from a distance of 800 meters (about half a mile). The PackBot transmits data about hazardous conditions to an operator in real time. Because Japan's relief workers face massive piles of impenetrable rubble, the robots might also play a key role in general search-and-recovery efforts, as the PackBot did at New York City's ground zero in the aftermath of 9/11. A dual track system on both units enhances mobility and makes it possible for them to navigate areas humans can't safely reach. The Packbots and Warriors are accompanied by six iRobot employees who will train Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force in their use. The units can be operated with an Xbox or PlayStation controller in a straightforward plug-and-play fashion. Once in the field, robots that enter nuclear hot zones aren't necessarily expected to make it back out, as contamination could render them unsafe for later. But by going where relief teams shouldn't, they might prevent additional, unnecessary human casualties. ""This is why we got into robotics,"" said iRobot's Trainer.

1587,"(CNN) -- The small, World War II-era plane that crashed Friday during a Reno, Nevada, air race was equipped with data and video recording devices that investigators hope to use to help determine what happened and why. Seven people, including the pilot, were killed when the plane crashed into spectators at the race, with two others later dying at area hospitals. Close to 70 people were injured. National Transportation Safety Board member Mark Rosekind on Sunday described this realization, as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices, as ""significant new information."" It was also not entirely expected, given the size and nature of the P-51 aircraft. ""I'm not aware of a lot of aircraft having it, this is the first one I came across,"" said Howard Plagens, who is the NTSB official heading the investigation. Plagens was referring to a ""box"" that recorded key variables such as altitude, latitude and oil pressure. In addition, there was an outward-facing video camera on the plane, according to Rosekind. Several memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device, and will be sent to the NTSB laboratory in Washington, D.C., for a full analysis, Rosekind said. They may belong to some of the 200,000 spectators then at the annual National Championship Air Races and Air Show. Investigators do have a copy of the ""box"" data, since it was sent in real time by telemetry to sources outside the aircraft. Besides the cards, Rosekind said parts of a plane's tail, an ""elevator trim tab"" and video camera fragments have been found. ""There were thousands of pieces of debris,"" Plagens said, explaining how the site had been laid out in a grid system to help organize the probe. As with the memory cards, one of the authorities' first goals will be to determine if these came from the plane being piloted by 74-year-old Jimmy Leeward. Countering earlier reports, Rosekind said on Sunday that Leeward did not send a ""Mayday call,"" indicating he was in distress. Investigators have repeatedly stated that it is not now known why the aircraft nosedived. Some speculation has surrounded the elevator trim tab -- which was breaking apart prior to the crash, a photograph shows. Besides the plane's trim tab, parts of a tail, the memory cards and already known plane data, investigators also will pore over ""a tremendous (amount of) video that was captured"" at the scene, according to Rosekind. While a preliminary report will be available Friday, Rosekind has said the full investigation could take six to nine months. ""It's not just what happened, it's why it happened,"" he said Sunday. ""(We're) trying to make sure this doesn't happen again."" Meanwhile, the crash's toll became clearer Sunday as more of those killed were identified. Besides Leeward, the dead include Michael Joseph Wogan, a 22-year-old from Phoenix who was attending the event with his father as part of a father-and-son vacation, his family said in a statement. His father, William, was ""seriously injured,"" the statement said. Wogan was diagnosed at an early age with muscular dystrophy, and was wheelchair-bound his entire life. However, his 19-year-old brother James Wogan said in the family statement, ""He was about moving past that and always driven toward independence. Michael liked to get out and travel, and he was so excited about getting on a plane as part of this trip."" Michael Wogan graduated magna cum laude from Arizona State University with a finance degree in May, his family said. He had operated a web development company and was in the process of developing a second business. Memorial service details were pending, the statement said. Also identified Sunday were George and Wendy Hewitt, members of Cascade EAA Warbirds Squadron 2. The Hewitts were killed when the plane crashed into the seating area, said R.D. Williams, a spokesman for the squadron. According to its website, the squadron aims to ""promote and encourage the preservation and operation of World War II and other such aircraft that are representative of military aviation operations"" along with educating people on safely operating and maintaining such aircraft. The plane that crashed Friday -- dubbed the ""Galloping Ghost"" -- was one such plane dating from that era. Several witnesses have portrayed Leeward -- a real estate developer from Ocala, Florida -- as a hero because he appeared to manuever the plane away from the crowded grandstands at the last moment. He went down around 4:15 p.m. PT Friday while taking part in a qualifying round in the ""unlimited class"" division of the air race, said Mike Draper, the show spokesman. The final rounds, which had been slated for the weekend, were cancelled. ""This is the first time in 40 years, I think, that we've had a visitor injured or killed,"" Reno Mayor Bob Cashell told reporters Saturday. ""We've lost some pilots, but we've never had a major catastrophe."" One local hospital, Renown Medical Center, received 34 patients, four of whom were in critical condition as of Sunday afternoon. Two patients -- a male and a female -- died, the hospital said Friday. Dr. Mike Morkin, the medical director of emergency services at the hospital, was on duty when the call about the crash came in Friday. ""The severity of this accident was the worst I've seen since I've been at Renown,"" Morkin, a 16-year veteran at the hospital, said. Renown South Meadows Medical Center received and discharged five patients, the hospital said Saturday. St. Mary's Hospital in Reno said it had accepted 28 patients from the accident: As of Sunday afternoon, two were in critical condition and six in serious condition. The remainder have been released.

1588,"(CNN) -- A 6.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Vancouver Island, British Columbia, on Friday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The center of the earthquake was approximately 175 miles west of the city of Vancouver and nearly 50 miles underground. Many people on Vancouver Island felt the quake, especially those in high-rises, which swayed back and forth, said John Cassidy of the Geological Survey in Victoria, British Columbia. He described the quake as originating 30 miles offshore. The shaking lasted 10 to 20 seconds, Cassidy said, and there were no reports of damage or injuries Friday afternoon. Earthquakes of such magnitude happen every decade or so, he said. There was no immediate danger of a tsunami as a result of the earthquake, authorities at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. CNN's Deanna Proeller and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: High-rises sway on Vancouver Island, but no injuries or damage is reported .

1589,"(CNN) -- A Moroccan court on Friday sentenced to death Adil Othmani, the main suspect in a terrorist attack in Marrakech last spring, Morocco's state news agency, Maghreb Arabe Presse, reported. Othmani was held responsible for an explosion that tore through a cafe April 28, killing 17 people and wounding 20 others. The blast occurred at Cafe Argana in Place Jemaa el Fna, a bazaar and square popular among tourists. Moroccan authorities said the bomber remotely triggered two explosives, which he had placed there while disguised as a Western hippie. A Moroccan Ministry of Justice official who refused to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the case confirmed that a death sentence has been handed down to the mastermind of the bombing, the news agency reported.

1590,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The mother of a German national suspected of one of the worst arson sprees in Los Angeles history appeared before a U.S. magistrate judge Tuesday in the German government's effort to extradite her on fraud charges. Harry Burkhart, 24, may have been motivated to set the fires by his mother's arrest, according to officials and CNN affiliates. His mother, 53-year-old Dorothee Burkhart, was arrested by Los Angeles police during a traffic stop on December 28, a day before the first of 52 fires, mostly in parked cars, that investigators suspect were part of a series of arsons. The son, who was arrested Monday, was charged with one count of arson of an inhabited dwelling. He is likely to face additional charges as the investigation moves forward, said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Harry Burkhart remains jailed without bail and is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. ""What did you do to my son,"" Dorothee Burkhart, yelled at the judge during her hearing Tuesday. ""My son is disappeared since yesterday. Perhaps the German Nazis know of our address."" It did not appear that she knew her son had been arrested a day earlier on the arson charge. She turned down an offer of a court-appointed lawyer and was given until her next hearing Friday to hire a defense attorney. A federal extradition complaint said she is wanted in Germany on 19 counts of fraud, including an allegation that she defrauded the doctor who performed breast augmentation surgery on her in 2004. The other fraud charges center on rent and security deposits for apartments in Frankfurt, Germany, the complaint said. A website advertising ""sensual tantra massage"" and offering ""full body hot oil body to body sliding massage"" is registered to Dorothee Burkhart using a Hollywood address, according to a domain registry database. She lived with her son in a Hollywood apartment, according to the complaint. Investigators seized press clippings of arson attacks in Germany from the apartment, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Dorothee Burkhart last entered the United States lawfully in January 2007 and left the country four months later, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She currently has no lawful immigration status and ICE has lodged an immigration detainer against her, it said. A court document released earlier on Tuesday incorrectly stated that Dorothee Burkhart had most recently entered the United States in October, according to ICE. Harry Burkhart was in the United States lawfully at the time of his arrest on a non-immigrant visa, which expires on January 18, ICE said. The agency has similarly lodged an immigration detainer against him. Arson investigators counted 52 fires, most starting in parked cars, since Friday morning, but none since the suspect was detained at 3 a.m. Monday, according to officials. No one was hurt in the fires, but property damage is likely to reach $3 million, said Los Angeles Fire Chief Brian Cummings. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday that after Los Angeles police released a surveillance video of a man seen near the scene of one fire, agents in the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security field office recognized Burkhart. Multiple CNN affiliates reported the alleged arson spree could have stemmed from a deportation battle between the suspect and immigration officials involving Burkhart's mother. After his arrest, Burkhart told investigators, ""I hate America,"" according to CNN affiliate KABC. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said officials believe -- and hope -- the fires were set by one person. But they will proceed as though others may be involved until they know for sure, Beck said. ""I feel very good that we've got the right guy. (The suspect) had the right stuff in his van, and we are confident in the arrest,"" Beck said. Neighbor Galina Larimoda told KABC-TV through a Russian translator that Harry Burkhart knocked on her door Sunday and seemed angry and not ""completely normal."" Los Angeles County Reserve Sheriff's Deputy Shervin Lalezary, who draws a salary of $1 a year, was hailed as a hero for arresting Burkhart. Lalezary, an Iranian-born lawyer who moonlights as a deputy, pulled over a van in Hollywood driven by a man who resembled the person seen on the surveillance video. With the help of backup officers, he then arrested the driver, Burkhart. CNN's Chuck Conder, Alan Duke, Paul Vercammen, Mike Ahlers, Ashley Hayes, Lateef Mungin, and Irving Last contributed to this report.","NEW: Harry Burkhart's mother has no lawful immigration status, ICE says .

1591,"(PEOPLE.com) -- Accidents happen, but the show must go on. That was Steven Tyler's outlook after he suffered a painful fall in a hotel bathroom in Paraguay on Tuesday -- an incident he described in detail Thursday on NBC's ""Today"" show. The Aerosmith frontman and ""American Idol"" judge, 63, says he was battling food poisoning and began to feel nauseous in the shower. ""I started to get sick, and I just fell on my face,"" he said. ""I just passed out."" His tour manager called the American Embassy and found the best hospital in the area. ""It was like one-stop shopping,"" said Tyler. ""They stitched up my eye. They did a little plastic surgery. And they fixed my tooth. All in one fell swoop."" Tyler, who notoriously battled drug and alcohol problems in the past, said he accepted the fact that some people might think he fell off the wagon. But he said this was an accident, not a relapse. ""I get that people think that,"" he said. ""It still bothers me a little, but it's something that I have to have to deal with for the rest of my life."" Tuesday's show in Paraguay was postponed by a day, but Tyler and the band played Wednesday to a raucous crowd, and the tour will continue. ""Short of having my leg taken off, people are going to expect me to take the stage,"" said Tyler. See the full article at PEOPLE.com. © 2011 People and Time Inc.

1592,"(CNN) -- The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is battling a large grass fire in the marshlands of Jefferson County, Texas, an agency official told CNN on Tuesday. The fire began Monday afternoon about 12 miles west of Sabine Pass and about 200 yards from the Intracoastal Waterway, Jim Stockie, spokesman for the fish and wildlife service said. He estimated the area burned by Tuesday afternoon to be between 10,000 and 12,000 acres, but he said the fire was not threatening any structures. Smoke from the blaze was drifting into the Houston/Galveston area more than 100 miles from the fire. Just a dozen firefighters were working the blaze, Stockie said. ""We don't like to put firefighters out in a sea of grass. We retreat to levies and burn off the fuel,"" Stockie said. Texas has suffered its worst fire season in state history with more than 3.5 million acres burned, according to state officials. In October, the Bastrop Complex Fire torched more than 1,500 homes and 34,000 acres of land north of Austin before officials were able to contain it, the Texas Fire Service said. An unusual La Nina weather pattern led to a nearly 11-month fire season in the state, fire service spokeswoman April Saginor said. A survey released last month by the Texas Forest Service estimated between 100 million and 500 million trees, or 2% to 10% of the state's 4.9 billion trees, were killed by the severe drought and consequent fires. The dry spell that began in 2010 was the worst the state has seen since 1895, Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst has said. The drought conditions also caused concern for the state's water supply, especially in smaller towns. CNN's Dave Alsup and Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","The fire began Monday afternoon .

1593,"(CNN) -- A 12-year-old west Florida boy apparently struck by a bullet fired skyward during a New Year's Eve celebration is improving, but remains in serious condition, authorities said Tuesday. Overnight, his condition was upgraded from critical to serious, said Larry McKinnon of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. The bullet is still lodged in the boy's head, and doctors are working to control the swelling around his brain. Until the bullet is removed, detectives cannot compare it to other bullets to help determine a possible suspect in the shooting, said McKinnon. Diego Duran, 12, was sitting in the front yard of his Ruskin, Florida, home watching fireworks about 1 a.m. Sunday when he fell to the ground, bleeding from the nose and eyes, McKinnon said. The victim's mother drove him to South Bay Hospital in Sun City Center, where doctors determined that a gunshot had gone through the top of the boy's head. The child was then transported to Tampa General Hospital, where he was in critical condition Sunday afternoon. The boy's mother, Sandy Duran, spoke to reporters Monday about her son. ""His brain is still in that stage of the 48 to 72 hours where it swells. There's a lot of inflammation going on, so the doctors cannot say what he will and won't be able to do,"" she said. ""The good news is that he is moving his extremities. He can move his hands. He can move his legs. He has opened his eyes."" Duran described her son as ""noble"" and said he enjoyed skating and playing guitar. He is the youngest of three children, and her family is taking it ""hour by hour,"" she said. ""For me, it's a miracle that he's alive considering what has just happened to him,"" said Duran. No one in the immediate area around the victim's house was firing a gun, the boy's relatives and neighbors told detectives. Police believe that celebratory gunfire, possibly shot from miles away, wounded the boy. If the wound is determined to be from a celebratory gunshot, it would not be the first time a child was inadvertently shot in the Southeast on New Year's Eve and in the hours after midnight. In 2009, 4-year-old Marquel Peters died after a bullet went through the roof of a suburban Atlanta church and hit him. The boy's mother, Nathalee Peters, has launched an online effort -- called Marquel's Pledge -- to urge people not to shoot into the air in celebration. It's one of several such campaigns nationwide, including one in Miami called, ""One bullet kills the party."" Duran similarly spoke about the need to educate the public about the dangers of celebratory gunfire. ""I'm speaking out because I don't think there's enough awareness out there,"" she said. ""A firearm is a weapon. It's a weapon that takes a life. It's not a toy for celebration.""

1594,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Ten people were killed Monday in a suicide bombing outside a U.N. compound in Kandahar, Afghanistan, officials said. Three employees working for the U.N. Refugee Agency were killed in the attack, as well as two Afghan civilians and an Afghan National Police officer, according to officials. In addition, four assailants were killed, according to a press release from the local Kandahar government. Five others were injured, Afghan officials said. The attack began when a truck full of explosives blew up near the U.N. compound, according to the government release. The massive blast, which shattered the windows of buildings surrounding the compound, was followed by an hours-long gunbattle with police, who prevented the insurgents from breaching the compound. The U.N. Refugee Agency is ""seeking a fuller understanding of the circumstances of today's attack. Nevertheless the fact remains that people working for us have been wounded and killed and the functioning of our Kandahar office seriously disrupted,"" according to a statement from the group. Gen. Hamid Wardag, a local commander of the Afghan National Army, attributed the attack to the Taliban. ""This is a tragedy for UNHCR and for the families of the dead and wounded,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said in a statement. ""It also underscores the great risks for humanitarian workers in Afghanistan."" The U.S. Embassy in Kabul also expressed its condolences to the families of the victims. Kandahar province has seen a rash of recent violence. On Thursday, insurgents launched attacks on a Provincial Reconstruction Team base and a military outpost, Afghan and NATO officials said. Insurgents fired small guns and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) toward the Provincial Reconstruction Team, said Agha Lali, a member of the Kandahar provincial council. Officials killed two of the attackers, according to a regional police chief. And on October 22, three U.S. service members were killed when an improvised explosive device blew up near their assault force.

1595,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A child cries from hunger, but no tears come from her swollen eyes. A Zimbabwean family bury their relative, who died of cholera, 25km from Harare, Zimbabwe. Malnutrition has left this baby born in Zimbabwe fighting for her life. She is the face of an unfolding crisis in a country once known as Africa's bread basket. Today a loaf of bread costs $35 million worthless Zimbabwean dollars, and people are forced to sift through garbage piles for any morsel of food. Others huddle for warmth around a fire burning inside the shell of a broken-down van. All of these images were captured on video recently smuggled out of Zimbabwe by Solidarity Peace Trust, a South African human rights group.  Watch the disturbing images » . Zimbabwe's government maintains that the situation is being exaggerated by the West in an effort to exert pressure on President Robert Mugabe to leave office. But the World Health Organization (WHO) says the desperate situation has triggered a widening cholera outbreak that has killed 775 people and infected more than 15,000. ""You have to eat in the same place you sleep right next to the buckets, the same buckets that we used as toilets,"" one cholera patient says on the video. ""There is no water to bathe."" And little to eat. Women foraging for food in the bush find dry branches with only a few berries. ""This packet of juice will be my supper tonight,"" one woman says. Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai -- who is still trying to form a unity government with Mugabe under a recent power-sharing deal -- said the situation can only be addressed once a ""legitimate government"" is in place. ""Once there is a legitimate government, it is up to that government to deal with the problems the country is facing, which are quite wide-ranging,"" Tsvangirai told CNN on Wednesday. ""But the immediate intervention of the health crisis has exacerbated the situation to the extent that it has now become an international crisis."" The WHO says the current cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has a high fatality rate because sufferers are either not able to reach health centers in time or that the health centers lack the capacity to treat the cases. ""The epidemic is clearly on the increase,"" Dr. Eric Laroche, a WHO official in Harare, told CNN on Wednesday. ""I think it's going to last for several months."" In addition to the WHO, the Red Cross has responded to the outbreak and is sending staff and medical supplies into Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's main hospitals have all but shut down and the small clinics equipped by international aid organizations are overcrowded and unable to cope with the thousands of cholera patients. Health workers inside Zimbabwe believe scores are dying at home. Laroche said the WHO is receiving cooperation from the government, but the health care system is abysmal. ""The quality of the care, the supplies that come inside Zimbabwe, also need to be restored,"" Laroche said. ""So there's a lot of work to do, because the health system is collapsing for the time being."" One Zimbabwean health care worker, who would not show his face on the video, said he fears the death toll will skyrocket. ""People are dying even at the health institution,"" he said. ""It's beyond control. We are going to witness so many deaths in the coming weeks."" He expressed frustration that so many people are dying from cholera, a disease that ""is both preventable and curable."" ""Nobody should die from cholera,"" he said. ""We are quite unfortunate."" Zimbabwe, already experiencing an economic crisis, was struck with the raging water-borne cholera in August. Health experts say the battle against the disease can only be won if Harare has adequate water-treating chemicals and disposes of refuse properly. Zimbabwe's information minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said Tuesday that the country has enough chemicals to purify water and enough money to buy pipes to mend sanitation lines. He maintained that the outbreak is under control, blaming the West for causing the crisis as an excuse for military intervention. International leaders -- including U.S. President George W. Bush, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Kenyan premier Raila Odinga -- have recently called for Mugabe to step down for failing to contain the cholera outbreak. Frustration inside Zimbabwe is building. Last week, doctors and nurses protested over the lack of medical supplies and other resources at the country's hospitals. Labor unions have protested over the deteriorating economy. Even soldiers once shielded from economic hardships by the Mugabe regime went on a rampage last week when they were unable to access wages from the country's banks. Human rights activist Elinor Sisulu, who has lived and worked in Zimbabwe and now coordinates civil action outside the country, called on African leaders to demand Mugabe step down before Zimbabwe explodes. ""In any population where you have high levels of desperation, anger and ... people arrive at the conclusion that we've tried a peaceful political process and this is not working, then anything can happen,"" she said. -- CNN's Nkepile Mabuse in Johannesburg, South Africa contributed to this report.","WHO: Nearly 775 people have died in Zimbabwe from cholera outbreak .

1596,"(CNN) -- In the wake of a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis linked to bacteria-tainted cantaloupe, authorities assured the public that cantaloupe grown in places other than Colorado's Jensen Farms is safe. But if in doubt about a fruit's origin, they said, it's best to throw it out. The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported September 12. As of Wednesday, it had grown to 72 cases in 18 states and had killed 13 people, officials with the Centers for Disease Control said. The number of cases is expected to rise, as it can take one to three weeks for a person who ingests the bacteria to show symptoms. All of the tainted cantaloupes were grown at Jensen Farms in Granada, Colorado, although they were shipped to 17 states -- Illinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. ""It's important to know that if you know the cantaloupe that you have is not Jensen Farms, then it's OK to eat,"" CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters during a conference call Wednesday. ""But if you're in doubt, then throw it out."" The recalled cantaloupes may bear a green-and-white sticker that says, ""Product of USA-Frontera Produce-Colorado Fresh-Rocky Ford-Cantaloupe,"" or a gray, yellow and green sticker that says, ""Jensen Farms-Sweet Rocky Fords."" But not all cantaloupes may have a sticker, Frieden said. Consumers are urged to ask the supermarket or supplier if they know where the cantaloupes came from. If the cantaloupe's origins remain unconfirmed, it should be disposed of, he said. However, the likelihood of tainted cantaloupes in the nation's food supply is decreasing, thanks to the fruit's short shelf life -- about two weeks, officials said. The recalled cantaloupes were shipped from July 29 through September 10, ""so we really are nearing the end of the shelf life of the product in addition to its recalled product,"" Sherri McGarry, a senior adviser with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), told reporters. The recall itself should be removing the cantaloupes from shelves, she said, but the shelf life means the tainted cantaloupes will not be edible much longer. ""But consumers do have their own practices so we need to be cognizant some folks may hold that a little bit longer than we might expect,"" she said. If consumers do have a cantaloupe from Jensen Farms, authorities recommend they don't try to wash off the bacteria. ""We want you to throw that product away,"" McGarry said. The fruits should be disposed of in a closed plastic bag and placed in a sealed trash can, to prevent people or animals from eating them, the CDC said. Refrigeration will not kill the Listeria bacteria, which can grow even at low temperatures, officials said. And the longer a contaminated food is stored in the refrigerator, the more opportunity the bacteria has to grow. ""It is very important that consumers clean their refrigerators and other food preparation surfaces"" in order to minimize risk, the FDA says on its website. After washing refrigerators, cutting boards and countertops, the agency recommends sanitizing them with a solution of one tablespoon chlorine bleach per gallon of hot water and drying them with a paper towel or cloth that has not been previously used. Jensen Farms has now ended its cantaloupe harvest for the season, so no new contaminated fruit will be entering the market, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said Wednesday. Although Jensen Farms does produce other products, there is no concern for any other product from the company, McGarry said. Listeriosis causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It rarely is a serious concern for healthy children and adults, the CDC said, but can be dangerous for older adults or those with weakened immune systems. It can be treated with antibiotics. The source of the outbreak -- the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998 -- remained under investigation. Officials could not give a figure Wednesday for the number of cantaloupes recalled.","Health officials say the only contaminated fruit is from Jensen Farms .

1597,"(CNN) -- A Texas Rangers fan who fell over a railing while trying to catch a ball will have a place at Rangers Ballpark next season after the team erects a statue in his memory. Shannon Stone, a 39-year-old firefighter from Brownwood, Texas, fell to his death July 7. His 6-year-old son Cooper witnessed the accident. ""The statue, which is tentatively to be named Rangers Fans, is expected to be in place for the 2012 season,"" the Texas Rangers announced in a statement Monday. It will depict Stone and his son attending a Rangers game. ""The full-size bronze statue is likely to be located outside the home plate gate of Rangers Ballpark in Arlington,"" the Rangers said. The tragedy took place in the second inning of the ill-fated game. Star outfielder Josh Hamilton tossed a souvenir ball into the stands after a batter hit a foul ball. Stone stuck out his glove and reached for the ball, but lost his balance and flipped over the railing of the outfield seats. He fell about 20 feet and crashed head-first into an area near a scoreboard. Stone died of blunt-force trauma, according to the Tarrant County medical examiner. Rangers President Nolan Ryan, a Hall of Fame pitcher, has said the club would review the height of railings at the stadium, even though they already exceeded the city's code limits. The team has set up an account accepting donations in Stone's honor with the Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation. Donated money has been earmarked to help the Stone family. The Rangers have donated an undisclosed sum, according to the team's website. Stone's widow, Jenny, said she appreciates Ryan and the Rangers during the family's time of loss. ""Shannon and Cooper had a special relationship, and we are touched and grateful that it will be memorialized at one of their favorite places,"" she said in the statement. ""Our hope is that this statue will not be a symbol of our family tragedy but rather a reminder of the importance of a family's love -- love of each other, love of spending time together, and love of the game.""

1598,"(CNN) -- Hurricane Ophelia got even more powerful Friday night as it churned across the Atlantic toward Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center reported. A tropical storm watch was in effect for that mid-Atlantic island, but Ophelia's increasingly northerly path suggests it won't directly threaten the coastal United States. The system was disorganized and seemed to be weakening last week. But it has gained steam in recent days and earlier Friday was upgraded to a Category 3 hurricane. According to the center's 8 p.m. update, Ophelia had maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, which is 5 mph stronger than those recorded three hours earlier. Its center was located 480 miles south-southeast of Bermuda. Ophelia has also gotten faster, increasing in speed 4 mph as it heads north at around 16 mph. With an expected turn more to the north-northeast, the storm is expected to strike the eastern part of Bermuda late Saturday, reports the hurricane center. The Miami-based forecasters said that there could be fluctuations in Ophelia's intensity over the next 12 to 24 hours, followed by a gradual weakening. Hurricane-force winds extended about 30 miles from the storm's eye, center said. Tropical storm-force winds, which are winds between 39 mph and 73 mph, have been recorded 175 miles away. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Philippe has strengthened somewhat as it spins farther east in the Atlantic, with its eye some 1,100 miles east-northeast of the Leeward Islands as of 5 p.m. Friday. As of that update, its sustained winds were 50 mph, which is slightly stronger than the previous update. The hurricane center predicted ""some weakening"" over the next 48 hours, during which it was set to turn more toward the west-northwest.","NEW: Ophelia now has maximum sustained winds of 120 mph .

1599,"Beijing (CNN) -- A typhoon that killed at least 39 people in the Philippines made landfall in southern China on Thursday. Chinese authorities evacuated 300,000 people as they prepared for the effects of Typhoon Nesat, a disaster-response agency reported. It is the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Nesat made landfall in southern China's Hainan province, bringing strong winds and rain to Wengitan Township and nearby areas, Xinhua reported. In addition to evacuations, authorities in southern China recalled ships and suspended scheduled flights and ferry trips as they steeled for the typhoon's effect, the news agency reported. The death toll from the storm in the Philippines, meanwhile, has increased. The storm killed 39 people, injured 43 others and left 31 missing, according to the most recent figures from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Nesat -- referred to in the Philippines as Pedring -- displaced thousands in the archipelago nation, the state-run Philippines News Agency reported. A baby boy was among the dead when the typhoon slammed into the Philippines on Tuesday, authorities said. The storm struck the agricultural provinces of Isabela and Aurora the hardest. But storm alerts were also issued for more than 40 other areas, including metro Manila, the state weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said. Nearly 680,000 people were affected by the typhoon in 31 provinces, the disaster council said. More than 120 people were rescued across the country, the council said, many of them from boats. Some roads around Manila were impassable due to flooding and falling debris, including branches that had been ripped off trees. Several areas in Metro Manila and nearby provinces were without electricity as the powerful storm cut power and transmission lines. Meanwhile, another storm -- Tropical Storm Nalgae -- is expected to make landfall in the Philippines on Saturday, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency's Typhoon Center.","Typhoon Nesat has made landfall in southern China .

1600,"(CNN) -- Hindered by painful stings and strong currents, endurance swimmer Diana Nyad ended her latest attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida about two-thirds of the way through the crossing Sunday. The 62-year-old Nyad suffered jellyfish and Portuguese man-of-war stings Saturday, while ocean cross-currents were pushing her off course, team captain Mark Sollinger said. She was pulled out of the water about 11 a.m. Sunday, about 67 nautical miles through the 103-nautical-mile passage. Treading water before being helped out of the water, Nyad said the man-of-war stings had paralyzed some of the muscles in her back, given her chills and nausea. Doctors warned her she could suffer long-term health problems if she suffered another sting. ""I've never been in any pain, ever, like that in my whole life,"" she said, adding, ""Now it's set me so far back, I just don't' have the lung capacity to swim the way I can."" It was her third attempt to make the swim from Cuba to Florida. Her first, in 1978, was brought to an end by strong currents and bad weather after almost 42 hours in the water. She made a second try in August, before she was pulled from the water after 60 miles and almost 29 hours of swimming. She blamed a shoulder injury she suffered early in the journey, and an 11-hour-long asthma attack. Her latest attempt, accompanied by shark divers, began just after 6 p.m. Friday from Havana's Hemingway Marina. The former world champion swimmer projected the swim would take close to 60 hours. There was a bit of excitement early Saturday afternoon as an oceanic whitetip shark swam near Nyad, but a diver on her team faced it off and it meandered away. The swimmer improved her performance late Saturday morning after struggling to maintain her usual stroke rate, her support team said. Fortified by chicken soup, Nyad was making good progress until the Saturday evening incident. Nyad got back in the water at 12:20 a.m. Sunday and swam for nearly 11 hours before packing it in. ""But for each of us, isn't life about determining your own finish line?"" she said in a statement on her website. ""This journey has always been about reaching your own other shore no matter what it is, and that dream continues.""

1601,"(Health.com) -- People with depression are more likely to have a stroke than their mentally healthy peers, and their strokes are more likely to be fatal, according to a new analysis published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Depression is a relatively minor risk factor for stroke compared to high blood pressure (hypertension) and other health conditions and behaviors that damage blood vessels, the researchers say. Still, their analysis suggests that as many as 4% of the estimated 795,000 strokes that occur in the United States each year can be attributed to depression. ""If you have depression but no other health issues, you probably don't have to pay too much attention to stroke risk,"" says An Pan, Ph.D., the lead author of the analysis and a research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health, in Boston. ""But if you are depressed and are also obese, or have hypertension or...unhealthy lifestyle factors, your risk is going to increase dramatically."" Health.com: The 10 most depressing states in the U.S. Pan and his colleagues combined data from 28 studies dating back to the mid-1990s that included about 318,000 people overall. Roughly 2.7% of the participants had a stroke during the studies, which ranged in length from two to 29 years. Compared to those who showed no signs of depression, people who received a depression diagnosis from a doctor or who reported feeling depressed were 45% more likely to have a stroke and 55% more likely to die from a stroke, the researchers found. Depression increased the risk of ischemic stroke, in which a blood vessel becomes blocked and cannot send blood to the brain. But it did not measurably raise the risk of the other major type, hemorrhagic stroke, in which a blood vessel leaks or bursts open. Health.com: 12 signs of depression in men . The new study is the latest in a long line of research linking depression to chronic disease and serious physical health problems. ""We knew that depression raises a person's risk of developing diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease,"" Pan says. ""We also knew that depression can occur after patients suffer a stroke. We just didn't have strong enough evidence to know if the reverse was true, or what really comes first."" Researchers have already established that depression increases the risk of heart attacks (and especially fatal ones), so it makes sense that depression would have a similar association with stroke, says Norman Rosenthal, M.D., a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, in Washington, D.C. ""Strokes and heart attacks both represent blood vessels becoming blocked and blood being withheld from a vital organ, whether it's the heart or the brain,"" says Rosenthal, who was not involved in the new study. ""They're essentially the same disease."" Health.com: Careers with high rates of depression . Depression could contribute to strokes in many ways, Pan says. For starters, people who are depressed are more likely to smoke or drink heavily, to follow an unhealthy diet, and to neglect their personal health. Most of the studies included in the analysis controlled for these and other risk factors, but the data suggests that at least some of the stroke risk in depressed people can be explained by an unhealthy lifestyle. There are other possibilities, as well, that aren't as easily measured. Depression can increase the production of stress hormones in the body, for instance, and can trigger dangerous inflammation in the blood vessels. ""Little things, like keeping up good dental hygiene or socializing with friends, all affect inflammation levels -- and these are things that a depressed person is less likely to do,"" says Rosenthal. Depression may also cause people to slack on taking medications needed to control other stroke-related conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. On the other hand, some medications prescribed for depression -- most notably the class of drugs known as atypical antipsychotics -- have been shown to cause weight gain and obesity, a known risk factor for stroke. More research is needed to determine whether depression drugs contribute to stroke risk. Doctors should monitor weight gain and blood pressure levels in patients taking these drugs, but there's no reason for patients to stop taking them, Pan says. ""For now, physicians should prescribe medication if they think it is necessary, or if non-drug treatments haven't worked."" Although depression isn't the most important risk factor for stroke, the researchers say it likely has a noticeable impact on the stroke rate. They estimate that depression is responsible for an additional 106 strokes per 100,000 people in the United States each year.

1602,"(CNN) -- Authorities have identified seven of the 10 people who died following a crash at an air show in Reno, Nevada, on Friday. The list includes the pilot, 74-year-old Jimmy Leeward, who lost control of his vintage plane before it plummeted into a crowd of spectators. Seven people, including the pilot, were killed on the tarmac, while three others died at area hospitals. Almost 70 people were injured. The six others identified are Joseph Wogan, 22, of Arizona; George and Wendy Hewitt of Washington state; Regina Bynum, 53, of Texas; Sharon Stewart, 47, of Nevada; and Gregory Morcom, 47, from Washington state. Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board announced Sunday that the small World War II-era plane was equipped with data and video recording devices that they hope to use to help determined what happened and why. NTSB member Mark Rosekind described the devices, as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices, as ""significant new information."" It was also not entirely expected, given the size and nature of the P-51 aircraft. ""I'm not aware of a lot of aircraft having it, this is the first one I came across,"" said Howard Plagens, the NTSB official heading the investigation. Plagens was referring to a ""box"" that recorded key variables such as altitude, latitude and oil pressure. In addition, there was an outward-facing video camera on the plane, according to Rosekind. Several memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device and will be sent to the NTSB laboratory in Washington for a full analysis, Rosekind said. They may belong to some of the 200,000 spectators who were at the annual National Championship Air Races and Air Show. Investigators do have a copy of the ""box"" data, since it was sent in real time by telemetry to sources outside the aircraft. Besides the cards, Rosekind said, parts of a plane's tail, an ""elevator trim tab"" and video camera fragments have been found. ""There were thousands of pieces of debris,"" Plagens said, explaining how the site had been laid out in a grid system to help organize the investigation. As with the memory cards, one of the authorities' first goals will be to determine whether these came from the plane. Countering earlier reports, Rosekind said Sunday that Leeward did not send a ""Mayday call,"" indicating he was in distress. Investigators have repeatedly stated that it is not known why the aircraft nosedived. Some speculation has surrounded the elevator trim tab, which was breaking apart prior to the crash, a photograph shows. Investigators also will pore over ""a tremendous (amount of) video that was captured"" at the scene, according to Rosekind. A preliminary report will be available Friday, but Rosekind has said the full investigation could take six to nine months. ""It's not just what happened, it's why it happened,"" he said Sunday. ""(We're) trying to make sure this doesn't happen again.""","10 people died from the crash .

1603,"(CNN) -- One person was killed and four critically injured Tuesday in a series of highway pileups triggered by a dense dust storm on Interstate 10 in central Arizona, a state law enforcement official said. The dust storm moved through the Pichacho Peak area, about 40 miles north of Tucson, at about 12:15 p.m. (3:15 p.m. ET) and caused ""minimal visibility"" on a stretch of Interstate 10 there, said Bart Graves, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety. ""We have two chain reaction crashes in the westbound lanes,"" Graves said. ""All involve commercial vehicles and passenger cars. There is one confirmed fatality and two additional victims with life-threatening injuries."" Graves said 16 vehicles were involved in the chain reaction accidents at Pichacho Peak. ""We closed the eastbound lanes to allow emergency responders access to the scene,"" he said. ""Due to the poor visibility, all patients were transported by ground ambulance to Tucson area hospitals."" ""The dust continues to cause a major hindrance to DPS officers and other rescue personnel,"" Graves said. Another pileup, this one involving eight vehicles, occurred about an hour and a half later, 20 miles to the south on I-10, Graves said. Two people were critically injured in that incident, which occurred on the eastbound lanes of I-10. Graves said he could not estimate when the interstate would reopen in either direction.

1604,"(CNN) -- The head of JetBlue is apologizing for a ""confluence of events"" that left a plane filled with passengers stranded on the tarmac at Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Connecticut, over the weekend. Chief Operating Officer Rob Maruster said in a video posted on the company's blog and its YouTube Channel that the airline had six flights divert to Hartford during the freak weekend snowstorm ""due to various runway, congestion and other operational issues at Newark and JFK Airports"" and that the airline ""did not deplane those aircraft in our target time allotted."" One of those flights, JetBlue 504 from Fort Lauderdale spent nearly eight hours stranded on the tarmac before passengers were allowed to deplane. ""At no point in this weekend was safety ever compromised,"" Maruster said, stressing that safety was the airline's number one concern. ""But let's face it, you count on us at JetBlue for a lot more -- and we promise a lot more -- and we know we let some of you down over the course of this weekend and for that we are truly sorry."" Maruster said the airline intends to ""fully participate with the Department of Transportation and cooperating with their investigation into events over the weekend, and we're also going to conduct an internal evaluation so that we can learn from this event because at the end of the day, you deserve better -- and we expect better from our crewmembers and our operation."" ""We can only earn your loyalty and trust one flight at a time and we ask you to give us a second chance."" JetBlue Flight 504 departed Fort Lauderdale at 10:07 a.m. ET Saturday -- 32 minutes late. The flight made it to Newark -- just not to the runway, thanks to the weather before it was diverted to Hartford. It landed at 1:07 p.m. What came next was an eight-hour ordeal for passengers -- and crew -- as the plane sat stuck on the tarmac with little food or water. ""I got a problem here on the airplane. I'm going to need to have the cops onboard,"" a flight crew member told the tower in a conversation posted on LiveATC.net, a website that monitors air traffic control conversations. ""I need some air stairs brought over here and the cops brought onboard the airplane."" Passenger Roseann Kozma explained the situation in a phone interview with CNN affiliate WTIC-TV from the plane. ""A couple passengers are fighting and there's a baby on here that's been crying the whole time,"" she said. ""We cannot go to the bathrooms anymore. There's no running water,"" said Todd Bailey, another passenger. ""They tell us that we're going to be going in soon, going in soon, going in soon -- and it just never happens."" Adding to the frustration and tension were passengers with medical conditions. ""I have a paraplegic that needs to come off,"" the pilot said. ""I have a diabetic here that's got an issue ... I've just got to get some help."" But the plane was still not at a gate, further frustrating the pilot. ""Look, you know, we can't seem to get any help from our own company,"" the pilot told the tower. ""I apologize for this, but if there is any way you can get a tug and a tow bar out here to us and get us towed somewhere to a gate or something. I don't care, take us anywhere."" The pilot, though frustrated, offered thanks to Bradley International officials. ""Listen, I just want to put in my two cents worth in for whatever it worth. Thank you very much,"" he said. ""It's Capt. Thompson over here on (Flight) 504 ... I think we've got more help from you guys than our own people."" The passengers broke into applause when the door finally opened, saying ""Let us out! Let us out! Let us out!"" Passengers deplaned around 9 p.m., according to JetBlue.","JetBlue head says the airline let some of its customers down .

1605,"(CNN) -- In the early morning hours Saturday, surviving remnants of a NASA satellite re-entered Earth's atmosphere over a remote stretch of the southern Pacific Ocean, the U.S. space agency said Tuesday. Nick Johnson, NASA's chief scientist for orbital debris, said on the agency's website that the re-entry point was in the general vicinity of Christmas Island, south of Indonesia. ""It's unlikely that anyone actually observed the re-entry,"" Johnson said, adding that NASA has yet to receive any reports of a sighting from airplanes, ships or island inhabitants in the region. A NASA statement on the website, labeled the final status report on the falling satellite, said it entered the atmosphere at 0400 GMT Saturday, midnight on the U.S. East Coast, over ""a broad, remote ocean area in the Southern Hemisphere."" The exact coordinates cited by NASA were 14.1 degrees south latitude and 189.8 degrees east longitude (170.2 west longitude). According to the statement, debris would have landed 300 to 800 miles northeast of the re-entry point. The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite was launched in 1991 on a space shuttle mission and ceased its scientific life in 2005, the NASA statement said. It broke into pieces during re-entry, NASA said, with 26 chunks weighing a total of 1,200 pounds considered likely to reach the Earth's surface. According to NASA, space debris the size of the satellite's components re-enters the atmosphere about once a year.","NASA has not received any reports of people seeing the falling debris .

1606,"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The pilot of a tugboat towing a barge that crashed into a sightseeing ""duck boat"" -- killing two tourists -- intends to plead guilty to a charge stemming from the July 2010 accident, federal prosecutors said Thursday . Matthew R. Devlin, 35, of Catskill, New York, has agreed to plead guilty to one count of misconduct of a ship operator causing death, according to a statement from the office of the U.S. attorney for eastern Pennsylvania. He also will surrender his ship¹s mate license, the statement said. Devlin could be sentenced to up to 46 months in prison, the statement said. No sentencing date was given. The plea agreement closes the case, the statement said. Two tourists from Hungary -- one 16 years old, the other 20 -- died when a 250-foot sludge barge towed by the tugboat overran a disabled 33-foot ""Ride the Ducks"" tour boat on the Delaware River, plunging the amphibious vessel and its 35 passengers and two crew members underwater. According to National Transportation Safety Board findings, tugboat pilot Devlin made and received 21 cell phone calls in addition to surfing the web using a company laptop during his more than two hours at the wheel. The NTSB released its final report on June 21. The incident was ""another tragic example of the deadliness of distraction,"" Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the NTSB, said after the final report showed several people involved were on the cell phones or computers. After the accident, Devlin initially told his superiors and the Coast Guard that he was dealing with a serious family medical emergency involving his 6-year-old son. The sightseeing duck boat was anchored in the shipping channel after being shut down because the boat's operator saw smoke and feared an on-board fire. Lawyers who represented the families of the two victims released a statement Thursday saying the families ""are gratified that Federal prosecutors have acted to hold one of the responsible parties accountable in this tragedy that should have been avoided."" The statement from attorneys Robert J. Mongeluzzi, Andrew Duffy, Peter Ronai and Holly Ostrov Ronai added that the families ""expect the corporations who were involved to acknowledge their roles and act accordingly."" The statement did not elaborate.","Two tourists from Hungary died in the July 2010 accident .

1607,"(CNN) -- While snow from a massive winter storm system continued to fall Wednesday night in parts of the Northeast, millions in the Midwest were left to dig themselves out, brave dangerously frigid temperatures and cope with sporadic power outages. An Arctic cold front followed the storm that dumped nearly 2 feet of snow in some locales, complicating cleanup efforts and spurring freeze warnings that spanned much of the nation's midsection. In much of Wisconsin, for instance, wind chill values were expected between 20 and 25 degrees below zero Wednesday night, according to the National Weather Service. Still, Green Bay Packers fans down in north Texas ahead of their team's Super Bowl showdown with the Pittsburgh Steelers only got a relative respite, temperature-wise. In Arlington, Texas, site of Sunday's game, there was a wind chill advisory in effect due to very cold conditions that made the temperature feel between zero and minus-10 degrees, and several inches of snow and ice had a debilitating effect in parts of Dallas, Fort Worth and their surrounding areas. ""It was funny to see a whole city shut down. Everything was closed,"" said Packers' defensive lineman Ryan Pickett. ""In Green Bay, this is just a normal day."" The problems facing Texas were largely because of icy conditions exacerbated by cold temperatures. Besides slick roads, Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement that the weather put an unprecedented demand on the state's energy grid, leading to power outages Wednesday that were expected to continue into Thursday. Furthermore, 50 power  plants were out statewide due to the extreme weather,  leading to a 10%-15% reduction in electricity production, said the  state's utility commission  spokesman Terry Hadley. The commission said in a statement  that rotating outages would be  limited to 10 to 45 minutes, unless equipment fails due to a power surge  during the restoration process. It's all part of the effects of a storm system that blanketed 30 states with a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain over several days, producing record-breaking accumulations in several Midwest locales, making for treacherous travel on snow-choked roadways and forcing airlines to cancel thousands of flights. The huge  demand for information caused sporadic outages for the National Weather Service's  web servers, which struggled to handle a deluge of 10 million to 20  million hits per hour, officials said. The site normally get 70 million hits per day. The last of the storm was drenching the Northeast late Wednesday, dumping freezing rain and snow in much of southern New England. While the amounts were less there than what some had forecast previously, the cumulative effect of relentless precipitation had a crippling impact in places. In Massachusetts, for instance, a number of roofs collapsed under the weight of rain-soaked snow, including the roof of a large commercial building in the town of Easton, according to fire captain David Beals. Up to 100 employees were evacuated prior to the collapse, he said. No injuries were reported. About 800 miles away, residents of Chicago were recovering from the system, which at times hit the Windy City hard with its combination of strong gusts and blinding precipitation. O'Hare International Airport received a record-breaking 20.2 inches of snow, according to the weather service. Raymond Roscoe, chief of staff for Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, said that many motorists remained stuck in their cars throughout the night, while others abandoned their vehicles. Police, fire department and sanitation crews spent much of the night pulling people out of their cars, he said. Roscoe said there were no reports of injuries. ""There were no cars or people on the street and you couldn't see the buildings nearby because of the thick snow,"" said city resident Sruthi Swaminathan. ""The only thing you could see clearly were the lights from the Chicago theater."" The good news was that the blizzard warnings for northeastern Illinois, including the Chicago metropolitan area, were called off. Still, even as the snow tapered off, forecasters said wind chills may fall to 20 to 40 degrees below zero late Wednesday. ""The wind on the lake shore is beyond belief,"" said Chicago resident Anni Glissman. ""It almost knocks you over."" Elsewhere, Illinois State Police carried out a rescue operation in Kankakee County after 20 cars were stranded in the snowstorm, where snowdrifts were measured at about 3 feet, the agency said. The rescued motorists were taken to temporary warming centers in Manteno or Peotone, said state police Sgt. Angie Kinstner. In Wisconsin, the Department of Transportation reported that Interstate 42 and Interstate 94 were impassable south of Milwaukee. The National Guard was making a sweep of the interstates for stranded motorists. On Wednesday night, President Barack Obama approved a request from Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin and approved an emergency disaster declaration for all the state's 77 counties, a move that will expedite post-storm assistance, according to a statement from FEMA.  Fallin had declared a state of emergency on Monday in advance of the storm, a release from the state's Department of Emergency Management said. A 20-year-old Moore, Oklahoma, woman died after hitting her head while sledding during the storm, the statement said. Many others were injured in Oklahoma -- 77 in falls, four in carbon monoxide poisonings, 13 with cuts, 24 in road accidents, two with frostbite and five in other storm-related injuries, according to the state health department. In addition, the state highway patrol responded to 81 storm-related crashes and 278 calls from motorists seeking help. And nationwide, the storm crippled air travel through much of the Midwest and the Northeast, as major carriers cancelled thousands of flights that stranded tens of thousands of passengers. Airports were set to get back on track Thursday, with Amtrak also announcing that service should return to normal then along the Eastern seaboard. The other glimmer of hope came from the world's most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil. Wednesday morning, from his perch right in the middle of the storm track in central Pennsylvania, Phil didn't see his shadow. According to a tradition dating back 100 years, that means spring will come early this year.

1608,"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The central business district of Bangkok dodged severe flooding Saturday afternoon, but surrounding areas of the bustling capital faced further inundation at the next high tide. A dreaded tide on Saturday spurred residents' fears that it would overwhelm defenses along the Chao Phraya River and its many canals. Bangkok's outer suburbs were already submerged, but the central city has been largely spared the misery Thailand has been suffering for months in the nation's worst flooding since 1942. In the east and the north of the city, water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods. But the city -- which sits barely above sea level -- still faces two converging threats. Massive runoff was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok, as high tides pushed the water in the opposite direction. ""The challenge is to manage the huge runoff from the north passing via the city on its way to the Gulf of Thailand,"" a Red Cross bulletin said. Bangkok's Chinatown area -- normally hopping with activity on a Saturday afternoon -- was largely desolate, with few passers-by wading in knee-deep water. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered work crews Friday to cut channels in roadways to allow faster drainage, according to the MCOT news agency. But the plan was rejected late in the day in favor of dredging canals and using pumps, the Bangkok Post reported. Health concerns were rising with the water. Bangkok residents plodded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within, the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials. The government sent out crocodile hunters after reports of crocodiles and snakes in the filthy floodwater. ""We were hearing disturbing reports of dangerous animals such as snakes and crocodiles appearing in the floodwaters, and every day we see children playing in the water, bathing or wading through it trying to make their way to dry ground,"" said Annie Bodmer-Roy, spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency Save the Children. As floodwater entered homes, some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave. Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was going to stay with relatives outside the city. ""Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded,"" said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it also was flooded. ""The water level is 2 meters (six feet) high and smells very bad,"" she said. The Bangkok Post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs, and would pick up residents of the capital on Saturday and take them out of Bangkok. As of Saturday, an estimated 1 million of the city's 12 million residents had left. Another Bangkok resident said she was worried about abandoning her house, which has been flooded for five days, and would not leave. Panic buying has led to a shortage of food and bottled water in the capital, residents said. And the worst might not yet be over. Another high tide -- expected to reach about 4 meters (13 feet) high -- is forecast for Sunday morning. Officials urged tourists to steer clear of Bangkok, while noting that many of the other tourist spots, such as Phuket, remained dry and open for business. Thailand's Ministry of Public Health had transferred 280 of the capital's 520 patients in severe condition to 22 hospitals upcountry, the MCOT news agency reported. The remaining 240 patients will be taken to hospitals in other provinces by Sunday, it said, citing Permanent-Secretary for Health Paichit Varachit. Health Minister Witthaya Buranasiri said that, after months of flooding, 107,101 Thais have been diagnosed with stress, 6,214 with depression and 878 at risk of suicide. In all, 1,356 people were under observation by health officials, the minister said, according to MCOT. The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert on Thursday, recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas. It noted that most tourist destinations, such as Phuket and Chiang Mai, were unaffected. U.S. Ambassador Kristie Kenny said the crisis was slow-moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next. The floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people, . Are you there? Share photos, video but stay safe . The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas. The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide, and more than 113,000 people have taken refuge in them. Overall damage from the floods could exceed $6 billion, the Thai Finance Ministry said. CNN's Sara Sidner, Kocha Olarn, Ivan Cabrera, Moni Basu, Aliza Kassim and Elizabeth Yuan contributed to this report.","Some areas outside of central Bangkok are covered in waist-deep water .

1609,"(CNN) -- At least 40 people were killed and numerous others injured in a reported grenade attack at a casino in Monterrey, Mexico, the capital of Nuevo Leon, according to attorney general in that northern state. The incident occurred around 4 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET) at the Casino Royale when two people aboard a vehicle arrived, and one threw three grenades into the building. There were conflicting unconfirmed reports from local media that the assailants poured gasoline on the building before setting it on fire. Between 20 and 30 people were trapped in the casino because of debris from the explosions, said Cmdr. Angel Flores with the Green Cross. Video from the scene showed a burned-out building as firefighters made rescue attempts to break the wall of the facade of the casino to release the smoke inside the building. Mexican President Felipe Calderon sent the following statement from his official Twitter account (translated from Spanish): ""With deep consternation, I express my solidarity with Nuevo Leon and the victims of this abhorrent act of terror and barbarism."" He added more: ""These reprehensible acts require us all to persevere in the fight against gangs of unscrupulous criminals. All the support to NL (Nuevo Leon)."" About five families were outside the casino waiting for information from authorities, local journalist Javier Estrada reported. Gustavo Madrazo was one of those waiting outside the casino. He said his wife, Martha, and her sister, Miriam Gonzalez, were inside. Authorities have not identified any of the victims. So far, no representative for the company that manages the casino had arrived outside. The Mexican Army and state and municipal police forces were also on the scene. Alejandro Poire, Mexico's top national security spokesman, said the federal government has made contact with local officials and that Calderon has spoken to the governor of Nuevo Leon to offer support. Poire said those who carried out the attacks will be held responsible. ""They will pay for their crimes. ... We will do absolutely everything ... to restore tranquility."" The National Commission on Human Rights in Mexico sent a news release saying it has opened an investigation regarding the response to the events at the casino. ""The priority is to help safeguard the human rights enshrined in the Constitution of the United Mexican States and international treaties. The commission again makes clear that the insecurity in the country requires public officials responsible for implementing and enforcing the law, carry out preventive actions to protect society and away from any violence."" ""The National Commission will monitor the actions taken by the competent authorities to respond adequately to the aggrieved persons."" The NHRC says it has also sent personnel to the scene including physicians, psychologists and lawyers to work jointly with authorities. Nuevo Leon, in northeastern Mexico, has seen several grenade attacks so far this year. On August 13, four civilians were wounded when an armed group fired two grenades at a jail in the municipality of Apodaca. In July, gunmen entered a downtown bar in Monterrey and shot 20 people dead. A public safety spokesman told CNN the attack was likely sparked by a dispute between organized crime groups for control of the El Sabino Gordo nightclub, where drugs were allegedly sold. Nuevo Leon and the neighboring states of Coahuila and Tamaulipas have been the scene of a series of clashes between organized crime groups. The Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas are vying for control of trafficking routes into the United States. In November 2010, the federal government launched the Coordinated Operation Northeast, which involves sending more security forces to the area to tackle crime.

1610,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A blast at a busy market in northwest Pakistan killed at least 35 people and wounded more than 60 Tuesday, an official said. The explosion occurred in the Jamrud Market in the Khyber Agency, one of seven districts in Pakistan's volatile tribal region, which borders Afghanistan. The bomb was placed in a vehicle belonging to a local militia group fighting against militants in the area, said Jameel Khan, a government official. The bomb was then remotely detonated, he said, citing the initial investigation. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad condemned the bombing.

1611,"(CNN) -- The son of Green Bay Packers offensive coordinator Joe Philbin died from ""fresh water drowning"" and there was no evidence of foul play, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, police said Wednesday. The body of Michael Philbin, 21, was pulled from a river Monday, a day after he went missing while in Oshkosh to visit friends, police said. Toxicology results from the autopsy, conducted Tuesday, will not be available for several weeks, according to a police statement. ""We love Michael so much and will miss him dearly,"" Joe Philbin said in a statement released Tuesday afternoon. ""He loved his family, friends and life. His memory will live on in the hearts and minds of all who knew him."" Philbin thanked the agencies that assisted in the search and expressed gratitude for ""the prayers and the support of our family, friends and the Packers family."" On behalf of the team, Packers general manager Ted Thompson said everyone's thoughts and prayers were with the family. ""This is an emotional and difficult time for them, and we ask that everyone respect their privacy,"" he said. ""All of us in the Packers family share in their grief."" The body was found Monday in the Fox River after Oshkosh police put out an alert asking citizens for help locate Philbin, who lived about 20 miles away in Ripon. His last known communication was at 2 a.m. Sunday, police said. ""He talked to a friend. He didn't sound like he was under duress or he had any medical condition,"" police spokesman Joe Nichols told CNN affiliate WTMJ on Monday. ""The phone conversation ended, and that was the last time someone had voice contact."" Michael Philbin was the second-eldest of six children of Joe Philbin and his wife, Diane, according to the Packers' website. His funeral is set for Friday. His father coached for 19 years at college football programs before coming to Green Bay in 2003 as an assistant offensive line coach. He became the team's offensive coordinator in 2007 and played a significant part in the Packers' league-best 15-1 regular season record this season.

1612,"Dallas (CNN) -- Severe weather hit the Houston area Monday, flooding streets and homes and leaving thousands of people without power, emergency officials said. Torrential rain fell across the area, causing flash flooding that left streets and highways impassable and submerged some vehicles. ""We have a lot of roadways closed, and some evacuations are going on,"" said Alan Spears of the Fort Bend County office of emergency management. In the city of Richmond, rescues were conducted by boat and on foot. Spears said he believes a tornado touched down in the area. ""We had 7,000 people without power in the county,"" he said. iReport: Are you there? Send in your stories, videos, photos . Sixty miles southeast, in Texas City, a law enforcement officer witnessed what appeared to be a tornado strike near the Mall of Midland, the National Weather Service reported. The Houston/Galveston weather forecast office will examine the area and two other reported areas on Tuesday to confirm reported strikes, said Timothy Oram, an emergency response meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. As much as 6.3 inches of rain had fallen in the past day, nearly all of it during the previous 12 hours, Oram said late Monday afternoon. At Houston Hobby Airport, 4.05 inches of rain fell, which douses the previous January 9 record of 2.54 inches set in 1955, according to Oram. Though flash flood warnings were still in effect for Chambers County and Galveston County, the worst was over, he said. ""It's moved off to the northeast; things should be improving here,"" he told CNN. Video from Fort Bend County showed wind damage, including debris from building roofs and broken glass, and people trapped by the storm described terrifying moments. One resident said he felt the wind pushing into his home just before the garage door fell in and the front door of his home was blown open. ""It just kept getting louder and louder and louder,"" Umair Sayyed told CNN affiliate KPRC. Sayyed said he and his mother and sister sheltered inside a closet moments before the roof fell and rain poured into his home. Michael Walter, spokesman for the Houston Office of Emergency Management, said the city conducted 20 to 30 high-water rescues. The rain was falling so hard and fast in Houston that the weather service recorded 1.6 inches in just 10 minutes. No injuries were reported.

1613,"(CNN) -- A final autopsy report released Wednesday shows that Florida A&M University drum major Robert D. Champion suffered muscle damage commonly seen in such events as car accidents, prolonged seizures, child abuse and torture, an expert said. The alleged fatal beating suffered last month by Champion, 26, during a marching band hazing must have been brutal, two experts said. ""His muscles were beaten so badly that they were destroyed like you would see in a heart attack,"" Dr. Howard Oliver, a forensic pathologist who is a former deputy medical examiner in the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, told CNN after reviewing the autopsy findings. Band bus a complex crime scene, expert says . The damaged muscles leaked out a protein called myoglobin, ""and it's too much for the kidneys to process. It causes the kidneys to fail,"" which results in death, Oliver said. The muscle damage is called rhabdomyolysis, Oliver said. ""Most of the time it's in (car) accidents or in people who freeze to death, and you get it in a lot of people who have prolonged seizures or in people who are in extreme physical activity like running in a marathon,"" Oliver said. ""You see it in torture or child abuse and severe burns when the muscles get damaged."" In the case of seizures or freezing to death, people ""shiver and it really works the muscles over a long period of time, and it damages them, and they release the protein,"" Oliver said. Lawrence Kobilinsky, professor of forensic science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said the beating must have been severe. ""This kid took a real beating over his body,"" Kobilinsky told CNN after reviewing the autopsy report. ""They're saying that the beating was so powerful, it just squashed the tissue. ""These are extremely forceful blows that this kid took, all over his back and his arms and his shoulders. It's kind of like in Egypt where they beat up that poor woman yesterday,"" Kobilinsky said Wednesday. ""It's interesting that there is no trauma to the neck or no trauma to the head. It's interesting that they are avoiding those areas,"" Kobilinsky said of the people who delivered the beating. Added Oliver: ""They just pummeled him."" Had they aimed for his abdomen, ""he would have bled to death."" The autopsy was performed by Associate Medical Examiner Sara H. Irrgang of Florida's District 9 Medical Examiner's Office in Orlando, with oversight from Chief Medical Examiner Jan C. Garavaglia. That office serves Orange and Osceola counties. The complete autopsy report follows a press release issued last week by the medical examiner's office that called Champion's death a homicide. The medical examiners said in that statement that Champion died November 19 because of ""hemorrhagic shock"" -- the result of excessive internal bleeding -- ""due to soft tissue hemorrhage, due to blunt force trauma sustained during a hazing incident."" Champion collapsed in Orlando on a bus carrying members of the Florida A&M Marching 100 band after a football game that included a halftime performance by the band. Christopher Chestnut, the lawyer for Champion's family, has charged that Champion died after receiving ""some dramatic blows, perhaps (having an) elevated heart rate"" tied to ""a hazing ritual"" that took place on the bus. Some band members have said Champion died after taking part in a rite of passage called ""crossing Bus C."" One member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that students ""walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus backward while the bus is full of other band members, and you get beaten until you get to the back."" No one has been charged in Champion's death; the Orange County Sheriff's Office is investigating the case. The medical examiner's office said last week that Champion ""collapsed and died within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body."" The autopsy conducted after his death found ""extensive contusions of his chest, arms, shoulder and back,"" as well as ""evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat"" -- which is the fatty tissue directly under a person's skin. Champion didn't have any bone fractures or injuries to his internal organs. The medical examiner didn't find any evidence of ""natural disease except for a slightly enlarged heart,"" nor did toxicology tests reveal signs of drugs or alcohol.","Medical examiner releases complete autopsy report of FAMU's Robert D.

1614,"Cairo (CNN) -- Six people were killed and at least 300 were injured when pro-democracy activists clashed Friday with Egyptian security forces in central Cairo, a government official said. Two of the dead were teenagers and one was an Islamic scholar, said Dr. Hisham Shiha, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health. At least four of the fatalities suffered gunshot wounds, with one person shot in the back of the head, he said. Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the general prosecutor, said an investigation is under way. ""We are questioning 14 men detained at scene of clashes and we have a team now at two hospitals questioning the injured to understand how the injuries were inflicted,"" he said. A separate team was at the morgues following up on the deaths, he said. Meanwhile, people were throwing Molotov cocktails, rocks and glass. Men wearing what appeared to be military uniforms tossed bricks and concrete on protesters from atop a six-story building. A Ministry of Transportation building burned nearby, and tents in an activist encampment in front of parliament caught fire. The military fired warning shots into the air and sprayed water cannons to disperse the crowd. Shiha said nearly 100 people were hurt, including nine who were shot by live ammunition. Saeed said 12 people were charged with destroying public property. Are you in Cairo? Tell us what the mood is like. A Ministry of Interior official denied police were involved. ""This situation has nothing to do with the police or the Ministry of Interior, and we do not have forces at the site of the clashes,"" said Gen. Marwan Mustapha, a ministry spokesman. A doctor at a clinic said he had treated dozens of protesters for cuts and injuries caused by flying glass and rocks. ""It all started when the military arrested one man, and then an hour later he emerged from building barely able to walk from the beating,"" said activist and video blogger Walid Nada. ""His face and body and clothes (were) blotched with blood as the protesters carried him to (a) makeshift hospital."" Activist Mona Seif identified the beaten man as Aboudi Ibrahim. He ""has no broken bones, but major bruises to the face, cuts and harsh burns from electric shockers. We are filling a police report soon,"" she said.

1615,"Waterville, Maine (CNN) -- Divers in Maine were scouring a river Wednesday in their search for a missing 21-month-old girl, but had found no sign of her in the frigid waters, authorities said. ""We're making progress. I can tell you honestly that as the days go on, our concern grows, as it's been 26 days. But I can also tell you that we remain hopeful that we will bring her back to her home,"" Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland told reporters. The search for Ayla Reynolds focused Wednesday on a half-mile area of the Kennebec River that stretches from downtown Waterville to the Carter Memorial Bridge. Officials said they had received more than 600 tips, but nothing that specifically pointed to that area. The river still has open water despite air temperatures in the teens. Divers in special suits to protect them in the frigid waters rotated in and out of the river, which was around freezing temperature, Maine Warden Service Lt. Kevin Adam said. ""The water is clear. When the sun is out, they can see 4-6 feet. ... We picked today because the weather's good and it was the most efficient time to do it,"" he said. The search for the little girl is in its fourth week. Police have said they suspect foul play in the case. ""All we know is that Ayla's missing. We've ruled out no scenario. We've ruled out no one. And we're not going to get into investigative details,"" McCausland said Wednesday. He described the search as the most intense investigation Maine's state police had been involved in for two decades. Ayla's parents are not married and don't live together. Her mother recently completed rehab, family members said. Investigators said both families have cooperated with police. The little girl's father, Justin DiPietro, said he put his daughter to bed at 8 p.m. December 16 and called police the next morning just before 9 a.m. to report her missing, according to authorities. DiPietro's mother, Phoebe DiPietro, told CNN she wasn't at the home the night Ayla disappeared. But she said she fully supports her son, who has said he ""would never do anything to harm"" his daughter. She said she just wants her Ayla returned unharmed. ""I'd give everything I owned if we can have her back,"" she said last week, her voice breaking.

1616,"(CNN) -- Japan's 77-year-old emperor is currently in hospital, several days after coming down with a fever, a spokesperson with the Imperial Household Agency says. Emperor Akihito, a ceremonial but revered figure in the Japan, was suffering from a worsening case of bronchitis and the fever he contracted Thursday, according to the spokesperson, who declined to be identified due to the agency's media protocol. ""He appears to be fatigued and has lost some resistance to fight against sickness,"" the spokesperson said. ""To be on the safe side, he was hospitalized (Sunday night) at University of Tokyo Hospital."" It is the emperor's second time in a hospital this year, after getting medical treatment in February for extensive tests of his coronary arteries. In recent years some analysts believe Akihito's health has been affected by stress. The issues of no male heir for Crown Prince Naruhito, the continued talk of constitutional changes for females to rule and family rifts over the role of the Imperial Household Agency were speculated to be the cause. Tsugunomiya Akihito was born on December 23, 1933 in Tokyo to Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako Kuniat as their fifth child and first son. According to Japanese legend, he is a direct descendant of Japan's first emperor Jimmu, circa 660 BC. Akihito means ""shining pinnacle of virtue,"" and Tsugunomiya means ""prince of the august succession and enlightened benevolence."" At about the age of five, Akihito was separated from his parents, in accordance with Japanese custom at the time, and raised and educated by chamberlains and tutors. His youth was packed with events so dramatic that they today seem unimaginable, including Japan's brutal military invasion of China, its foray into World War II and subsequent defeat followed by an unprecedented foreign occupation. Akihito's post WWII private tutor was an American Quaker, Elizabeth Gray-Vining from Philadelphia, who also happened to be the only foreign guest at his wedding. Married to Michiko Shoda in 1959, he was the first Japanese crown prince to marry a commoner (they met playing tennis), despite the fact there was a designated list of about 800 potential candidates. The marriage produced three children; Hiro no miya Naruhito Shinno, Crown Prince Naruhito (born February 23, 1960), Akishino no miya Fumihito Shinno, Prince Akishino (born November 30, 1965), and Nori no miya Sayako Naishinno, Princess Sayako (born April 8, 1969). On November 12, 1990, Akihito ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne -- the oldest hereditary monarchy in the world -- as the 125th Emperor of Japan, one year and ten months after the death of Emperor Hirohito. The position, per Japan's constitution, is defined as ""the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people."" That said, the office's involvement in day-to-day government affairs tends to be minimal. Akihito broke from precedent following Japan's epic 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami earlier this year, when he gave a historic, televised speech on March 16. In it, he encouraged citizens to put forth their ""best effort to save all suffering people"" and he applauded his countrymen's handling of the crisis. ""I truly hope the victims of the disaster never give up hope, take care of themselves, and live strong for tomorrow,"" he said in a calm and poignant oration delivered from the Imperial Palace. ""Also, I want all citizens of Japan to remember everyone who has been affected by the devastation, not only today but for a long time afterwards -- and help with the recovery.""

1617,"(CNN) -- The man Chilean authorities accuse of sparking a wildfire that has consumed more than 31,000 acres of a national park said Sunday that he is innocent. ""It is very important to me to say that this wasn't me (who started the fire). They dropped the case on me,"" Rotem Zinger told Israeli army radio. The 23-year-old Israeli national said he was surprised by the way the case against him has unfolded. ""I was not explained what I was accused of. I did not give a testimony. I did not confess. Things rolled out the wrong way through mistranslation. I never intended to admit the blame,"" he said. Zinger is accused of lighting a fire in a prohibited area of the protected Torres del Paine National Park in southern Chile, regional prosecutor Juan Agustin Melendez said. Prosecutors also accuse him of making the situation worse by not reporting to authorities that the fire got out of his control. If convicted, Zinger could face a fine and 41 to 60 days in prison, Melendez told CNN Chile. Zinger will be required to stay in the region during an investigation, the prosecutor said. Authorities will be looking into what caused the wildfire for months, Melendez said. Fierce flames have kept investigators from reaching the location where the fire started, he added. The wildfire has been burning since Tuesday. Hundreds of firefighters are battling the blaze, but authorities have said they don't know when the fire will be under control. High winds stoke the flames for most of the week, though rains in the area Saturday gave firefighters some help. ""We could be talking about a week. We could be talking about a month or more,"" said Hugo Knockaert, chief of fire management for Chile's National Forest Corporation. CNN's Guy Azriel, Claudia Dominguez and CNN Chile contributed to this report.","""Things rolled out the wrong way through mistranslation,"" Rotem Zinger tells Israeli radio .

1618,"(CNN) -- Prosecutors are investigating police actions during a protest earlier this month in which at least 16 people died, the Office of the General Prosecutor in Kazakhstan said Thursday. At least 80 people were also injured in the December 16 clashes between police and striking oil workers in the oil town of Zhanaozen, according to state media. A 20-day state of emergency was declared following the unrest, which also spilled over to a nearby village, where at least one person died as protesters blocked a passenger train in a show of support for the oil workers. A spokeswoman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Virginie Coulloudon, said Kazakhstan had told fellow OSCE states Tuesday that the general prosecutor's office had started its own inquiry into police actions. Kazakh authorities said the internal security department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs had also launched an in-house investigation into claims of firearms use by the police, Coulloudon said. ""The conclusions of this investigation, according to Kazakh sources, should be available within a week,"" she told CNN via email. The Kazakh general prosecutor's office said in a statement on its website Thursday that 20 people had been detained over involvement in the unrest in Zhanaozen, with 18 of the arrests ordered by the court. A criminal case was opened Tuesday into the alleged excessive use of force by police who opened fire, it said, but some of the deaths reported from Zhanaozen were not related to the actions of law enforcement. The investigation will be headed by a special prosecutor in order to guarantee its objectivity and measures have been adopted to ensure transparency, the statement said. A separate committee has also been formed, with relatives of those detained among its members, to examine claims of unlawful detention and abuse of detainees, it said. At least one person is being investigated for giving ""false information"" to the media about events in Zhanaozen, the prosecutor's office added. The trouble came as the former Soviet republic celebrated its 20th anniversary of independence and prompted concern that unrest might spread across the oil rich Central Asian nation. The protest was part of a long-running dispute over low pay and the sacking of some workers. Video posted to YouTube appeared to show protesters in Zhanaozen fleeing a large square amid gunfire, as police advance with riot shields. An injured person is seen being beaten with a baton by what appears to be a policeman. The workers' trade union puts the number of dead at 50 to 70 and says as many as 500 were injured, according to European lawmakers. International rights groups have condemned the violence and subsequent emergency measures imposed by the government, including curbs on communications and freedom of movement, and called for a full investigation. The U.S. State Department and a group of 48 European lawmakers also expressed concern. The Kazakh authorities announced Wednesday that 1 million Kazakh tenge ($6,640) would be paid to the families of each of those killed and half that sum to those injured. Analysts say the Kazakh government is keen to prevent discontent over increasing social inequality, in a country where most ordinary people have not shared in the wealth brought by oil. Parliamentary and local elections are due to take place next month. Kazakhstan has often boasted of its stability in a region that has seen its share of conflict. The ninth-largest country in the world by area, it has the largest economy of all the Central Asian states thanks mostly to its natural resources, according to the CIA World Factbook.

1619,"(CNN) -- The bodies of 11 more people have been recovered after the weekend collapse of a Russian oil rig in freezing north Pacific waters, a Russian news agency reported Monday. That brings the total number of dead from the Sunday disaster to 16, according to the state news agency RIA-Novosti. There were 67 people aboard the offshore drilling rig when it capsized during a storm in the Sea of Okhotsk, which lies between the Kamchatka peninsula and the Russian mainland, north of Japan. The rig was being towed from Kamchatka at the time, RIA-Novosti reported. Fourteen people have been rescued and 37 others remain missing, the news agency said. The director of the company that owns the rig, Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka, promised at least 3 million rubles ($93,640) in compensation to each crewmember's family. The rig was carrying out work under a contract with Russian energy giant Gazprom, the news agency said. It was drilling a well about 3,500 meters (11,480 feet) deep, RIA-Novosti said. Taimuraz Kasayev, a spokesman for the regional emergencies service, told RIA-Novosti on Sunday the accident poses no environmental danger because the rig's fuel stocks were hermetically sealed and would not spill. The television channel Russia Today reported that the rig was being towed into position when pumps failed, causing it to take on water and sink.","NEW: The bodies bring the death toll to 16 .

1620,"(CNN) -- A motorcycle competitor has died the first stage of this year's Dakar Rally in Argentina Sunday. Jorge Martinez Boero was only two kilometers from the finish of the 57km special from Mar del Plata to Santa Rosa when he came off his Beta bike with tragic results. Organizers said the 38-year-old from Argentina, who was taking part in the annual event for the second time, suffered a cardiac arrest after his fall. He was treated by medical staff within five minutes of the accident, but died on the way to hospital. In a statement on the official website of the endurance rally, organizers sent their ""heartfelt condolences to his family and loved one's."" Boero's death was the 21st involving a competitor during the event, which was started in 1979 as the Paris-Dakar rally. It finished in the Senegal capital for 29 times until the organizers brought the event to South America in 2009. This year's event covers 9,000 kilometers and takes in Argentina, Peru and Chile. Cars, motorcycles and trucks compete in their various categories over a series of grueling special stages on difficult terrain. Chilean Francisco Lopez won the opening stage of the motorbike section as the Aprilia rider covered the 57km course in 32 minutes 37seconds.

1623,"Rio De Janeiro (CNN) -- The death toll from devastating flooding in Brazil continued to climb Tuesday, surpassing 700, the government said. A helicopter rescued 18 people from a city in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state after rains caused devastating flooding and mudslides in the mountainous region. Four children -- including a 30-day-old baby, were among those lifted to safety Monday. The Air Force said one of them -- 6-year-old Guilherme Carvalho -- summed up the feelings of the group with a simple exclamation: ""Relief!"" But rescuers have not been able to reach some hard-hit areas, and many more people are feared dead. Forecasters predict rain will continue for several days in areas already submerged in water. The death toll from flooding in Rio de Janeiro state has climbed to 710, according to government figures released Tuesday. And thousands are homeless across the state. Other states in the South American country have also seen heavy rainfall. Last week, authorities in neighboring Sao Paulo state said 24 people had been killed by flooding. In Rio de Janeiro state, flooding and mudslides turned the once-picturesque tourist town of Teresopolis into a wasteland. Bodies and belongings remained strewn amongst fallen boulders Monday as family members searched for loved ones in the rubble. Outside a makeshift morgue in Teresopolis -- where the government said at least 292 people had died in flooding -- a crowd of people waited for their turn to identify loved ones. Marco Antonio Siqueira Costa said the last time he saw his brother, sister-in-law and niece was a few days ago, before mud buried their house. ""I think that last meeting was God's way of granting us a farewell,"" he said. Residents in the city donned masks and helped clean streets or deliver first aid. Others combed the city searching desperately for missing loved ones. Meanwhile, experts and officials tried to pinpoint what caused the catastrophe. ""Combine a weather event and environmental irresponsibility and the sum equals a tragedy,"" said Carlos Minc, Rio de Janeiro's environment minister. Minc said he wants to stop construction of homes in high-risk areas, such as river banks or steep mountain slopes -- a practice that he said was encouraged by previous governments. He pointed to Nova Friburgo -- the hardest-hit city, according to government figures, which list 335 deaths due to flooding there. ""We are monitoring river levels, but it isn't enough. In Nova Friburgo, for example, we had warned six hours in advance that the river was overflowing, but...there is no emergency plan or drills with the population so they know what to do in a situation like this,"" he said. Brazilian authorities have been criticized for a lack of disaster planning, and for allowing people to build homes in areas known to become treacherous in the rainy season. They are under increasing pressure to show a strong response. Brazil is scheduled to host the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016.

1624,"(CNN) -- Struck by lightning, caught up in the smell of gas, braving two-inch hail and relentless rain: None of it could stop hundreds of firefighters, police officers, medical personnel, National Guardsmen and more from heading into the devastation around Joplin, Missouri, in a desperate search for survivors. Nor could the fact that many of the first responders searched through the rubble of buildings at the same time many of their own homes had been eviscerated. Amidst the struggles, there were victories: 17 people were rescued Monday, city manager Mark Rohr told CNN's Eliot Spitzer. ""They've lost their homes, but they have been out there for 40 hours saving lives,"" Richard Serino, deputy administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said from Joplin. ""The work they have done ... to say it is to be commended is an understatement."" Not much more than 12 hours after the tornado touched down, Rohr said that between 400 to 500 firefighters, public works personnel and other municipal employees showed up Monday morning, unasked, hoping to help. The city manager said that the turnout, and the fact many others who have pitched in in other ways, is no surprise in Joplin, a city of 50,050 residents in southwest Missouri. ""Joplin is a city of neighbors helping neighbors,"" he said. ""And with this spirit, we will overcome the hardship."" Yet the continually confounding weather Monday proved a major challenge. Rohr said that two first responders were struck by lightning while looking through debris -- he did not detail the victims' conditions afterward -- with persistent thunderstorms prompting a temporary halt to the searches. And even by Monday evening, a full day after the twister struck, Rohr said there were ""gas leaks all over the city."" ""When we drive around, we can smell the gas,"" the city manager said. ""And there are wires down everywhere. You have just got to be careful, as you navigate through the city."" The challenge doesn't appear likely to get any easier Tuesday. The National Weather Service has said there is a 45 percent chance of another tornado outbreak between 4 p.m. and midnight Tuesday over a wide swath that includes cities like Dallas, Oklahoma City and -- yet again -- Joplin. Those assisting in the rescue effort weren't just from Joplin. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon noted that some of the more than 1,000 first responders came from Kansas City and other locales. That doesn't include the 110 highway patrolmen and 250 National Guardsmen -- with another 450 on standby -- also on the scene. Dr. Jim Roscoe told CNN that doctors, nurses and others rushed to help, after the tornado ripped through St. John's Regional Medical Center. Even with often impassible roads and treacherous weather, he said that, ""within a matter of hours, we had almost more help than we could put to use."" ""I just can't begin to tell you,"" said Roscoe, who is heading the hospital's triage unit as it treats and redirects patients coming in for help. ""We've had people coming from several hundreds of miles away, grabbing their stethoscope and anything they could get, and threw it in their car and came."" Whether treating patients and searching for bodies, those on the frontlines in Joplin also face a significant psychological toll of dealing with devastation that most of them have never seen before. Nixon said they would likely have ""very difficult shifts, (because) there are going to see things out there that are hard to see and hard to stomach."" Still, voicing a sentiment echoed by officials and residents in Joplin, the governor said it wouldn't prevent the first responders from heading out again, looking for survivors. ""We are going to cover every foot of this town, and we're going to make sure that every person is accounted for,"" Nixon said.","Hundreds hit the streets of Joplin, despite thunderstorms, looking for tornado survivors .

1625,"(CNN) -- A Russian tanker carrying fuel arrived in the Alaskan town of Nome on Saturday night, the Coast Guard said, as officials started preparations on delivering the much-needed supplies. U.S Coast Guard ice breaker Cutter Healy accompanied the fuel tanker Renda as it made its way through the frozen waters carrying 1.3 million gallons of petroleum products. ""The first step is to ensure the ice is safe for the personnel to walk on,"" said Chief Petty Officer Kip Wadlow. ""Then they will work to connect the piping and check for leaks. Safety is our primary concern."" The cutter has broken through almost 300 miles of ice for the tanker on a journey that took them through southern Alaska's Aleutian Islands. The voyage is the first-ever attempt to supply fuel to an Arctic Alaska settlement through sea ice. A company in Nome contracted the Renda to deliver the fuel after ice formed over the Bering Sea following a ferocious November storm that prevented the last delivery of the season via barge. The Coast Guard urged Nome residents not to go out on the ice to watch the operations, saying the behavior of the ice is unpredictable and ice conditions could change. Nome is not in immediate danger of running out of fuel, said Coast Guard Capt. Craig Lloyd, who is coordinating the mission. The town has enough fuel to last until about March, but the delivery was attempted now because it would have been more difficult then, he said.

1626,"(CNN) -- At least three tornadoes caused massive damage in Virginia and injured more than 200 people on Monday, officials said. This Suffolk, Virginia, house was destroyed by an apparent tornado Monday. At least 200 were injured in Suffolk where a twister destroyed several homes and businesses, said Bob Spieldenner of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. The storm hit the 138-bed Sentara Obici Hospital, though Spieldenner said the facility was still operational and accepting patients. A second tornado struck Colonial Heights -- about 60 miles northwest, near Richmond -- injuring at least 18 people, he said. A third twister damaged several homes near Lawrenceville, about 70 miles south of Richmond, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, which confirmed all three tornadoes. Gov. Tim Kaine declared a Virginia-wide state of emergency as hazardous weather continued through the central part of the state. The Suffolk twister touched down just before 4 p.m. ET and plowed its way east into Norfolk, damaging scores of homes, stores and cars and downing dozens of trees and power lines, Jackson said.

1627,"(CNN) -- Mammoth cruise ships can be difficult to get around, even in the best of circumstances. In the worst -- which is how one might describe the situation aboard the listing Costa Concordia -- they are near impossible. Yet even before the sun rose Monday, about 120 rescue personnel were out in or around the liner that hit rocks near Tuscany and rolled spectacularly on its side. They were in a race against time, and in a battle with numerous challenges, to try to save survivors or at least recover the bodies of the passengers and crew members who are still missing. Overheard on CNN.com: Worst-case scenario . The search was temporarily suspended by noon Monday, after authorities said the vessel had begun to sway, making it dangerous for the crews. But it resumed a short time later, despite a forecast calling for increasingly strong winds that Coast Guard spokesman Filippo Marino said had rescuers worried. They are ""working in very, very bad conditions,"" said Luciano Roncalli of Italy's national fire service. ""It's cold, of course. It's dark during the day and the night. ... It's really, really dangerous."" Authorities have said that at least six people died after the Costa Concordia hit rocks Friday night off the tiny island of Giglio, where nighttime temperatures have recently dipped below freezing. A total of 29 people -- four crew members and 25 passengers -- are still unaccounted for from the listing cruise ship, Italian coast guard chief Marco Brusco said Monday, according to Italy's ANSA news agency. That figure includes two of the 120 Americans who were aboard the ship, the U.S. Embassy in Italy said. Now turned on its side, the ship is roughly half-submerged. Rescuers hope is that any survivor has found refuge above water, or perhaps in an air pocket, and can be brought out alive. ""There could still be people locked into compartments ... where they can't physically move because of the twisting of the metal,"" said Butch Hendrick, president of the diving safety company Lifeguard Systems. In its current state, the Costa Concordia resembles a dark, convoluted cave -- with its countless nooks and crannies and few ways to easily escape. Six underwater cave rescue divers are working among the rescue personnel. The divers are likely equipped with twice as much oxygen as regular scuba divers, have a guideline nearby in case they need help finding a way back to safety, and have knives and whatever lights they can carry or wear, said Robert Laird, a co-founder of the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery group. Still, whatever equipment and precautions they take, ""what they are doing is extremely difficult,"" he said. ""If you do not have the right frame of mind to deal with being in the dark and in tight closed spaces, then you're (in trouble),"" said Laird, who has dived in many caves and ships, though neither he nor his group are involved in the Italian operation. Unlike open water divers, these divers don't have the luxury of coming up for air anytime they want, and they can't count on the help of sunlight. Laird said he expects that, besides being pitch-black, the water in the ship teems with debris. ""They could swim right by a dead body and not even see it,"" Laird said. Rescuers are navigating a seeming labyrinth. The Concordia is practically a skyscraper in two directions: 17 decks high and 951 feet long. Emergency personnel are aiming to look into 1,500 cabins and all around the ship's many other public spaces, including eight bars, five restaurants, four swimming pools, a casino and more. Hendrick, a veteran of many such rescue dives, estimated it could take a couple of weeks for the whole ship to be checked. ""It's enormous,"" said Richard Bordoni, another member of the Italian national fire corps. ""They have to stay safe, and it takes them a long time to go down a corridor."" Late Sunday, the cruise line said the ship's captain may have made ""significant"" errors leading to the wreck and subsequent rescue effort. ""The route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,"" Costa Cruises said in a statement. Authorities told ANSA that the captain, Francesco Schettino, has been detained for alleged manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board. Speaking on Italian television, Schettino insisted the rocks were not marked on his map. ""On the nautical chart, it was marked just as water,"" Schettino said, adding that the ship was about 300 meters (1,000 feet) from shore. But the Italian coast guard insisted that the waters where the ship ran aground were well-mapped. Local fishermen say the island coast of Giglio is known for its rocky sea floor. ""Every danger in this area is on the nautical chart,"" Coast Guard Capt. Cosimo Nicastro said. ""This is a place where a lot of people come for diving and sailing. ... All the dangers are known."" Survivors recounted a frantic rush by passengers to get on lifeboats, while the crew appeared helpless and unable to cope. ""It was the Marx brothers, watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat,"" said passenger Benji Smith, recounting how he made his own rope ladder to save himself and his wife. ""I felt like the disaster itself was manageable, but I felt like the crew was going to kill us."" Compounding the evacuation problems was that only one side of the boat's lifeboats was available, as the ship was listing. Passenger Laurie Willits, from Ontario, Canada, said some lifeboats on the higher side got stuck, leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the sounds of children crying and screaming. ""It was so crowded, and there was no room for us,"" said Brandon Warrick, who was sailing with his siblings. ""It was just bad, like mad scrambles to get into the lifeboats. Nobody followed any procedure."" Many questions remain: Why was the ship -- with about 3,000 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- so close in to shore in an area where the seabed is pockmarked with rocks? What happened in the minutes after the ship ran aground? Why was no ""mayday"" distress signal sent? ""Looking at the pictures of the damage, it almost looks as if they saw it at the last minute, and they tried to swing the ship to the right to miss,"" said Chris McKesson, professor of naval architecture at the University of New Orleans. Whatever happened to cause the crash, what's happening now to deal with its aftermath -- and, ideally, get to those still on board -- is now the focus. Those rescue crews have to deal with not just myriad logistical difficulties, but also physical and mental challenges. Emergency personnel in the open-air part of the ship need ropes to get around, because the floor has become the wall in most cases. Whether they are rappelling or swimming, doors may have to be opened upward, not the standard way, given the position of the ship. ""The doors are very heavy, and the windows are very thick, so it's quite difficult to break them,"" said Roncalli of the national fire service. Making one's way around without light and where everything is turned on its side can test even the toughest person's mental makeup. Laird, of the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery group, notes that many cave diver deaths ""are attributed to panic."" Even those not underwater face situations in which even a small slip-up can be life threatening, he said. Despite such challenges, Roncalli vowed that rescue personnel were prepared and intent on continuing their mission as long as necessary. ""They keep on working until we are sure that no person is missing,"" he said. ""The conditions are very tough, but we can manage it.""","NEW: The rescue/recovery operation on the ship could take weeks, a diving expert says .

1628,"(CNN) -- The main airport in St. Louis is expected to operate a full flight schedule Tuesday, less than four days after a powerful tornado tore through the facility, airport officials said. But restoration efforts are far from over at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, where the Friday night storm shattered windows and ripped off part of a roof. ""It obviously just took a couple of minutes for the damage to occur,"" Airport Director Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""It will take weeks, maybe a couple of months, to clean up all of it."" Still, Hamm-Niebruegge said efforts to get the facility up and running again have been ""miraculous."" American Airlines returned to service on Monday, officials said, leaving only Cape Air among the airport's 13 airlines still out of service because of storm damage. Cape Air will resume flights on Tuesday, airport officials said in a statement Monday evening. American and Cape Air were among the hardest hit after the storm, which devastated the airport's C concourse. The tornado damaged 750 homes near the airport, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said. And preliminary National Weather Service estimates released Saturday show the tornado packed winds between 111 and 165 miles per hour when it hit the airport. There were no fatalities reported -- a fact that Nixon characterized as ""absolutely amazing."" At the airport, Hamm-Niebruegge said the facility's design -- and the way people responded to warnings -- played a key role. ""It is a historic building, and it's built very, very well. I think that had a part to do with it, but we also had very early warnings,"" she said. Besides damage to homes and the airport, the strong winds also hit businesses and tore through the roof of a Ferguson, Missouri church, where dozens had gathered on Good Friday to watch the movie ""Passion of the Christ."" Officials have said inspections of buildings will take several days and hauling off debris will take longer. Elsewhere in Missouri, storms over the weekend left behind water on the runways at a regional airport, forcing authorities to shut down the facility temporarily. The Cape Girardeau Regional Airport, located about 100 miles south of St. Louis, has been shut down since Sunday, administrative coordinator Katrina Atkins said. Crews were activating a pumping system to remove the standing water Monday, she said, but authorities had not determined when the airport would reopen. CNN's Tom Laabs contributed to this report.

1629,"(CNN) -- Vehicles began streaming across the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge early Tuesday -- a day ahead of schedule -- after the completion of repairs to a crack in the structure's east span. Commuters make the trek across the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge after it reopened Tuesday. Commuters began driving over the bridge around 6:40 a.m. PT (9:40 a.m. ET), shortly after Randy Iwasaki, director of the California Department of Transportation, announced the reopening at a news conference. ""The bridge has been inspected, and it is safer than when we closed it on Friday,"" Iwasaki said. Over the weekend, crews began repairing a ""significant crack"" that was found on the east span of the bridge during a planned closure for another project. The target time for reopening had been early Wednesday, but crews worked nonstop overnight to repair the eyebar beam, Iwasaki said. He thanked motorists for being patient. ""I know it's been trying. I received a few e-mail notes,"" the official said. Iwasaki said some closures or detours near the bridge would remain in place a while longer, including those along northbound and southbound Interstate 880. About 280,000 vehicles cross the landmark bridge every day, according to the department. The Bay Bridge was closed last week as part of a seismic retrofitting project that required cutting out and replacing a double-deck portion of the east span.  Watch as the bridge needed big repairs » . A 50-foot section of the bridge collapsed in 1989 during the Loma Prieta earthquake, prompting efforts to make it quake tolerant.","NEW: Bridge ""is safer than when we closed it on Friday,"" official says .

1630,"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- A rocket fired by Palestinian militants fell on a Gaza home and killed two children, Palestinian sources said Friday, the same day Israel opened three Gaza border crossings for the first time in 10 days. A truck carrying grain enters Gaza from Israel on Friday at the Karni crossing point, one of three Israel reopened. A third child was in critical condition. The children, all girls, were cousins -- the two who died were 7 and 12, and the injured child is 5, Hamas security and Palestinian medical sources said. The rocket struck a house north of Gaza City. In a separate development, the Israeli military said it allowed a Palestinian who was badly wounded by rocket fire Wednesday to enter Israel for treatment. The Palestinian entered Israel through the Erez Crossing between northern Gaza and Israel. Israel closed the crossing for all but humanitarian reasons because of rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel by Palestinian militants. But it opened three other crossings Friday, allowing fuel and commodities into the Palestinian territory for the first time in more than a week. About 80 trucks filled with commodities were expected to cross into Gaza. Among the goods were 400,000 liters of fuel and 120 tons of cooking gas. The decision to open the crossings at Kerem Shalom, Karni and Nahal Oz came after requests from international aid groups and Egypt, said Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. In addition, he said, Israel has no desire to hurt the civilian population in Gaza. Lerner said whether to keep the crossings open would be a daily decision. United Nations assistance programs in Gaza have run out of flour and several essential pharmaceuticals, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. A tenuous six-month truce between the Hamas government in Gaza and Israel expired a week ago. Under the Egyptian-brokered deal, Hamas agreed to end militant attacks on Israel from Gaza, and Israel agreed to halt raids inside the territory and ease its blockade on humanitarian goods. In reality, the truce started breaking down two months ago. Rocket attacks by militants became more frequent, and Israel resumed airstrikes inside Gaza. Since then, dozens of rockets have been fired by Palestinian militants into Israel. Israel Defense Forces said about nine rockets have been launched from Gaza since midnight, pushing the three-day total to more than 110. There are no reports of casualties in Israel. The crossings opened a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met in Cairo and Egypt expressed concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Livni criticized Hamas after her meeting with Mubarak. ""Hamas needs to understand that Israel's basic desire to live in a tranquil region doesn't mean that Israel is willing to accept ongoing shooting at its population,"" she said, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. ""Enough is enough. We cannot accept this situation, and the situation will change."" Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has threatened to respond to the escalating violence. He warned Hamas again Thursday in an interview on the Al Arabiya television network and seemed to suggest that time was running out. ""We do not want to fight the Palestinian people, but we will not allow Hamas to strike our children,"" Olmert said. ""I did not come here to declare war,"" he continued. ""But Hamas must be stopped -- and so it will be. ""I will not hesitate to use Israel's strength to strike at Hamas and Islamic Jihad. How? I do not wish to go into details here.""","NEW: Militants' rocket hits Gaza house, killing Palestinian cousins .

1631,"(CNN) -- Mikey Welsh, most famously known as the bassist for the rock band Weezer, died unexpectedly Saturday, according to the band. He was 40. The cause of death was not immediately known. Darryl Baety, a Chicago police spokesman, said that officers responded at 1:45 p.m. Saturday to a call from the Raffaello Hotel regarding a guest who had been scheduled to check out, but had not. After first knocking on the door, hotel personnel entered and found someone who was ""unresponsive and not breathing,"" according to Baety. Police are conducting a death investigation related to the case, pending autopsy results, Baety said. According to Welsh's official website, he was a painter before he made the the shift to music at age 19. A decade later, he had achieved fame as the bassist for the band Weezer, replacing the band's longtime bassist Matt Sharp. Welsh was part of the band's 2001 ""Green Album"" release, which featured ""Hash Pipe."" The single became one of the band's biggest hits, peaking at No. 2 on Billboard's Alternative songs chart. Welsh left the band shortly after, saying he had suffered a nervous breakdown. The band remembered Welsh as vital chapter to their history and one to never ""shy away from the absurd, dangerous or strange,"" according to a statement on Weezer's website. Weezer played as scheduled Sunday during Chicago's RIOTfest. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Chicago police found an ""unresponsive"" man in a hotel, a spokesman says .

1632,"(CNN) -- Airline passengers left stranded by a freak snowstorm that pounded the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states were waiting to get to their destinations Sunday, many after spending a restless night on cots or airport floors. ""Whatever kind of system they had, it completely and utterly broke down,"" said passenger Fatimah Dahandari, who spent a night in Hartford, Connecticut's Bradley International Airport while trying to get to New York. ""It looks like a refugee camp in here."" More than 4 million people in at least five states were without power Sunday as the storm moved offshore. Up to five deaths, some in traffic accidents, were blamed on the storm. Dhandari said her Boston-to-New York flight diverted to Connecticut after being told there was a problem on a runway at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and the JetBlue plane did not have enough fuel to continue circling. ""We land in Connecticut and then it was one series of problems after another,"" she said. Her flight spent nine hours ""literally sitting on the runway"" with no food and water, she said. Passengers were told the plane was waiting to refuel, then was waiting for a gate, then had to get behind another plane that had an emergency on board, she said. By the time it was her plane's turn, the plane was snowed in and could not move, she said, so there was another wait to get a truck to tow it to the gate. Once she got into the airport, Dahandari said everything was closed, providing passengers with no food options. They were told that the hotels were booked, she said, and if they left the airport they could not come back in. She spent a night on the floor, and Sunday morning was standing in line with hundreds of others, hoping to receive a boarding pass and a spot on board a flight. Cell service inside the airport was spotty, she said, and ""everybody's phones are dying. People are trading chargers and laptops."" Overall, she said, passengers have been calm. ""I keep waiting for somebody to freak out, but nobody is."" She said people were being courteous to airline employees, despite their irritation, as ""they're kind of stuck here too."" The fashion consultant had hoped to attend two private Halloween parties in New York Saturday night that were important to her business, and planned to wear a $400 custom-made costume. ""Not only is this the worst traveling experience I've ever had, it's also the worst Halloween I've ever had,"" she said. JetBlue spokeswoman Victoria Lucia said in a statement Sunday that 17 flights were diverted on Saturday ""due to a confluence of events, including infrastructure issues in New York/JFK and Newark (New Jersey)."" Six of those flights were diverted to Hartford, the statement said. ""We worked with the airport to secure services, including remote deplaning and (lavatory) servicing,"" Lucia said. ""Obviously, we would have preferred deplaning much sooner than we did, but our flights were six of the 23 reported diversions into Hartford, including international flights."" In addition, Bradley Airport ""experienced intermittent power outages, which made refueling and jetbridge deplaning difficult,"" she said. ""We apologize to the customers impacted by this confluence of events, as it remains JetBlue's responsibility to not simply provide safe and secure travel, but a comfortable experience as well."" Passengers will receive a refund on their flight, as well as a voucher for the same amount as their round-trip fare, Lucia said later Sunday. The airline said on its web site that it was waiving change or cancel fees, along with fare differences, for travelers in a handful of airports -- Hartford; Newark, New Jersey; Newburgh, New York; New York from JFK or LaGuardia airports; and Westchester County, New York. Passenger Mara Dhaerman was also stranded in Hartford and said her JetBlue flight, initially from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Newark, New Jersey, spent nine hours on the tarmac in Connecticut. Passengers were told the plane was refueling, then de-icing, and that it was going to try to get back to Newark, but eventually a stairway was brought in and firefighters and troopers helped passengers deboard. She said she received a cot to sleep on about 1 a.m. Sunday. ""It's just very annoying,"" she said. CNN's Richard Roth was among those stranded in Hartford. ""It's been a tough night for everyone,"" he said Sunday. JetBlue planned to fly three flights to JFK Sunday and one to Newark, he said passengers were told, along with at least one to LaGuardia. The storm prompted the closure of Newark International Aiport. Also in New Jersey, Teterboro Airport closed Saturday afternoon but reopened hours later, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The FAA also reported major delays of up to 5 hours or more at New York's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports on Saturday. As of 10 a.m. Sunday, the FAA was reporting no delays. Other forms of travel were also impacted. An Amtrak train with 48 passengers on board was stuck for nearly 13 hours when a rock slide resulting from the snow storm blocked the tracks near Palmer, Massachusetts, said Amtrak spokeswoman Vernae Graham. The train, which originated in Chicago, was headed for Boston when it was forced to stop about 10 p.m. Saturday, she said. A bus was sent to pick up the passengers, but did not arrive until nearly 11 a.m. Sunday. The buses took so long because of the weather and road conditions, she said. The train cars never lost heat or electricity, Graham said, and passengers were given complimentary food and beverages. ""It's like a blizzard -- you can't see far at all,"" Alban Ajro of Watertown, Connecticut, said Saturday night. ""This is the first time that I can ever recall this kind of storm happening before Halloween."" The early onslaught meant heaps of wet snow fell on trees still heavy with leaves -- adding to the risk of falling branches and downed power lines. In Philadelphia, Interstate 95 was closed Sunday morning after black ice caused some 30 cars to crash, authorities told CNN afiliate KYW. Two people were killed, the station said. At least three deaths on Saturday were linked to the unusual October snowstorm. An 84-year-old man was napping on his recliner in Temple, Pennsylvania, on Saturday when a part of a large, snow-filled tree fell into his house and killed him, according to a state police report. With numerous downed trees in the area, rescue crews took two hours to safely remove the victim, police said. A motorist died in Hebron, Connecticut, state emergency spokesman Scott Devico said. A third person was killed in Springfield, Massachusetts, when a man in his 20s ignored police barricades surrounding downed power lines and touched a metal guard rail, which was charged, said city fire department spokesman Dennis Legere. Snow buried parts of New Jersey and New York on Saturday, including 15.5 inches in West Milford, New Jersey, and 12 inches in Harriman, New York. Cities in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland saw more than 9 inches of snow in less than one day. iReport: Winter weather near you . But the storm did little to deter Occupy Wall Street protesters, who camped out in tents coated with a layer of snow in New York's Zuccotti Park. A day earlier, dozens of firefighters removed the group's propane tanks and six generators, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, citing fire hazards. That left the demonstrators to battle the cold weather seeping through their tents, blankets and sleeping bags. ""Occupy"" demonstrators face bite of wintry storm . The governors of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts issued emergency declarations for their states. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Sunday that some 40 shelters are open, in addition to places where people can go to warm up, take a shower or charge their phones. ""We are expecting record lows tonight ... which means we're going to have some freezing conditions in the morning,"" he said. Malloy added that authorities have left it up to municipal officials whether or not to postpone Halloween celebrations because of the storm. Sunday evening, the state's largest utility -- Connecticut Light and Power -- reported nearly 788,000 customers were still without electricity. A total of about 807,500 households were in the dark in Connecticut. Elsewhere, about 1.9 million customers were without power Sunday in Pennsylvania; 639,000 in Massachusetts' 584,000 in New Jersey; and 299,000 in New York, according to figures from power companies in those states. Thousands also lost power in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia.

1634,"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- A second typhoon in a week pounded the Philippines over the weekend, weakening Sunday only after prompting evacuations, causing severe flooding and contributing to one death. Typhoon Nalgae, known locally as Quiel, had lost some strength by Sunday morning. But it still had maximum sustained winds of 130 kph (80 mph), with gusts recorded 30 kph stronger, according to a 4 a.m. Sunday advisory from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Administration. At that point, its center was 200 kilometers (124 miles) west of Baguio City. The storm follows Typhoon Nesat, which left at least 52 people dead and caused damage in 34 provinces since it hit Tuesday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council. The two typhoons will or have already affected about 3 million Filipinos, the nonprofit World Vision group estimated in a news release Saturday. The second typhoon -- Nalgae -- made landfall in Dinapigue, in Isabela province, on Saturday morning, the disaster council said. It is expected to have moved past the east Asian island nation by Sunday, forecasters said, after having brought rain of 15-25 millimeters per hour (0.6-1 inch) in many locales. Over the course of the weekend, the storm had made several roads impassable in the cities of Calasiao and Dagupan on Luzon island, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. Affected residents are being evacuated from those communities and others, including Santa Barbara. The disaster council, in a Sunday morning update, said that a 35-year-old man was killed and a 22-year-old woman injured in landslides triggered by the storm the previous day. At least 850 families, or roughly 3,500 people, in the provinces of La Union and Pangasinan have been directly affected by flooding, according to the council. Also Saturday, the San Roque Power Corporation opened two gates at one of its dams along the Agno River in north Luzon, due to high waters there related to the storm, the news agency said. Presidential spokesman Abigail Valte earlier Saturday urged residents of low-lying and mountainous areas that could be hit hard by the storm to evacuate, the state news agency said, citing an interview conducted on a government radio station. World Vision, the Christian humanitarian organization, said Saturday that it had to postpone some of its relief efforts due to Nalgae, with two of three emergency teams set to deploy once the storm passes. Another team is in Bulcan province, most of which is ""still submerged"" because of Nesat. The group is focusing its post-Nesat efforts on two communities in Manila and three in the northern Isabela and Zambales provinces. Vouchers are being distributed so people can buy needed items, some emergency supplies are being given out directly to citizens and 3,000 Manila children will receive school supplies. Sherbien Dacalanio, a CNN iReporter in the Philippines, described one area of Manila as being devastated by Nesat. ""The damage is shocking. It's like a damage brought by earthquake and tsunami,"" Dacalanio said.

1635,"(CNN) -- An earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Bali early Thursday, rattling buildings and sending dozens to hospitals with minor injuries. The 6.0-magnitude quake hit 100 km (62 miles) southwest of Bali, the U.S. Geological Survey said. At least 43 people were taken to local hospitals, including five who suffered serious injuries, medical officials said. A few suffered broken bones and are undergoing treatment, said Wayan Sudanti, an official at a local hospital. Another medical official at a nearby hospital said several others were undergoing treatment for minor injuries, but did not specify how many. The quake had a depth of 38 miles, and no tsunami alert was issued, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Indonesia is on the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In 2004, a 9.1-magnitude underwater earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people in 14 countries. The tsunami, which washed away entire communities, caused nearly $10 billion in damage and more casualties than any other tsunami in history, according to the United Nations.

1636,"Tokyo (CNN) -- A Japanese power company restarted a nuclear reactor this week, the first to come back online since a March earthquake and tsunami in the nation. The March 11 disasters sparked a nuclear crisis and a backlash that postponed plans to reopen reactors shut down because of damage, inspections or unrelated technical problems. Kyushu Electric Power Co. said it has started generating electricity from the No. 4 reactor late Tuesday at the Genkai nuclear power plant in western Japan. The reactor was taken offline in October after technical problems. Company officials won approval from a local governor and a mayor to bring the reactor online, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported. Nuclear safety critics criticized the reopening, with the power company receiving more than 200 calls Tuesday from citizens who opposed the move. Another power company said it may have suffered a setback in its efforts to handle damaged nuclear reactors. Tokyo Electric Power Co. said Wednesday it detected the chemical element xenon in a nuclear reactor at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a sign that nuclear fission may have occurred. The power company said it began injecting boric acid into the cooling system and has not seen a temperature change that would suggest nuclear fission has occurred. The reactor, No. 2, was one of several damaged in the wake of the historic March 11 disaster. Recently, Japanese officials said it may take 30 years to decommission the four damaged reactors at the power plant. A draft report, released by Japan's Atomic Energy Commission of the Cabinet Office last week, said the removal of debris -- or nuclear fuel -- should begin by the end of 2021.","The reactor went offline in October after technical problems .

1637,"New York (CNN) -- Nine Septembers have come and gone and yet, the many days that separate America now from a chilling day in its history did not dull remembrance Saturday. Once again, the nation paused in silence to mark the times when hijacked jets crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and nearly 3,000 lives were lost in a matter of minutes. But this year, a national debate over a proposed Islamic center near ground zero hovered over the day's heart-stopping sorrow, and the president once again pleaded for the tolerance that has come to define America. Rallies in favor of and against the center were held later in the day. At Manhattan's Zuccotti Park, adjacent to the September 11 memorial site, thousands gathered, wanting to be as close as they could to hallowed ground. As has become customary, the names of the 2,752 who perished at the World Trade Center were read out aloud -- each belonging to a mother or father, son or daughter, husband or wife, a friend, or even a stranger. ""We have returned to this sacred site to join our hearts together with the names of those we loved and lost,"" said New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg at the start of the ceremony. ""No other public tragedy has cut our city so deeply,"" he said. ""No other place is as filled with our compassion, our love, and our solidarity."" Silence befell New York at 8:46 a.m., the time when the first plane struck the North Tower. Another moment of quiet followed a few minutes later, at 9:03 a.m., when a second jet pierced through the South Tower. Shortly after the second moment of silence, Vice President Joe Biden read a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. ""Build today, then strong and sure with a firm and ample base; and ascending and secure shall tomorrow find its place. "" With each toll of the bell, an emotional chord struck hearts. Family members stepped forward to talk about those who were lost. And with each word, hot tears rolled down cheeks. A woman remembered her mother, Larissa Ceylon Taylor. ""Although I was 11 years old when you passed, you were my best friend and the greatest mom. We all love you and we miss you. God bless you, Mom. I love you."" Another spoke of her sister, Deborah Ann Dimartino. ""We will hold you close to our hearts."" And a brother, Christopher Epps, who was a Star Wars fan. ""Christopher, so handsome and, oh, so fine. With a heart of gold, why, oh why did you have to leave us behind? And I said to myself, I know why. God was looking for a captain of a ship, someone who qualifies as a jedi. So go on, dear brother, don't be shy. Your ship awaits you with 2,000 and more to stand by your side, to travel with you on your journey into the sky. May the force be with you, Christopher Epps. We love you and you are embedded in our hearts forever."" In his weekly address, President Barack Obama highlighted the scope of America's loss. ""We think about the milestones that have passed over the course of nine years -- births and christenings, weddings and graduations -- all with an empty chair,"" he said. ""On this day, we also honor those who died so that others might live: the firefighters and first responders who climbed the stairs of two burning towers; the passengers who stormed a cockpit; and the men and women who have, in the years since, borne the uniform of this country and given their lives so that our children could grow up in a safer world,"" Obama said. Later, Obama laid a wreath at the Pentagon, where American Airlines Flight 77 struck and killed 184 people, and sounded again a message of tolerance, keenly aware that this anniversary was cast under a different light. Beyond the outpouring of grief on this day lay rising anti-Muslim sentiment and furious controversy over a proposed Islamic center two blocks away from where the World Trade Center once soared. It's an issue that has even split the families and survivors of the 2001 attacks. New York police beefed up security as Americans voiced their opinions Saturday afternoon at rallies over the site. Speakers in favor of the location reminded the nation that Muslims, too, were among the victims of the September 11 attacks and that anti-Islamic sentiment in America is the result of misguided wrath. ""Unity yes, racism no,"" the demonstrators chanted. Shortly afterward, opponents held their own gathering, chanting ""No Mosque"" and ""USA"" as speakers decried the plans and said the nation shouldn't forget the terrorist attack on September 11. Attorney General Eric Holder vowed the Justice Department would continue ""working tirelessly to combat terrorism in all its forms and to hold accountable all those responsible for the September 11 attacks in a manner that is consistent with our nation's values."" Holder spoke Saturday at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington. He paid tribute to the 72 law enforcement officers killed that day. ""This work goes on, and it will always remain my highest priority,"" Holder said. ""Let us take their dream of a world that is better, safer and more just and make it our own."" Obama reiterated that America is not at war with Islam but with al Qaeda's ""sorry band of men which perverts religion."" ""They may wish to drive us apart but we will not give in to their hatred and prejudice,"" he said. ""The perpetrators of this evil act didn't simply attack America, they attacked the very idea of America itself. ""And so the highest honor we can pay those we lost, indeed our greatest weapon in this ongoing war, is to do what our adversaries fear the most -- to stay true to who we are as Americans, to renew our sense of common purpose, to say that we define the character of our country and we will not let the acts of some small band of murderers who slaughter the innocent and cower in caves distort who we are,"" he said. Fueling further controversy, a Florida pastor had threatened to burn a Quran on this fateful day. But just before the ceremonies began, the Rev. Terry Jones said he was canceling the Quran burning planned for 6 p.m. ""We will definitely not burn the Quran,"" Rev. Terry Jones told NBC's ""Today"" on Saturday. ""Not today, not ever."" In Shanksville, first lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Laura Bush led the commemoration for the victims of Flight 93, which crashed and burned as passengers and crew fought hijackers determined to strike the U.S. Capitol. ""I come here as an American, filled with a sense of awe at the heroism of my fellow citizens,"" Michelle Obama said. ""I come as a wife, a daughter, and a sister, heartbroken at the loss so many of you have endured."" Laura Bush said the hijackers of United Flight 93 had other targets in mind, but the crash spot near Shanksville ""was chosen by the passengers, who spared our country from even greater horrors."" Before his wife's comments, George W. Bush issued a statement recalling the day that came to shape his presidency. ""On September 11, 2001, Americans awoke to evil on our shores,"" he said. ""We recall the many acts of heroism on that day, and we honor those who work tirelessly to prevent another attack."" In New York, the ninth September 11 anniversary was also different in another way: for the first time people gathered amid signs of rebirth rising from the ashes. Next year, on this day, a new memorial is expected to open and on Saturday, the families of those who died were able to see some tangible progress of the structures that are being erected to honor their loved ones. The planned memorial includes six skyscrapers, a museum, two waterfalls in the footprints of the twin towers, a performance center and a rail terminal. The first 16 oak trees of more than 400 that will line the memorial have already been planted. They will surround the acre-size waterfalls around which will be the names of the dead, etched in bronze. Earlier this week, workers installed two 50-ton steel columns that once ringed the north tower at what will be the entrance to the memorial and museum. And there is a reflecting pool, around which police, firefighters and dignitaries gathered, and later throngs of people stopped to toss a solitary long-stemmed rose. By the time the ceremonies came to a close Saturday, it had turned into to a plush blanket of bloom. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Naima Pettigrew contributed to this report.","NEW: War on terrorism will continue, attorney general says .

1638,"QUANTICO, Virginia (CNN) -- Motorcycle accidents have killed more Marines in the past 12 months than enemy fire in Iraq, a rate that's so alarming, it has prompted top brass to call a meeting to address the issue, officials say. Despite crashes, Gunnery Sgt. Art Tucker rides a sport motorcycle. ""I enjoy it. ... It relaxes me,"" he says. Twenty-five Marines have died in motorcycle crashes since November -- all but one of them involving sport bikes that can reach speeds of well over 100 mph, according to Marine officials. In that same period, 20 Marines have been killed in action in Iraq. The 25 deaths are the highest motorcycle death toll ever for the Marine Corps. Gen. James Amos, the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, told CNN that commanders are trying to drill down on what ""we need to do to help our Marines survive on these sport bikes."" ""The Marines are very serious about it,"" he said.  Watch these aren't your father's Harleys » . Marine Gunnery Sgt. Art Tucker knows all too well about the dangers of sport bikes. An owner of a Kawasaki Ninja, Tucker has had two crashes, and the second one nearly killed him. ""I sustained a broken collar bone; I tore the shoulder out of the socket; I tore three ligaments in the shoulder, the rotator cuff; I broke three vertebrae,"" said Tucker, a drill instructor for new officers. ""The worst was a head injury I received: a bruised brain. And it caused hemorrhaging, and from that I had partial paralysis of the left leg, full paralysis of the left foot and toes, and that was for approximately six months."" Amos said he and other top Marine officials will spend half the day Monday ""focusing on nothing but motorcycle issues."" The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, and other senior leadership will attend the meeting at the Quantico, Virginia, Marine base, he said. About 18,000 of the nearly 200,000 Marines are believed to own motorcycles, Amos said. The Marines have taken some measures. The Marine Corps has had a long-standing policy for all Marines who ride motorcycles to take a mandatory basic riding course. More recently, it added a second training course specifically designed to train Marines who ride sport bikes. Any Marine caught riding, even on leave, without going through the training courses faces Marine Corps punishment, officials say. On a recent day at the Quantico training track, Marines whizzed by on their bikes. ""I think the basic rider course has been great,"" said Cpl. Austin Oakley. ""Here, they put you in situations you want to be wary of out in that open road."" Oakley said he recently returned to the United States from Japan, and he immediately jumped at the chance to buy a sport bike. He said it's not uncommon for Marines to have motorcycle clubs within their units. ""We'll go out on rides together. Fridays for lunchtime, we'll all meet up and go to lunch,"" Oakley said. ""When I get on my motorcycle, it's me and the motorcycle. I don't need to go fast. I don't need to do anything like that. It's just being free."" The rise in motorcycle deaths isn't confined to Marines. The Navy says it's had 33 deaths on motorcycles over the past 12 months, a 65 percent jump from the previous time period. And authorities say motorcycle deaths have been a problem in the civilian world, too. Military officials say they're not sure why the deaths are on the rise. They initially believed that the accidents might involve mostly young Marines and sailors about 18 or 19 years old. But Navy statistics show that five of the victims were 25, the most prevalent of any age involved in the crashes. And two 40-year-old sailors were killed in motorcycle crashes. Amos said the Marines have seen a similar trend. But he says the new training seems to be working: Of the 300 young men and women who have gone through the sport-bike course, only three have had accidents. The safety course instructors said some Marines who go through the training decide the sport bike is not for them. But even some Marines who've survived past crashes still want to ride again, even after they get the new training. ""I enjoy it,"" said Tucker. ""I can actually get on my motorcycle and ride, and it's just like if I were to do bowling or rock climbing or scuba diving. It's something for me. It relaxes me.""","25 Marines killed on motorcycles in past 12 months, compared with 20 killed in Iraq .

1639,"(CNN) -- Four days of heavy rains triggered a landslide that killed 12 children and eight adults near Mount Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania, authorities said Friday. Five of the children were under six, said Suzan Kaganda, a police department spokeswoman. The death toll could go up as rescue crews search the area for people reported missing, Kaganda said. Most victims of the late Tuesday landslide live in the Kilimanjaro region near the mountain by the same name, Kaganda said. The mountain is the highest peak in Africa and is a major tourist attraction. U.N. officials warned last month that east Africa is facing mudslides, crop destruction and waterborne diseases as a result of heavy downpour triggered by El Nino weather patterns. Most east African countries have been water-starved in the past few years, exacerbating the results of floods, because a lot of greenery disappeared in the drought.","Most victims of the landslide live in the Kilimanjaro region near the mountain by the same name .

1641,"BILOXI, Mississippi (CNN)  -- It's been almost three years since Hurricane Katrina cut a merciless path of destruction across the U.S. Gulf Coast, killing more than 1,800 people and displacing tens of thousands more. Cameron Sinclair on site in Biloxi, Mississippi -- one of many rebuilding projects that Architecture for Humanity is overseeing. The coastal resort of Biloxi was among the hardest hit; hurricane-force winds leveled homes, stripped branches from trees and created a trail of devastation that rendered the popular Casino town virtually uninhabitable. Three years on, homes are still being rebuilt to house people who were forced to seek shelter wherever they could. For some, that's meant spending years living in cramped conditions in caravans until they could afford to rebuild. Cameron Sinclair, Co-founder of Architecture for Humanity, is leading a project to rehouse residents of Biloxi affected by the storm. On July 9, he'll be taking part in a Principal Voices debate on Design for Good: How can clever design conserve precious resources and lead to a greener way of life? CNN caught up with Cameron Sinclair in Biloxi and started by asking him what the difference is between design and design for good? Cameron Sinclair: Design is about creating spaces for people to enjoy and of course, creating moments where you elevate the spirit, but design for good is figuring out a program that not only creates better spaces, but creates jobs, creates new industry and really kind of raises the conversation about how we rebuild. CNN: How many countries are you working in and what are you doing? CS: We are currently in about 26 countries and we have around about 4000 volunteer architects and designers globally. We are working on a whole range of projects whether it be bringing health services into remote Nepal or working on a chocolate factory in the Amazon which is actually a conservation project, or doing low income housing in Cape town, South Africa, so we're pretty global in our reach. CNN: You have worked all over the world, Iran, Africa, and Asia. When you think of people's living conditions, are you surprised that Americans don't realize how tough people have it in their own country? Have you seen things in the U.S., for example, that are worse than in so-called developing countries? CS: Yeah, I mean people find it kind of shocking when I talk about this. You know, there are places in rural America, especially in places like the reservations, we've done a lot of work with Hopi and Navajo and we're about to start work with the Iroquois where I look at the housing stock and it is far worse then I've seen in somewhere like South Africa or you know, in Ghana. You know, Americans are unbelievably open, welcoming and helpful, they donate to everybody. But quite often we don't look at the reality of our own lives. The fact that we have a crumbling school system, that our healthcare in this country is just diabolical, the support for nurses and teachers is just out of control and I look at all these facilities that are happening in the U.S. and I begin to question. This is supposed to be the most powerful place in the world but we can't build a decent school for our kids so you know there is a reality check that needs to happen. CNN: When you look at the big picture of the problems the world is facing, what solutions can you see that cities and their designs can offer when it comes to global issues such as global warming? CS: What worries me the most is you have all these global issues that are out there, whether its lack of education or lack of healthcare or climate change, and people think they are separate compartmentalized issues, but they're all interweaved so that when we're working on structures, we're thinking about how can we make the building energy efficient. How can we make the design open, allowing access to everybody so that you're hitting on all these things. We're working in neighborhoods where sustainability is a matter of life or death for people so climate change is an issue for us, but we may not be putting solar panels on the side of the building we just may be looking at creating a way of getting clean water into the village and that mechanism is important. CNN: How vital is sustainability? CS: It's very vital. I mean, we've never pushed ourselves as a green organization. We've never done that kind of branding, you know, of great green buildings but all our architects and all our designers in the field realize that they have to have an element of sustainability because communities can't maintain things they can't afford and if its not sustainable both materialistic and also financially then the building will be underutilized so it's a waste of everybody's time. If you build something that is out of the reach of the community, then they can't own it. There's no empowerment in taking over that structure. CNN: How do you see your role in all of this? CS: The main thing is, I'm not the architect on this. We have architecture firms in a 100 countries right now, who are working on projects and as a way, we're working as a bridge, so architecture humanity bridges that kind of leg between the community, the design and the funding, so we have to bring in all the funding. We have to make sure that we have the legal and financial constraints in place and understood that the designers are committed to the process so in a way we're acting as that mediator between all those different stake holders. CNN: I'm curious how on a personal level it has impacted your life, I mean you came out of college or university and basically went straight into this. It is your life in a way. CS: Yeah, no. I mean, this really has become my life and a lot of other people that work with me, it's their life but we haven't become financially rich but we've become rich in many other ways. Just in the last month some of the communities that we have sat down and had dinner with and talked about their lives and the things their hopeful about is incredibly inspiring. It's what keeps us going. CNN: So it's not a job, is it? CS: No, I don't think anyone could live if they just had a job. A career is a job you love, right? That's what a career should be. If you're in a job that you hate, you should quit. That's the way I look at it. I'm in a job that I love so I'm going to make it my career. Do you have a question for our panelists?

1642,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- New Orleans police lined up ""like at a firing range"" and fatally shot an unarmed man in the back as he fled from them in the days after Hurricane Katrina swept ashore, a witness to the shooting told CNN. It marks the first time a witness has come forward publicly with information about the shooting of Ronald Madison, a 40-year-old mentally retarded man whose death has sparked a police investigation and a grand jury probe into what happened in and around the Danziger Bridge that day. ""He just fell like he was collapsing,"" Kasimir Gaston told CNN. ""Like something just wiped him out."" Gaston was one of many flood refugees living on the second floor of the Friendly Inn, a low-income motel on the city's east side. On Sunday, September 4, 2005, he says he woke up and stepped onto the balcony of the motel and saw a man running, hands outstretched and being fired upon. Former officer pleads guilty in shooting . Initial police accounts said that Madison reached for his waistband and turned on police, but Gaston said Madison did not appear to have a weapon and that he was running away from police ""hands out, full speed"" when he was shot. Police declined CNN's request for an interview. After the shooting last year, police said officers had responded to reported gunshots on the Danziger Bridge and that a running gunbattle ensued with six suspects. One teenager was killed near the base of the bridge and three other people were wounded, according to police reports. A police department press release from October 4, 2005, said Madison, described as an unidentified gunman, was ""confronted by a New Orleans Police officer. The suspect reached into his waist and turned toward the officer who fired one shot, fatally wounding him."" When asked if Madison had a gun, Gaston said, ""I didn't see any on him."" No gun was found on Madison's body. An autopsy obtained previously by CNN and verified by the Orleans Parish Coroner said Madison suffered five gunshot wounds to his back and two in his shoulder. Gaston said he came forward now because he is still troubled by what happened. He said he decided to break his silence after watching a ""CNN Presents"" documentary, ""Shoot to Kill,"" about the days after Katrina hit the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005. CNN has visited the room where Gaston was staying. From that balcony, it is about 100 feet to where Madison was shot and killed. The police department has said the shooting has been thoroughly investigated. But Gaston said no officer or detective approached him about what he saw. He was not asked for his name or phone number, Gaston said. Gaston said his only contact with police on that day was when officers told him not to touch Madison's body, which was lying behind Gaston's truck, parked in the motel entranceway. CNN has obtained a newspaper photo taken that Sunday morning that shows where the body fell. The back of a truck with a rusted trailer hitch and broken tail light can be seen in the photo. The photo appears to be Gaston's truck, which now sits in a parking lot in Dallas, Texas, where he now lives. ""They notified me that I had two bullet holes in the passenger side,"" he said. Two bullet marks can be seen at the right rear of the truck today. Mary Howell, an attorney suing New Orleans police on behalf of the dead man's family, says there were several potential witnesses living at the Friendly Inn at the time of the shooting. She has accused police of violating procedures by failing to even write down their names. Howell said Ronald Madison and his older brother, Lance Madison, were trying to avoid the shootout between police and others that day when they ran up the Danziger Bridge, toward the other side of the Industrial Canal. Lance Madison has said a policeman pointed what looked like a rifle or shotgun at his brother and shot Ronald near the top of the bridge. Lance said he helped carry his wounded brother to the entrance of the motel and left him there while he ran for help. After being arrested, Lance was brought back to the motel where, he says, he first saw his brother was dead. Howell said police, in the chaos after Hurricane Katrina, failed to properly investigate the fatal shooting and are now trying to put everything behind them. ""There's a lot of things that have been washed away with this hurricane,"" Howell said. ""We are doing everything we can to make sure this is not one of them."" While the family of Ronald Madison presses on with its lawsuit, a grand jury in New Orleans is investigating the case. Gaston said he is willing to testify before the grand jury if it will help get to the truth. ""I'm not trying to say nobody did this and nobody did that,"" Gaston said. ""I'm just saying what I saw and being truthful and honest about what I saw with my own eyes.""","Ronald Madison, a 40-year-old mentally retarded man, was shot on September 4, 2005 .

1643,"(CNN)  -- Emergency teams on Sunday were assessing damage from deadly storms that devastated parts of Missouri, Kentucky and West Virginia this weekend -- even as the threat of more severe weather continued. West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin tours Mingo County to assess damage caused by extensive rain and flooding. The storm that tore through Madison County, Kentucky, on Friday was a category EF-3 tornado, the National Weather Service said Sunday. An EF-3 is the third-strongest category of tornado, with winds of 136 to 165 mph, strong enough to destroy large buildings and lift cars off the ground. At least one person was killed by that storm, with several other serious injuries. A waste water treatment plant was destroyed, two fire departments sustained major roof damage and some manufacturing facilities were damaged, local authorities said. Three people were killed in southern Missouri during high winds, thunderstorms and flash floods. A couple was killed when a tree fell on their car on a highway near Poplar Bluff. A man died of a heart attack near Springfield when winds tossed him and his wife into an open field, officials said. A weekend of storming in West Virginia destroyed as many as 400 buildings and severely damaged an additional 1,000, said Rob Jelacic of the West Virginia Office of Emergency Services. ""We are in recovery mode,"" Jelacic said Sunday. There were no known deaths in West Virginia from the storms. After the storms came floods. On Sunday, parts of the Meramec and Big rivers were rising feet above flood levels, causing residents already hit by the storms to seek higher ground. Forecasters expected the Meramec to crest Monday 4 to 8 feet above flood state in St. Louis County. The big river was expected to crest a half-foot higher on Monday than it did Sunday.","Tornado hits Kentucky with 136 to 165 mph winds, kills one .

1645,"(CNN) -- Somalia's president on Wednesday declared three days of national mourning for the victims of a suicide truck bomb that killed more than 70 people in Mogadishu, the nation's capital. According to the Health Ministry, 72 were killed Tuesday and 103 remained injured, 38 of those in serious condition. A majority of the victims were students and their parents who were registering for an education program at a government complex. Al-Shabaab, an Islamist movement that has links to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility. President Sharif Ahmed visited the scene and some of the hospitals where the victims were, the government said in a statement. Some of the injured who cannot be treated in Somalia will be flown to other countries. ""At this time, when the country is in the midst of a worsening humanitarian crisis, the terrorists could not have attacked the Somali people at a worse time,"" said Abdulkadir Hussein Mohamed, the country's minister of information. According to the government, Tuesday's bombing was the second Al-Shabaab attack in two years that specifically targeted students. In December 2009, a suicide bomber attacked a university graduation ceremony in Mogadishu, killing more than 20 people. Al-Shabaab is a group in Somalia that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States government in March 2008. It is waging a war against Somalia's government to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. Federal and African Union forces in the impoverished and chaotic nation have battled the group for years. Many analysts believe that Al-Shabaab has been severely weakened by the African Union Mission in Somalia, targeted strikes against foreign members and the weakening of al Qaeda.","A suicide truck bomb killed more than 70 people Tuesday .

1647,"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's floodwaters inched toward downtown Bangkok Saturday, threatening some subway stations as leaders urged residents not to open defenses set up to divert the waters from the capital. At least six subway stations are on the floodway, authorities said. Residents have threatened to open the defenses to drain water from their flooded neighborhoods, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said. ""The main problem of solving flood is no longer technical but people,"" Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said during the weekly radio address. The flooding has killed 442 people, the Interior Ministry said. Of Thailand's 64 provinces, 25 have been affected. Bangkok's central business district is still dry but other parts of the bustling metropolis of 12 million people are inundated. The flooding has had an enormous business impact as many factories and offices have been under water for more than a month. Affected businesses include Hi Tech Industrial Park, where Canon and Sony own assembly plants. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Interior Ministry: Flooding has killed 442 people .

1648,"(CNN) -- Cholera has already killed almost 3,000 Haitians. Now it is threatening to cause misery in another vital way. A chunk of Haiti's rice harvest will probably be lost because of farmers' fears of cholera contamination, the United Nations said Wednesday. On top of that, consumers are afraid to buy rice grown in areas affected by the cholera outbreak. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the Haitian Ministries of Agriculture and Health are providing hygiene information to farmers who are reluctant to step into rice paddies, fed by rivers and canals, to harvest the crops. The U.N. food agency, concerned that lost crops may lead to food shortages, urged more outreach and hands-on training in rural communities. The effects of the cholera outbreak were magnified by floods in November caused by Hurricane Tomas. ""Without a timely response to the damage caused by floods and cholera to Haitian agriculture, food security could plunge, worsening the effects of last January's earthquake on the poor rural population,"" the FAO said in a statement. Cholera has sickened more than 130,000 people in Haiti and 2,761 have died. But those numbers from the Haitian health ministry are from December 18. Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF or Doctors Without Borders), which has been operating cholera treatment centers throughout Haiti, warned that the disease is still spreading. Symptoms of the acute, bacterial illness, which is caused by drinking tainted water, can be mild or even nonexistent. But sometimes they can be severe: leg cramps, profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration, shock and death. Some aid groups, including MSF, have criticized the cholera response in Haiti as woefully inadequate, given the fact that about 12,000 aid groups operate within the country. ""I recently went to Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and found my Medicins Sans Frontieres colleagues overwhelmed, having already treated more than 75,000 cholera cases,"" MSF International President Unni Karunakara wrote in a commentary published this week in a British newspaper, the Guardian. ""In the 11 months since the quake, little has been done to improve sanitation across the country, allowing cholera to spread at a dizzying pace.""","Farmers are afraid to harvest in paddies they believe are contaminated .

1649,"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- At least two car bombs exploded Friday near the television studios of Televisa in Ciudad Victoria, the capital of Tamaulipas state in northeastern Mexico, authorities said. One blast occurred outside the TV station while the second happened next to the municipal transit service offices, said the state attorney general's office. No fatalities or injuries were reported. The nearly simultaneous blasts occurred shortly after midnight. The explosion in front of Televisa, a CNN affiliate, damaged the building and knocked out power on the block, the station said. The station also was knocked off the air locally, Televisa said. Images of one of the blasts show the carcass of a car, the explosion leaving only the vehicle's mangled frame but not causing much damage to nearby buildings or trees. The wreckage lies next to a wooden street pole that is slightly tilted and holds a stop sign. The car that exploded in front of the television studio was a red Chevrolet Corsica with Texas license plates, the attorney general's office said in a news release. The car in front of the transit office was a white Mazda, also with Texas license plates, officials said. Tamaulipas is the state where authorities discovered 72 bodies this week on a ranch believed to be used by narcotraffickers. Authorities are investigating whether the 58 men and 14 women, who were migrants from Central and South America, were killed by the Zetas cartel. Televisa previously came under attack August 15 when a grenade damaged apartments near the TV station's office in the city of Monterrey in neighboring Nuevo Leon state. There were no reports of injuries in that attack. A similar attack occurred the previous day, when a grenade was launched against the Televisa offices in the city of Matamoros, in Tamaulipas. The building was damaged but there were no reports of injuries. It was not clear Friday why Televisa is being targeted. Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon have become a bloody battleground between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, which ended an alliance earlier this year. The Zetas used to be the armed branch of the Gulf Cartel but have split off into a separate drug-trafficking organization. Journalists have come under increasing attack in Mexico, as drug cartels try to limit the information being distributed about their activities. The Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent, nonprofit organization, criticized this month's grenade attacks against Televisa. ""No journalist is safe in Mexico when criminal groups feel free to wage grenade attacks on a national broadcaster,"" said Carlos Lauria, the organization's senior program coordinator for the Americas. ""Drug traffickers are increasingly terrorizing the press and defining what is news and what isn't. We urge the Mexican authorities must fully investigate these incidents and bring those responsible to justice."" Eight journalists were killed in Mexico in 2009 and another eight have been killed so far this year, the Committee to Protect Journalists said this month. In total, 54 journalists and media workers have been slain in Mexico since 1992, the group said. Car bombings by Mexican cartels are a new phenomena. Among the first was a July 15 explosion in Ciudad Juarez that killed four people.","One car bomb targeted Televisa, a CNN affiliate .

1650,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station returned to the plant Friday after a strong aftershock forced them to leave a day earlier, the plant's owner said. The quake forced crews at the plant to evacuate as it rattled northern Japan late Thursday night. They returned to the plant about eight and a half hours later, and no fresh damage to the facility had been reported Friday afternoon, the Tokyo Electric Power Company said. Before the quake, engineers had been injecting non-flammable nitrogen into the No. 1 reactor containment shell to counter a buildup of hydrogen in the chamber. That process continued while the plant was evacuated, and so did the pumping of fresh water into that reactor and units 2 and 3, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. Hydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheated fuel rods in the cores of the reactors, which plant workers have been struggling to keep under control since the earthquake and tsunami. The nitrogen injections are aimed at displacing oxygen in the reactor shell, reducing the possibility of an explosion -- a chance Tokyo Electric called ""extremely low."" A hydrogen explosion blew the roof and upper walls off the No 1. reactor building two days after the quake, and another blast two days later blew apart the No. 3 building. A suspected hydrogen explosion is believed to have damaged the No. 2 reactor on March 15 as well. Both the Japan Meteorological Agency and the U.S. Geological Survey have rated Thursday's quake a magnitude 7.1, though the Japanese initially rated it at 7.4. It was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of the plant, near the epicenter of the magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami that knocked out the plant's coolant systems four weeks ago Friday. It also caused radioactive water to spill from the spent fuel cooling pools of another nuclear power plant, Tohoku Electric's Onagawa plant, the Sendai-based utility and NISA reported Friday. About 15 liters (3.9 gallons) of water spilled, and the concentration of radioactive particles was far below levels that would pose an immediate threat to human health, the company said. The three reactors at the Onagawa plant, about 140 kilometers (88 miles) north of Fukushima Daiichi, shut down automatically when the March 11 earthquake struck and have not been restarted. Workers at Fukushima Daiichi have been struggling to keep the reactors from overheating for four weeks, pouring tons of fresh water an hour into the reactors and trying to contain the spread of radioactive contamination that has been pouring out. About 78,000 people who live within a 20-kilometer radius of the plant were ordered to leave their homes in the days following the quake, and another 62,000 within 20 to 30 kilometers have been told to remain indoors. But government readings show that people beyond the current restricted zone may be exposed to dangerous long-term doses of radiation even though the readings fall below levels that now require an evacuation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Thursday. Edano, the Japanese government's point man on the crisis, said the country may set standards for long-term radiation exposure that would effectively extend the evacuation zone around the damaged plant. ""It is time for the government to consider setting another category for accumulated exposure,"" Edano told reporters. ""The safety of the people is the first priority, and social needs come after that."" There is no timetable for a decision, Edano said. Readings released Thursday by the country's science ministry from areas outside that zone indicated that long-term exposure could top the government's one-time standards for an evacuation within a few months. Some of those are in towns to the northwest, where prevailing winds have blown radioactive particles released from the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The recorded doses are far below those that would cause radiation sickness but could pose a long-term risk of cancer, according to medical experts. The anti-nuclear group Greenpeace and the International Atomic Energy Agency raised alarms about the spread of radioactivity beyond the 30-kilometer zone in late March.

1651,"(CNN) -- Events at a West Virginia air show were canceled for a second day Sunday after a crash a day earlier that killed a stunt pilot, show organizers said. No one on the ground was injured in the crash Saturday. Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board arrived in Martinsburg on Sunday to begin piecing together what went wrong. The crash occurred about five minutes into a planned 15-minute flight, said NTSB investigator Tim Monville. Some victims of Nevada air race crash identified . ""During one of the planned aerobatic maneuvers ... two opposing airplanes were to pass each other laterally,"" then pull up and perform a roll, Monville said. The plane that crashed ""did not complete the maneuver."" Monville declined to identify the pilot. CNN iReporter Jennifer Clark took pictures of the 2:30 p.m. ET crash, showing flames and black plumes of smoke rising from the ground. ""We saw a flash of light ... and heard the explosion sound,"" she told CNN's Don Lemon on Saturday. ""It was scary."" ""You just heard the whole crowd gasp simultaneously and everybody just kind of went silent and was just watching what was going on,"" she said. Event organizers on Sunday urged those who witnessed the crash ""to seek out support if they feel that viewing the accident traumatically affected them."" The West Virginia crash came one day after another deadly air crash. A pilot lost control of his vintage plane during an air race in Reno, Nevada, on Friday, plummeting toward thousands of spectators before narrowly missing a grandstand and slamming into box seats. Nine people, including the pilot, died in that accident, according to local police.","A pilot was killed in a crash Saturday .

1652,"San Francisco (CNN) -- iSad. That was the reaction of many as millions took to the web with the news of the death of 56-year-old Steve Jobs. Facebook and Twitter messages were filled with links and anecdotes about the impact technology -- and more specifically, Apple -- had on users' lives. Apple invited people to email their thoughts, memories and condolences after announcing Jobs' death Wednesday, saying the company lost a ""visionary and creative genius and the world has lost an amazing human being."" CNN's iReport is also collecting reactions. Jobs' death jolted a generation that has never known a world without a cellular phone, and it elicited reactions from those who watched Apple grow from a Silicon Valley garage startup in 1976 to today's leading tech company. ""RIP, Steve Jobs,"" read many Facebook messages. Still others invoked the visionary's signature stage pitch, ""And one more thing ... Thank you."" Many tweeted simply: iSad or iHeaven. ""Oh my God, dad. Steve Jobs has died. He's my generation's Walt Disney,"" 20-year-old Lauren Harrington of Atlanta told her father upon learning Wednesday night that Jobs had died. Celebrities, corporate executives and politicians, including President Barack Obama, paid tribute to Jobs. ""Our parents had JFK, we had Steve Jobs. Edison gave us electricity, Jobs gave us the Jetsons in real life,"" tweeted director and actor Kevin Smith. ""We lost an icon today. Mourn him."" Actor Ashton Kutcher tweeted: ""Sending love & light to everyone @Apple & the entire Jobs family. Today we lost a Giant who will be missed even by those who didn't know him. I never thought I could be so busted up about the loss of someone I never met."" Obama hailed Jobs as one of America's greatest innovators, a man ""brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it."" ""The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented,"" Obama said in a statement released Wednesday. Obama, an avowed BlackBerry fan, revealed this week to ABC's George Stephanopoulos that Jobs personally gave him an advanced copy of the iPad 2. House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) tweeted: ""There is not a day that goes by, and often not an hour, that a Steve Jobs' invention does not better my family's life. Thank you Steve."" The flood of messages slowed Twitter to a crawl at times or produced error messages saying the site was over capacity. On the social networking sites, many quoted from Jobs' heartfelt commencement address at Stanford University in 2005, where he first detailed his battle with pancreatic cancer. Actor Hill Harper, paraphrasing the speech, tweeted: ""Do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do! ... Don't settle."" Apple flew the flags at its Cupertino, California, office at half-staff, and an impromptu memorial sprang up at the venue as people arrived with flowers, letters and mementos, CNN affiliates reported. Several employees tweeted messages containing only the Apple logo. The many websites devoted to Apple rumors and products placed large banners in memory of the company's co-founder. The alternative-culture blog Boing Boing revamped its design in honor of Jobs to resemble retro Macintosh software. Wired painted its front page black, with a shadowed picture of Steve Jobs in the center. Google's co-founders posted statements about Jobs' importance to them personally and to the industry, and underneath the search box on Google.com, the company added: ""Steve Jobs, 1955 - 2011."" Research in Motion, from its BlackBerry Twitter account, called Jobs ""a great visionary and respected competitor."" Microsoft's Bill Gates, who once worked with Jobs and later competed against him in the mobile world, said on his Twitter account: ""For those of us lucky enough to get to work with Steve, it's been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely,"" â€” Bill Gates. And two men, whose social networking sites gained in popularity thanks in part to Jobs' mobile-computing revolution, paid their respects to Apple's mogul. In a message, Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg said: ""Steve, thank you for a being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you."" Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey wrote simply: ""Thank you."" CNN's Mark Milian, Douglas Hyde, Ed Payne, Chelsea J. Carter and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","Facebook and Twitter users post ""RIP, Steve Jobs""

1653,"(CNN) -- As filthy floodwater continued to seep towards central Bangkok, Thailand's Prime Minister laid out a three-point plan to get the country back on its feet after the worst flooding in 50 years. Immediate aid will be issued to people whose homes and businesses have been destroyed by the deluge which has claimed more than 500 lives since July, Yingluck Shinawatra announced Tuesday. ""This disaster is the biggest that we have ever met. We're trying to cope with situation and help as much as we can,"" she said. ""We can't stop all flooding but we will try to reduce the impact."" Aid packages will be offered to people to help restore homes and businesses as part of a short-term recovery plan over the coming year. Details are expected to be announced next week. Longer-term plans include the formation of two committees, one to oversee reconstruction and future development and the other to manage water resources. Yingluck acknowledged criticism of the official response to the disaster by setting herself a deadline of one year to win back public confidence. The prime minister's promises came as murky waters continued to move towards Bangkok's city center. ""The situation is quite serious. The water is making ground slowly but surely towards the heart of Bangkok,"" flood relief co-ordinator Rungsun Munkong told CNN. He said thousands of people were refusing to leave their homes despite orders to evacuate to outer provinces. ""I believe thousands of people are in their homes and are still not evacuating,"" Rungsun said. ""(They) possibly will be stranded with little food and water as time goes by."" Relief workers, distributing aid to evacuation centers in central Bangkok, said they were struggling to reach residents determined to wait out the crisis in tower blocks. ""I think it will be difficult down the road to get help to these people,"" Rungsun said. ""People need clean water, that's the first important thing. Cooked ready-to-eat food is also quite important, baby milk and so on."" Thailand has been inundated with its worst flood in half a century, affecting at least 25 of the country's 77 provinces. More than 500 people had been killed in the deluge according to figures released Sunday by the country's interior ministry. A Thailand Disaster and Mitigation Department report, issued Sunday and reported by MCOT, estimated about 3.1 million people have been affected and 4 million acres of farmland have been damaged. Moreover, the department said two people are believed missing and about 75 highways have closed. In the provinces of Nakhon Sawan and Ayutthaya, cleanup efforts were under way. On Sunday, the Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra visited Nonthaburi, near Bangkok. There, the government provided 100 boats to help transport people and disperse relief supplies after requests by local officials, according to MCOT. Despite public criticism of the government's overall response, Yingluck said she would not shake up her Cabinet -- in the short-term, at least. She explained that the focus first is to address the situation, with a full evaluation and possible shuffling to be done after the crisis abates, reported MCOT. Floods are an annual occurrence in the country but have been particularly acute this year, and some residents and analysts have criticized the government's response. ""Now the government is sending a mixed signal that the situation is fine, but the truth is it the situation far from over,"" political analyst Supong Limtanakul told CNN. ""It is a slow suffocating death of (the) Bangkok business area."" The city's main airport and two large industrial sites are also at risk, Supong said. Supong said the government did not have enough resources to deal with floodwaters, noting that officials had recently asked the private sector for water pumps to help drain water out of Bangkok. M.R. Sukhumbhand Paribatra, Bangkok's governor, told MCOT that it may take up to two weeks to drain water out of Bangkok's main roads, and months to drain water from smaller roads.

1654,"(CNN) -- Fifteen people have now died after consuming cantaloupe contaminated with the listeria monocytogenes bacteria, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. At least 84 people in 19 states have become ill with the bacteria, the agency said. And the number of illnesses could still grow, added the CDC, citing reporting lags and how the disease can develop slowly in some people. On Tuesday, the CDC was reporting 13 deaths and 72 illnesses in what was already then the deadliest food-borne illness outbreak in the United States since 1998. Five people have died in New Mexico from eating the tainted cantaloupes, the CDC said. Three people died in Colorado, two in Texas and one each in Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma. Illnesses have also been reported in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. What you need to know about Listeria . Most of those who fell ill are more than 60 years old, the CDC said. Doctors also are closely monitoring the pregnancies of two women who ate contaminated cantaloupe, with the agency noting that listeriosis can cause miscarriages and stillbirths. Older adults and people with compromised immune systems are also especially susceptible. Public health investigators have traced the source of the bacteria to a farm in Granada, Colorado. Food Poisoning 101 . The grower, Jensen Farms, issued a recall for its Rocky Ford-brand cantaloupes on September 14. By now, the cantaloupes should all be off store shelves, the CDC said. The agency warned that people should not eat Rocky Ford cantaloupes, even if they have eaten part of one and have not yet fallen ill. It also said that consumers should be wary of eating any cantaloupes if they don't know where they came from.

1655,"Atlanta (CNN) -- Nearly 700 patients and 100 employees at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta have been exposed to tuberculosis after coming in contact with a hospital employee carrying the disease, a hospital spokesman said Thursday. The Georgia Department of Community Health and the hospital have identified 680 patients who were exposed to tuberculosis between November and February, said hospital spokesman Lance Skelly. Patients will begin getting tested for tuberculosis next week, Skelly said. To date, no patients or employees have reported symptoms of tuberculosis, he said. The hospital and the department began notifying people about the exposure this month, after an Emory employee was diagnosed in April with the infectious disease, he said. The employee did not know he had tuberculosis when he came in contact with employees and patients, the hospital said. The hospital took extra precautions by contacting patients who were in the hospital for 90 days before the day the employee is known to have developed the disease, Skelly said. ""That is a major reason the numbers are so much higher."" All hospital employees are screened for the disease and must receive screenings each year, it added. A hospital statement did not say whether the employee had been screened. About 11 million people in the United States are infected with latent tuberculosis, which is symptom-free and is not contagious. Of those, 5 to 10 percent go on to develop active tuberculosis, which can be spread to others through the air, such as through coughing or sneezing.  It can be fatal if not properly treated. Symptoms of tuberculosis include chest pain, a bad cough (possibly with blood), weakness and a fever. While tuberculosis usually impacts the lungs, the kidneys, brain and spine may also be affected. Both the number and rate of tuberculosis cases has been on the decline since 1993, according to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The number of reported deaths nationwide dropped from 644 in 2006 to 544 in 2007, the most recent year for which such data is available, the CDC said.","NEW: Number and rate of TB cases has been on the decline since 1993, CDC says .

1656,"(CNN) -- The saga of Jack the cat, the lost pet that roamed New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for weeks before being found last month, has an unhappy ending. The feline had to be euthanized Sunday evening, American Airlines announced on Facebook, where the cat's plight has attracted thousands of followers. ""We are deeply saddened that Jack the cat has passed away, and we offer profound sympathy to Jack's owner, Karen Pascoe, for her loss,"" the airline wrote. ""From all of us at American, our sincere apologies to Karen and Jack's family and friends."" It was less than two weeks ago the airline announced that Jack had turned up in Kennedy's customs room after being missing for two months. The carrier originally described him as ""well,"" but a health check revealed a number of problems. ""Jack had extensive wounds on the back of his body, and the wounds were unable to heal because his skin had deteriorated due to the malnutrition that occurred while he was lost,"" said Pascoe's friends in a post on ""Jack The Cat is Lost in AA Baggage at JFK,"" the Facebook page devoted to the cat, which has more than 24,000 followers. ""Jack had been through so much, and the last thing anyone wanted was for him to suffer more."" The saga started August 25 when Pascoe was flying from New York to San Francisco with Jack and a second cat as part of a job relocation. But Jack escaped his kennel and was last seen at Kennedy's inbound baggage claim. (A Department of Transportation Pet Incident Report released last month explains how it happened: A clerk placed one kennel on top of another on a baggage cart and the kennel on top fell. The impact ""caused the kennel to separate,"" allowing the cat to escape.) When a search failed to turn up Jack after a few days, Pascoe became frustrated with American and started the Facebook page ""to help us put pressure on AA to step up their efforts."" She also urged fliers to ""do whatever they can do to keep their animals out of cargo."" The airline said it did everything it could to find Jack. While the cat was missing, workers placed food and water around the airport and set up humane traps. American even hired a pet detective and issued a pet Amber Alert in hopes of locating the feline. When Jack was found, the airline promised to cover his veterinary bills. The cat's owner hopes Jack's death will spur improvements in how airlines transport pets ""so that no one else ever has to go through this again,"" her supporters wrote on Facebook.","Jack, the lost cat who roamed an airport for two months, has been euthanized .

1657,"(CNN) -- Thai authorities are considering the construction of a super-express waterway through Bangkok to prevent future floods similar to the one that has crippled the Thai capital and brought manufacturing in other parts of the country to a standstill. A team of disaster experts from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok is now investigating permanent solutions to the disaster that has left hundreds dead. ""One of the urgent solutions is a super-express floodway,"" Thanawat Jarupongsakul, from the university's Unit for Disaster and Land Information Studies, told the Bangkok Post. Under the plan, existing natural canals -- some of them more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) long -- would be linked in a 200-km ""super-highway"" that would divert the course of floodwaters from the north. The super-canal would hold 1.6 billion cubic meters of water and drain run-off at a rate of 6,000 cubic meters per second -- the equivalent of two and a half Olympic-sized swimming pools a second. ""This idea is much cheaper than digging a new river as a floodway,"" Thanawat said. He said the proposed scheme would involve the construction of a kilometer-wide exclusion zone next to the floodway to prevent properties from being inundated, and a raised highway on both side of the canal. The super-express floodway would then drain upstream run-off directly into the sea. The university team is also looking at other flood-prevention measures such as a better early-warning system, improved water resource management, a flood tax, the use of a flood-risk map for urban development and groundwater-use controls. ""Now, the government must stop [trying to] solve flood problems with political methods,"" Thanawat told the Bangkok Post. He said poor water management rather than excess rain had caused this year's severe flooding, adding that natural swamps in the west of Thailand's Central Plains, which once absorbed water flow, had been developed into industrial and residential areas, blocking the natural floodway. While giant flood tunnels in the Bangkok metropolitan area could drain floodwater from the city, they could not cope with a massive inundation from the north. ""If there is no step forward, foreign investors will eventually disappear from the country and the next generation will be still worried whether flooding will happen or not,"" he said.","Thai authorities consider super-express waterway to prevent future floods .

1658,"(CNN) -- Japanese protesters took to the streets Saturday to demand safer energy as the nation marked the three-month anniversary of an earthquake and tsunami that sparked the worst nuclear crisis in 25 years. The massive quake on March 11 triggered a nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, forcing the evacuation of thousands. Months later, crews are still working to control radioactive emissions. ""We need electricity, but we cannot put lives at risk,"" said Kentaro Morisawa, a railway worker who took part in the Tokyo protest. ""We have the responsibility to protect our children's lives as much as our lives. Safer energy, such as fuel and water, is what we need today. Crowds sang, chanted and beat drums in protests held nationwide. ""Because we are letting radioactive material leak into the environment, we are getting a bad reputation from overseas,"" protester Mamoru Matsuda said. ""So we need to end this Fukushima crisis as soon as possible."" Some of the protesters gathered near the headquarters the Tokyo Electric Power Co., which operates the nuclear plant. The protests comes three months into the crisis, which is the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. One of three operating reactors at the plant melted down after the March earthquake and tsunami, and others suffered extensive damage to their radioactive cores. The resulting contamination has forced authorities to evacuate more than 100,000 people from towns surrounding the plant. In addition, restrictions on various agricultural and fisheries products have devastated Japanese farmers and fishermen since the disaster started, though some of those bans have been lifted in recent weeks.

1659,"(CNN) -- A fast-moving brush fire burning just south of Reno, Nevada, on Thursday prompted evacuations, closed a major highway and led the governor of Nevada to declare a state of emergency. The more than 3,000-acre fire began burning around 1 p.m. Thursday in North Washoe Valley, according to a press release from county officials. At least 10,000 people have been evacuated. There was no containment on the blaze, said Nancy Leuenhagen, Washoe County press Iinformation officer. Video from CNN Reno affiliate KOLO showed dark smoke plumes, fueled by heavy wind and dry vegetation, pushing toward U.S. Highway 395. A 12-mile stretch of the highway remained closed late Thursday, according to Dan Lopez of the Nevada Highway Patrol. Several flights at the Reno airport have been canceled or diverted, CNN affiliate KTVN reported. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been and are being affected by this fire,"" Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval said in a statement. ""Declaring a state of emergency ensures that every resource from the local, state and federal level is available to assist."" The Nevada Division of Forestry and the Department of Public Safety were aiding local firefighters and emergency personnel, Sandoval said. The National Guard was on standby and the state of California was also providing assistance, according to the governor's website. About 12 families displaced by the fire were receiving assistance at an evacuation shelter at a local high school, said Karli Epstien, Red Cross press information officer.

1660,"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities deployed more than 1,000 additional police officers to reinforce security at the capital's 175 subway stations on Saturday, a day after a shooting inside a station left two people dead and eight injured at the height of evening rush hour. Camera footage shows Luis Felipe Hernandez Castillo brandishing a gun. The shooting at the Balderas station in central Mexico City happened after police stopped Luis Felipe Hernandez Castillo, 38, from writing graffiti on the wall of one of the subway platforms. Five of the injured suffered gunshot wounds, and three others were hurt by the stampeding crowds, officials said. Hernandez Castillo was writing ""Este gobierno de criminales,"" or ""this government of criminals,"" Mexico City district attorney Miguel Angel Mancera said. As police tried to stop him, Hernandez Castillo drew a .38 special handgun and began firing. Mancera said his first impression of Hernandez Castillo is that he may suffer from mental illness. ""One moment he is talking about global warming and then about the message of the Bible and suddenly he focuses on some government,"" Mancera said. Authorities identified Hernandez Castillo as an agriculturalist from the state of Jalisco. Hernandez Castillo also told investigators that he believed a great famine would come, and he traveled to Mexico City to relay a message, Mancera said. Earlier this month, a Bolivian pastor hijacked a passenger jet in Mexico City with a fake bomb, claiming that he acted on a divine revelation to warn people of a forthcoming earthquake. Mancera said Hernandez Castillo was aware of the hijacking, but that the two events were not connected. Hernandez Castillo said he opened fire because he saw the police as a threat to his task of writing on the wall, Mancera said. Preliminary tests show that Hernandez Castillo was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the incident, Mancera said. The Mexican government on Saturday posted security camera footage of the shooting. It shows a busy subway platform as the train pulls into the station just before 5:15 p.m. Friday. As the train comes to a stop, there is a disturbance in the crowd, and Hernandez Castillo is seen shooting at an officer.  Watch the dramatic incident unfold » . The crowd disperses, and the officer runs out of view of the camera. The officer, who was a bank policeman, is later seen on the footage lying dead, face down on the platform. Authorities identified the officer as Victor Manuel Miranda Martinez. The footage shows a man in a white shirt running off the train and trying to wrestle Hernandez Castillo. The man chases Hernandez Castillo around the platform. He frequently falls either because he slips or is trying to avoid being shot. The man is on the floor facing Hernandez Castillo, about to get up and try to grab him, when he is shot in the head and falls to the ground. Mancera initially said the man was a federal security agent in plain clothes, but later clarified that the man was a civilian, a 58-year-old construction worker. A scattered handful of people remain on the subway platform during the shooting. Some stay on the train. Others walk on the platform very close to the shooter, seemingly undisturbed. Seven minutes later, the camera pans out to show the construction worker lying on his back and the bank police officer in the foreground. Hernandez Castillo remains on the train, occasionally firing his gun and peeking out of the train. At 5:23 p.m., the camera shows first one, then two, then three plain-clothes police getting into position on the platform. Within moments they rush Hernandez Castillo and pull him out of the train, with nearly a dozen police officers then wrestling him to the ground. Hernandez Castillo was treated at a hospital for a bullet wound to the right shoulder before being transferred to the local attorney general's office, a common place to hold prisoners during preliminary investigations, a spokesman for the attorney general said. He faces two counts of murder and one count each of attempted murder, aggression, resisting arrest and disturbing the peace, said the spokesman, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the press.

1661,"(CNN) -- A man stranded after his car plunged down a steep embankment in the Angeles National Forest survived for six days by eating leaves and drinking water from a creek, authorities said Friday. David J. Lavau, 67, of Lake Hughes, California, was found in a ravine a week after losing control of his car on a rural road and plunging 500 feet down an embankment into heavy brush, according to a report by the California Highway Patrol. Lavau, who is partially disabled, told authorities that he spent the first night in his car. ""The next morning, he exited his vehicle and observed another vehicle adjacent to his own with a deceased male driver behind the wheel,"" the report said. ""The deceased appeared to have been there for some time."" Authorities say they have not identified the dead driver. The case began to unfold on September 23, when Lavau failed to return home. Lavau's family began searching for him when he failed to return home, driving the route and stopping at all the curves in the road from Castaic to his home in Lake Hughes. While Lavau's family searched for him, he ""remained at the bottom of the hill surviving on leaves and water from a nearby creek,"" the report said. Lavau's son, Sean, found his father after hearing ""faint yells for help on the roadway from the canyon below,"" according to the report. Sean Lavau hiked to the bottom of the canyon to find his father, the report said. The Los Angeles County Fire Department rescued Lavau and his son from the ravine. Lavau was taken to an area hospital where he was treated for moderate injuries, the report said. The CHP said Lavau's accident and the one involving the dead driver are under investigation.

Two children and a 3-month-old baby were among the victims. Two sisters, 9 and 14, were killed inside a mobile home, Choctaw County Coroner Keith Coleman told CNN. The tornado tore a path nearly a mile wide and decimated neighborhoods as it raked cities from the central western border with Louisiana northeastward to Alabama. It leveled a church, sheared roofs off houses, overturned cars, snapped down hundreds of trees and plunged large swaths of the state in darkness as it toppled power lines. The same storm system that unleashed Saturday's twister delivered severe weather to other parts of the South on Sunday, with tornadoes hitting Alabama and South Carolina. On Sunday, a tornado in Darlington County in northern South Carolina overturned as many as four mobile homes and toppled trees and downed power lines. Three people were hospitalized with minor injuries, according to Linwood Epps of the county's emergency management agency. He said that the local Cain Elementary school was damaged, with part of its roof missing. The National Weather Service on Sunday gave the Mississippi tornado a preliminary rating of at least 3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale of 0-5, with wind speeds of up to 160 miles per hour and a preliminary path width of one and a half miles. Were you affected by the tornado? Send in pics, video . Ron Sullivan, a store owner in Choctaw County, said he was lucky to be alive after the storm hit around midday Saturday. ""They always talk about you hearing the train,"" Sullivan told CNN. ""There was no train. There was a bomb."" He said two customers were walking toward the door of his store when the tornado struck and that ""when they opened the door, it hit and blew me back."" ""The only thing that went through my mind were two things -- 'Please don't let anything else fall on me' and 'I hope my wife is OK,' "" Sullivan said. The hardest-hit counties were Yazoo and Choctaw, where assessment and rescue crews continued operations Sunday, though a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said there weren't any specific reports of people trapped inside the rubble. Authorities had recorded at least 681 homes damaged across six counties, according to MEMA spokesman Greg Flynn. The agency was reporting 33 injuries, but it hadn't received counts from Yazoo and Choctaw counties. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said he has not yet requested emergency federal aid but plans to do so on Monday. Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were scheduled to arrive Monday, anticipating an application for a disaster declaration, Flynn said. Nearly 80 Mississippi National Guard troops, including 50 military police, had been deployed to Choctaw and Yazoo counties, MEMA reported. Forty highway safety patrol troops were also sent to the affected areas. Five of the dead were from Choctaw County, in the north central part of the state; four were from Yazoo County, north of Jackson; and one was from Holmes County, also in north central Mississippi, said Flynn. Barbour, who was in Yazoo City where his home is located, called the twister gigantic and said that ""in places (it) seemed to be to be several miles wide."" Only 38 people stayed overnight in shelters in Yazoo City, Flynn said, adding that most of the affected were able to stay with family or friends. Mississippi residents shared stories of tragedy and survival on Sunday. ""You could just feel the glass and debris flying in and cutting you,"" said Stacy Walker, who took cover in a hair salon in Yazoo City where she worked. ""It felt like minutes and minutes. but I'm sure it was just seconds the time that it lasted."" Walker made it out safe but later learned that a high school friend died protecting her children. Dale Thrasher was inside Yazoo City's Hillcrest Baptist Church when it was flattened by the tornado. ""I went in the sanctuary and got under the pulpit table and the whole building fell around me,"" he said. His injuries: ""Three little scratches."" In all, 12 counties reported injuries, with some of the injured airlifted to a level one trauma center at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. Local coverage from CNN affiliate WAPT . President Obama has ""been briefed on the tragedy in Mississippi and the situation is being followed by the White House,"" Obama spokesman Bill Burton said. Mississippi residents reported that the path of the twister was a half-mile to a mile wide, said Mark McAllister, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Jackson. CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said the twister  had traveled 150 miles across Mississippi, starting in the western part of the state and moving northeast before weakening as it moved into Alabama. Early Sunday morning, Alabama's emergency management officials confirmed a tornado touched down in Marshall County in the state's north. At least one mobile home park and some homes in Albertville were destroyed, said CNN affiliate WAFF in Huntsville, Alabama. On Sunday, Nancy Brooks surveyed the damage to her Albertville home, which was extensive. Part of home's roof was blown off, and debris littered the floors, which were now barely visible. Brooks awoke to the sound of the incoming tornado, only to witness a moment later a large tree branch rip into her bedroom just feet from where she sleeps. ""I'm very lucky, I'm very fortunate,"" she said, as friends helped her begin the cleanup process. Saturday's tornado was part of a broad band of storms that stretched from Missouri to the panhandle of Florida, Jeras said.

1664,"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- A 69-year-old who was previously convicted of torching a palace has been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed Namdaemun, South Korea's oldest wooden structure and a national treasure, authorities said on Tuesday. People on Monday look at the debris of the Namdaemun gate in central Seoul after the fire. Similarities between the Sunday night fire and the 2006 blaze led to the investigation of a man identified only as Mr. Chae, said Kim Young-Su, chief of police of the Namdaemun police station. Chae had served time in prison for the palace fire. Police searched the home of Chae's ex-wife and found a can of paint thinner and a pair of leather gloves they believe were used in the fire, Kim said. Chae confessed to starting the fire, saying he was upset by a land grievance that led him to start the 2006 fire and by the sentence he was handed in that case, Kim said. Chae was free on a suspended sentence, Kim added. Chae said he chose Namdaemun because it was easily accessible by public transportation and yet situated in a lightly populated area where the fire was unlikely to hurt people, according to police. The fire burned for hours, and more than a hundred firefighters tried to save it.  Watch the reaction to the Namdaemun's destruction » . Namdaemun was more than 600 years old and stood at the center of Seoul, having served as a main gate into the capital for centuries. The gate was considered a national symbol to Koreans around the world. E-mail to a friend .","NEW: ""Mr. Chae"" was convicted of torching a Korean palace in 2006 .

1665,"(CNN) -- Six people were killed and six were injured when a small plane crashed at Cork Airport in southern Ireland on Thursday, local officials said. Survivors were taken to a local hospital, the Cork County Council said. Four of the injured are in serious but not critical condition, and the other two are ""comfortable,"" Cork University Hospital said. The crash caused a fire and scattered debris over a large area, the Irish Aviation Authority said in a statement. The plane crashed on its third attempt to land in low visibility, they said. The airport and roads around it were closed, officials said. It was coming from Belfast in Northern Ireland. Flight NM7100, an inbound Manx2 airline flight, was due to land at Cork Airport at 9:45 a.m., the airport said. Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness expressed shock at the deaths. Robinson called it ""a terrible tragedy,"" and said his thoughts were ""with the families of the bereaved. My thoughts are also with the injured and I hope that they will make a full and speedy recovery."" McGuinness sent his ""condolences to the families, friends and loved ones of those who have lost their lives in the plane crash. My thoughts are also with those who have been injured."" In Dublin, Ireland's Prime Minister Brian Cowen said, ""my thoughts are with all of those affected by this morning's crash, including the families and friends of those who have died. I also want to send my best wishes and those of the government, to all of those who survived the crash and are being treated in hospital at present. ""I also want to commend the work of the various rescue crews and all of the emergency and support staff working to help those involved in the crash."" The aircraft involved was a Metro Liner leased from Flightline BCN in Spain, low-cost airline Manx2 said. Irish and British experts will be involved in the crash investigation, authorities said.

1666,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal transportation safety officials Wednesday issued an ""urgent"" recommendation calling for a redesign of a component on some Boeing 777 aircraft engines -- a component blamed for two major mishaps in the past year. The engines on this British Airways jet lost power as it prepared to land in London on January 17, 2008. National Transportation Safety Board investigators said the Rolls-Royce engine component played a role in the January 17, 2008, crash of a British Airways jet near London's Heathrow Airport. Both the plane's engines lost power as the plane approached the runway, and 13 people were injured in the resulting crash. Ten months later, on November 26, 2008, a Delta Air Lines Boeing 777 was in cruise flight over Montana when an engine lost power. That plane landed safely in Atlanta after pilots performed a procedure developed in response to the Heathrow crash. In both cases, the NTSB said, a build-up of ice on a fuel/oil heat exchanger restricted the flow of fuel to the Rolls-Royce engines, reducing power. ""With two of these rollback events occurring within a year, we believe that there is a high probability of something similar happening again,"" NTSB Acting Chairman Mark Rosenker said in a news release. The Federal Aviation Administration recently ordered operators of Boeing 777s that use the Rolls Royce engines to revise flight manuals to give pilots procedures to follow in certain cold weather conditions, outlining steps they should take if their jets experience a reduction of power. But the NTSB said Wednesday the FAA action does not go far enough. ""The procedure has worked and it has been effective in significantly reducing the likelihood [of an incident],"" said NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson. ""But that's not enough. We need a permanent fix."" While the emergency procedures work, they add to the complexity of flying the plane and require a descent, which could be hazardous if the plane is not at a sufficient altitude, the NTSB said. Some 56 aircraft in the U.S. fleet and a total of 228 worldwide are equipped with Rolls-Royce engines. But the NTSB stopped short of recommending the planes be grounded. Knudson said the safety board believes the new procedures will significantly address the problem until Rolls-Royce has a new component ready for installation. Rolls-Royce indicated it can have a new system ready within 12 months, the NTSB said. ""We are encouraged to see that Rolls-Royce is already working on a redesign, and we are confident that with the FAA and EASA [European Aviation Safety Agency] overseeing the process, this flight safety issue -- even one as complex as this -- will be successfully and expeditiously resolved,"" Rosenker said. The NTSB recommended that, once Rolls-Royce completes its redesign, the new system be installed on all affected Boeing 777's at their next maintenance check or within six months. A Rolls-Royce spokesman said: ""The report clearly states that the Rolls-Royce equipment on this flight met or exceeded all requirements. The report also highlights the emerging issue of ice build up in commercial 'long-cold-high' routes. This is an industry-wide issue which requires detailed research that is likely to shape future regulations and requirements."" ""This has been a serious matter for both Boeing, and the airlines who use the 777 with Rolls Royce engines,"" said Richard Quest, CNN's aviation correspondent . ""The development of a permanent mechanical fix will solve the problem. Until then pilots operating the plane will be on their guard for any signs of the problems re-occurring. That said, the plane remains safe to fly, otherwise it would have been grounded by the authorities.""","Safety Board urges quick fix for Boeing 777 engine problem .

1667,"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Paula pushed across western Cuba Thursday evening with wind gusts just under hurricane strength in some places, bringing heavy rain and high winds to the island nation, forecasters said. The storm is gradually weakening and is expected to become a tropical depression Friday, the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center said . As of 8 p.m. ET, the center of Paula was about 25 miles (45 kilometers) east of Havana, the center said. It was moving east at 14 mph (22 kph). Paula passed just south of the Cuban capital around 6 p.m. Thursday -- with sustained winds of 41 mph (67 kph) and a gust of 54 mph (87 kph) recorded in Havana -- after making landfall at about noon near Puerto Esperanza. The storm's maximum sustained winds have weakened to 55 mph (90 kph), the center said Thursday night, but wind gusts of 68 mph had been recorded earlier near Puerto Esperanza. Stronger gusts were confined to a small area near the storm's center, the center said. Paula's tropical storm-force winds have expanded to 70 miles (110 km) outward from the center, altering the landscape of a storm that has been roughly half that size for most of its duration. Forecasters said the storm was likely to stick to an east to east-northeast track, moving across western and central Cuba Thursday night and Friday. The hurricane center said that tropical storm force winds should continue to spread eastward across western and central Cuba Thursday night, primarily along the north coast. The center discontinued an earlier tropical storm watch also was for the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. Emergency management officials in the Keys said Wednesday they were keeping an eye on the progress of Paula and expected some gusty winds and rain, but no protective actions had been initiated. Forecasters predict the center of Paula will remain south of the Keys. Paula is likely to dump an additional 2 to 4 inches of rain over portions of western and central Cuba over the next two days, the National Hurricane Center said. Total maximum amounts could be 10 inches in some areas. Heavy rain could trigger flash floods and mudslides, forecasters said. The Florida Keys could see between 1 and 2 inches of rain. In addition, a storm surge is forecast to raise water levels by 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba, accompanied by ""large and destructive waves,"" the hurricane center said.","NEW: Storm is gradually weakening, with maximum sustained winds of 55 mph (90 kph)

1668,"(CNN) -- Nearly four months after a P-51 Mustang veered out of control and slammed into spectators at the Reno, Nevada, air races -- killing 11 people, injuring scores of others and jeopardizing the future of the event -- race organizers Wednesday said the show will go on. The head of the Reno Air Racing Association said the association will seek permits for the full schedule of races to take place September 12-16 and is confident that it will get them. If not, he said, organizers will stage a one-time-only memorial event to commemorate those killed and injured last year, and will bring an end to the 49-year-old tradition. ""Many of the victims, their families, air race teams and fans have told us they're coming to Reno this September no matter what,"" said Mike Houghton, president and CEO of the Reno Air Racing Association, at a Reno press conference. ""And we feel it's our obligation to give them something, no matter what."" Houghton said the association is doing everything possible to assure that all features of the races will continue, including the unlimited class race, which featuring planes flying at low altitudes in excess of 500 mph. It was unclear how close spectators would be allowed and whether that would include areas in which they were killed or hurt in the September crash. The event relies on the races to attract its 200,000 fans, who contribute an estimated $85 million to the local economy, Houghton said, and it would not be economically viable as a more traditional air show. In an apparent effort to win government support for the races, the association created a ""blue ribbon review panel"" that included two well-known former government officials, former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Jim Hall and former Federal Aviation Administration official Nick Sabatini. The panel will review changes that can be made to ensure the races' safety, Houghton said. The September 15, 2011, crash came when noted pilot James Leeward's Mustang flew off course, pitching upward briefly before flying into a spectator area. Leeward and 10 spectators died, and about 60 people were injured. The NTSB is investigating the cause of the crash and is examining video that shows a piece of trim tab, an aerodynamic surface on the tail of the plane, separating from the plane at the time the pilot lost control. The crash also has prompted the NTSB to hold a one-day hearing on air show safety. That hearing will be held Tuesday in Washington. Houghton said the race sponsors, vendors and pilots he has met have ""universally"" expressed support for continuing the races, and that fan support has been ""overwhelming."" Fewer then 20% of the fans asked for refunds from the races canceled after last year's crash, he said. Houghton said the association needs permits or waivers from the FAA, the local airport authority and the city of Reno. He expressed optimism that all three entities would permit the races, but said his biggest concern is any unknown obstacle that could interfere with race plans. The crash is expected to bring a flurry of lawsuits. In a lawsuit filed by the family of deceased spectator Craig Salerno of Friendswood, Texas, lawyers argued the crash was not a ""freak accident,"" but was ""the predictable result of a reckless drive for speed by a risk-taking pilot and crew, coupled with an insatiable drive for profit"" by race organizers. The FAA said it has revised its air race policy to require all air racing organizations to go through a standardized accreditation process to ensure all air race organizations are subjected to the same review and authorization standards. The FAA said it has invited the Reno Air Racing Association to contact it when it is ready to begin the accreditation process. Once the FAA receives that notification, the FAA will select a team that will conduct a top-to-bottom review of the organization's operations, the agency said. In the 49 years of racing at Reno, 19 pilots have died in crashes. Last year's crash is believed to be the first to kill spectators.","11 people died in September when racing plane crashed into spectators .

1669,"(CNN) -- Dozens of people have been killed in Central America as heavy rains continue to hammer the region. In Guatemala, the death toll has risen to 28 and close to 110,000 people have been affected so far, the state-run AGN news agency reported. Citing the president, the agency said 15,000 more people are at risk and roughly 12,000 are in shelters. ""We've been able to respond to all the requests for help we've received -- many by land because we haven't been able to fly over the areas,"" said President Alvaro Colom, AGN reported. Meanwhile in El Salvador, the government has declared a state of emergency and ordered evacuations in some of the hardest-hit areas. At least 24 have died in El Salvador, including seven children, according to the country's civil protection director. Some 13,000 people are in shelters. Central America has been hammered by torrential rain since last week, when Hurricane Jova struck Mexico as a Category 2 storm late Tuesday. It weakened into a tropical storm and then a tropical depression as it moved over western Mexico. More rain in the region is forecast. CNN's Claudia Dominguez and journalist Merlin del Cid contributed to this report.","At least 28 people are reported dead in Guatemala .

1670,"(CNN) -- A plane crashed early Sunday in the southern port city of Karachi, killing at least eight people on board and sending flames shooting through the night sky, a Pakistani official said. The cargo plane took off at 1:45 a.m. from the Jinnah Karachi International Airport for Khartoum, Sudan, said Pervez George, a spokesman for Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority. It went down a few minutes later in the Gulistan-e Johar section of Karachi, an area where many Pakistani naval officers live. Masood Raza, a Karachi district government official, told CNN affiliate GEO News in Pakistan that the pilot appeared to deliberately bring the plane down in a less densely populated residential area in order to save lives. ""If the plane would have crashed in a (more crowded) residential area, it would have been a very big disaster for the city of Karachi,"" Raza said. All eight people confirmed dead were members of the downed aircraft's crew and all are Russian nationals, said George. A local hospital spokesman told CNN that the hospital had received five bodies by 4 a.m. The Russian-made cargo plane was carrying relief supplies, including tents, to Africa before it went down. The plane arrived in Karachi on Saturday from Fujairah, United Arab Emirates, George said. An eyewitness told CNN that he saw fire on one of the plane's wings before it crashed. Firefighters, rescue personnel and area residents rushed to the scene, with jet fuel fanning the large flames and huge plumes of smoke. The blaze was put out by 4 a.m., according to George, at which point rescue personnel continued to comb through the rubble looking for other people possibly killed or hurt. The plane appeared to hit several buildings under construction. Hospital sources told GEO News that Mohammed Raees had burns over 60 percent of his body, resulting from the crash and subsequent fire. Raees told GEO News that he was hurt after flaming parts of a building hit him and the motorcyle he was preparing to ride.","NEW: Official says the pilot saved lives by guiding the plane to a less crowded area .

1671,"Atlanta (CNN) -- Engine problems forced the pilot of a Delta Air Lines aircraft to turn back Thursday night shortly after takeoff from Atlanta, the company said Friday. The aircraft returned to Atlanta without incident, spokeswoman Gina Laughlin said. Passengers aboard Flight 1442 from Atlanta to Charlotte, North Carolina, told CNN affiliate WSOC that they had been airborne about 10 or 20 minutes when one of the engines appeared to catch on fire. Laughlin could not confirm the report of flames, but said crew members reported smoke in the cabin following the incident. Passenger Ginger Heath said the incident began with a shaking sensation, followed by ""sparks, a great big boom and lots and lots of fire"" from the engine. ""After that smoke starting coming out of the air vents."" Other passengers told CNN affiliate WBTV that they heard a ""huge crashing sound"" and felt what seemed like ""bad turbulence."" ""I kind of thought I was going to die for a second,"" one passenger interviewed by WBTV said. ""A couple of people got hysterical,"" passenger Atiim Browne told WSOC. ""The lady behind me was crying. A couple of people kind of looked at it, you know, as life flashing before their eyes and stuff like that. But again we got back on the floor within a couple of minutes so it wasn't too bad."" Delta mechanics were inspecting the aircraft Friday, Laughlin said.

1672,"(CNN) -- Tests detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 U.S. Navy helicopter crew members when they returned to the USS Ronald Reagan after conducting disaster relief missions in Japan, the military said Monday. No further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water, the Navy said. In addition, the Navy said the U.S. 7th Fleet has temporarily repositioned its ships and planes away from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after detecting low-level contamination in the air and on its planes in the area, the Navy said. One ship was operating about 100 miles northeast of the power plant when ""airborne radioactivity"" was detected, the Navy said. The Navy's statement, however, provided some perspective, noting that the maximum potential radiation dose received by personnel when the ship passed through the area was ""less than the radiation exposure received from about one month of exposure to natural background radiation from sources such as rocks, soil, and the sun."" On Sunday, the USS Ronald Reagan started delivering aid in the coastal regions of Japan's Miyagi prefecture. Crew members, in conjunction with the Japan Maritime Self Defense Forces, conducted 20 sorties delivering aid pallets. Eight U.S. and Japanese helicopters were used to distribute the pallets, according to Sgt. Maj. Stephen Valley of U.S. Forces Japan. Workers are scrambling to cool down fuel rods and prevent a full meltdown in three reactors at the earthquake-hit plant. Radioactive steam has been released, intentionally to lessen growing pressure in the reactors.","The Navy says washing with soap and water removed the radioactivity .

1674,"(CNN) -- The family of boxing great Joe Frazier on Wednesday announced details of his Philadelphia funeral services and said he died as ""one of God's men."" Frazier, who handed the legendary Muhammad Ali his first defeat, died Monday, just a month after being diagnosed with liver cancer. The 67-year-old athlete's remains will be in public view at the Wells Fargo Center from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. Saturday, the family said. ""This will be an opportunity for his many fans, supporters and boxing lovers from around the world to pay their final respects to Joe Frazier."" The service will be held at 11 a.m. Monday at Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church. ""The Family of Joe Frazier continues to stress that they want everyone to know that Joe Frazier was a man of God and a man who loved all of his family,"" relatives said in a statement. Star boxer Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather offered to pay for Frazier's funeral. The family said donations in Frazier's memory can be made to the American Cancer Society. The former heavyweight champion became a legend in his own right and personified the gritty working-class style of his hard-knuckled hometown, Philadelphia -- a fitting setting for the ""Rocky"" film series, starring Sylvester Stallone as hardscrabble boxer Rocky Balboa. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter called Frazier the ""quintessential Philadelphia boxer."" ""You could hear him coming, snorting and grunting and puffing, like a steam engine climbing a steep grade,"" Bill Lyon wrote in a Philadelphia Inquirer column about Frazier, nicknamed ""Smokin' Joe."" Frazier used his devastating left hook with impunity during his professional career, retiring in 1976 with a 32-4-1 record and staging one last comeback fight in 1981. Frazier bested Ali at 1971's ""Fight of the Century"" at Madison Square Garden. In the 15th round, Frazier landed perhaps the most famous left hook in history, catching Ali on the jaw and dropping the former champ for a four-count, according to Frazier's bio at the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Frazier left the ring as the undisputed champ and handed Ali his first professional loss. Ali won a 12-round decision in a January 1974 rematch, setting the stage for the classic ""Thrilla in Manila"" just outside the Philippine capital in 1975. Ali took the early rounds, but Frazier rebounded before losing the last five rounds. By the end of the 14th, Frazier's eyes were nearly swollen shut, and his corner stopped the bout, according to the biography. Frazier, a two-time heavyweight champion for nearly three years until he lost in January 1973 to George Foreman, ran a well-known boxing gym in Philadelphia for years.","Services are scheduled for Monday in Philadelphia .

1675,"(CNN) -- A powerful and dangerous Bering Sea storm prepared to slam Alaska's west coast late Tuesday, bringing a brutal mix of high seas, blizzard conditions and strong winds, the National Weather Service said. Sustained winds in some areas are expected to reach up to hurricane-force levels of 75 and 80 miles per hour, with higher gusts possible, meteorologist Stephen Kearney told CNN. Nome, with a population of about 3,700, will endure sea levels 7 to 8 feet above normal, with occasional 10-foot waves, he said. Chip Leeper, incident commander with the Nome government, said people in low-lying areas and on the edges of a sea wall are being advised to seek shelter elsewhere. There were no mandatory evacuations late Tuesday. While the town was taking the matter seriously, residents were taking things in stride. ""Most people are a hardy lot,"" Leeper told CNN. ""We don't scare easy."" Forecasters said the storm would cross the Chukotsk Peninsula and take a northwestern track into the Chukchi Sea on Wednesday. Widespread flooding and severe beach erosion are expected in several areas, including Norton Sound. While fall storms happen, this one has officials particularly concerned because of the anticipated coastal flooding. Usually, the less-populated Aleutian Islands to the south are most affected. The U.S. Coast Guard said it had moved helicopters into positions to assist. ""We are prestaging helicopters from Air Station Kodiak to parts of Western Alaska in response to severe weather advisories, including hurricane force winds and high seas that are forecast all along the west coast of Alaska,"" said Capt. Daniel Travers, Coast Guard District 17 chief of incident management. A 143-foot fishing trawler, Rebecca Irene, had lost an engine in the Bering Sea and Coast Guard crews were preparing to remove non-essential personnel, the Coast Guard said in a statement . The mayor of Point Hope, an Inupait village, told CNN Fairbanks affiliate KTVF the community was prepared.

1676,"(CNN) -- Two idyllic South Pacific islands are facing a water crisis; they're running out of it, and fast. The island nations Tuvalu and Tokelau have declared states of emergency after six months of little or no rainfall. It's estimated that at the current rate of consumption the Tuvaluan atoll of Funafuti, home to 5,000 people, will run out of drinking water in two weeks. Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand with a population of 1,500, could run dry in just one. ""We are all working in line with the fact that we recognize this national emergency situation,"" Jo Suveinakama, the general manager of the Tokelau government told Radio New Zealand. The New Zealand Red Cross flew emergency supplies to Tuvalu Monday on a New Zealand Defense Force flight along with two aid workers and two foreign ministry staff. ""We have mobilized 2,000 collapsible water containers, hand sanitizers, tarpaulins to be used to capture rain (and) two emergency desalination units,"" Andrew McKie, New Zealand Red Cross International Operations and Emergency Manager said in a statement Tuesday. The emergency desalinators are being sent south on a patrol boat at midnight Tuesday to the small atoll of Nukulaelae, part of Tuvalu, whose population of 330 is reported to be down to its last 60 liters of water. Schools have closed as residents conserve what little water they have and pray for rain. ""It's a pretty dire situation there,"" Gareth Smith, New Zealand High Commissioner to Tuvalu told Radio New Zealand. Smith is one of the two foreign ministry staff sent to Tuvalu this week. In Nukulaelae, water is being rationed. Families - some with as many as 10 people - are forced to live on just 40 liters a day, according to Dave Hebblethwaite, a water management adviser from the Applied Geoscience and Technology Division of Secretariat of the Pacific Community. ""Families are getting by washing in the sea and only having a short wash in fresh water if at all,"" he said, adding that most of the fresh water is being reserved for drinking and cooking. The Tuvalu government briefed a group known as the ""Diplomatic Corps"" Tuesday in the Fijian capital of Suva on the type of aid that might be needed. Delegates included head of foreign missions, international agencies and regional organizations. Parts for desalination units and fuel top the list, Hebblethwaite said. Tuvalu, the world's fourth smallest country, is a nation of four reef islands and five atolls covering 26 square kilometers in the Pacific Ocean halfway between Hawaii and Australia. The island nation relies almost exclusively on rainwater collected from the roofs of homes and government buildings to supply a population of 10,000. However, three dry spells over the last three years has gradually drained the community's water supplies. ""Communities in Tuvalu are pretty used to doing it tough,"" Hebblethwaite said. ""Atoll environments are really hard environments to live in and when you're just relying on rainfall for all of your water, you find yourself in situations where you do need to make the most of every small amount. ""For these communities to be asking for external assistance, it shows that the situation is quite serious,"" he said. New Zealand's Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has warned the water crisis could lead to food shortages as crops fail. ""We're now doing an assessment, not just in Tuvalu but also in other areas of the Pacific that are affected by the shortage of rainfall, making sure we deal with the drinking water issue most urgently,"" he told Radio New Zealand. Tuvalu imports the bulk of its food but its people also grow their own crops, mostly taro. The root vegetable is grown in pits filled with organic matter due to the lack of soil available on the atoll. ""We know that on some of the islands, particularly on Nukalaelae, many pits are suffering damage from either drying out or getting saline from the water table. So there's certainly an impact on food security,"" Hebblethwaite said. ""We're even finding that some fruit trees are suffering, even coconuts, which is unusual. Coconut palms on Nukalaelae are starting to lose their fronds,"" he said. Tuvalu has been very vocal in its calls for international help to mitigate the effects of climate change. It has warned that it is in danger of ""sinking"" as sea water levels rise. ""The information we have about climate change and rainfall patterns is getting better and better every month,"" Hebblethwaite said. However he added that assessing long term trends on the islands was difficult to due the lack of rain gauges. ""One thing's for sure, water will be the main mechanism by which climate change impacts on these island communities, whether it be by droughts or by storms or floods,"" he said. ""So building their resistance to today's climate variability that they're experiencing will be a key defense they can employ against the future impacts of climate change, and I think people are recognizing that.""","Tuvalu and Tokelau in the South Pacific running out of drinking water .

1677,"(CNN) -- Authorities will have to await a necropsy to find out killed one of the equine world's top athletes, a stallion named Hickstead. Hickstead collapsed and died in front of hundreds of spectators at the Rolex F.E.I. World Cup in Verona, Italy, on Sunday. The Dutch Warmblood stallion completed the 13-track show jumping course and collapsed on the ground under his rider, the reigning Olympic champion and world number one Eric Lamaze. As shocked fans watched, Hickstead lay shaking on the ground for several minutes before he died. A dazed Eric Lamaze was then led out of the ring. Officials stopped the competition at the request of the riders. ""Hickstead really was a horse in a million and my heart goes out to Eric and everyone connected with this wonderful horse,"" said Princess Haya bint Al Hussein, the wife of the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and the president of the sport's governing body, Federation Equestre Internationale. ""This is a terrible loss, but Hickstead truly will never be forgotten. We were very lucky to have known him."" Lamaze rode Hickstead to win an individual gold for Canada at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and countless Grands prix and Nations Cup victories. ""Our deepest sympathies go out to the owners, to Eric and to all the connections of one of the greatest jumping horses of all time,"" said FEI Jumping Director John Roche.

1678,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Allied forces suffered a day of heavy losses in Afghanistan Friday after a helicopter crash killed six U.S. Marines and an attack killed four French soldiers, prompting Paris to consider an early troop withdrawal. The Marines died after their CH-53 helicopter crashed in Helmand province, a U.S. military official said. The NATO-led force reported no enemy activity in the area, but the Taliban claimed credit for bringing down the chopper. Separately, an Afghan soldier killed four French soldiers and injured 15 others, one critically, in eastern Afghanistan, French officials said. President Nicolas Sarkozy said he was suspending French training operations and combat help as a result. ""The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers,"" he said. France could bring its troops back early from Afghanistan if the necessary security is not restored, Sarkozy said. France has 3,935 troops in Afghanistan, according NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Sarkozy will send French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet to Afghanistan, he said. ""It was during a training session inside the base that a shooter killed four of our soldiers. This is unacceptable and demands a full investigation,"" Longuet said. A French official told CNN the French troops were unarmed as they were inside their base, conducting normal training operations with their Afghan partners. The official, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said 15 soldiers were injured. The attack in Kapisa province follows a similar shooting last month by an Afghan soldier that killed two French soldiers serving in an engineers' regiment, also in eastern Afghanistan. Friday's suspected shooter, who was a member of the Afghan National Army, has been apprehended, according to an ISAF statement. Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he was deeply saddened by incident. ""France has been generous to provide extensive assistance to Afghanistan over the past 10 years,"" Karzai said. ""Throughout history, the two countries have enjoyed a sincere relationship, which the Afghan people will always cherish."" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid called the attack ""sensible."" ""This was the latest attack by those sensible and zealous Afghans who have entered the enemy's army and it was also the best one so far as it killed more soldiers than any other such attacks before,' Mujahid said. Responding to last month's shooting, Sarkozy stressed his country's ""determination to continue working within the International Security Assistance Force to restore peace and stability in that country and contribute to its development."" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen paid tribute to those killed and injured Friday, saying it was a ""very sad day"" for ISAF troops in Afghanistan and for France. ""Such tragic incidents are terrible and grab headlines, but they are isolated,"" he said. ""The reality is that every day, 130,000 ISAF troops from 50 nations fight and train with over 300,000 Afghan soldiers. That takes a lot of trust among a lot of soldiers. ""We have the same goal. An Afghanistan that is responsible for its own security. That is what Afghans want. And we remain committed to helping Afghans."" ISAF spokesman Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings also played down the threat, saying, ""We train and are partnered with Afghan personnel every day, and we are not seeing any issues or concerns with our relationships."" Friday's shooting was the latest in a series of attacks on NATO forces by members of the Afghan army. In October, a gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform turned his weapon on coalition forces during training, killing three and wounding several others. The shooter was killed in the incident in southern Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the cause of the helicopter crash, which happened around midnight Kabul time, is still under investigation, ISAF said. There was no enemy activity in the area when the helicopter went down in Helmand, said Col. Gary Kolb, an ISAF spokesman. The Taliban claimed responsibility Friday for bringing down the helicopter. Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman, told CNN via text message: ""A Chinook was shot down in Zubair Karez area, between Musa Qala and Zamin Dawar in southern Helmand province, and a number of foreigners traveling in it were killed."" NATO is scheduled to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Many ISAF members are involved in missions to train and support Afghan forces as they prepare to take on greater security responsibilities.

1679,"Waxahachie, Texas (CNN) -- Preliminary air quality tests show ""no threat to the public"" from a massive fire at a Texas chemical plant Monday, city and federal officials said. Waxahachie Fire Chief David Hudgins said authorities believe that the fire ""overran the sprinkler system,"" and it sent thick plumes of smoke high into the sky hours after it started. There were no flames visible by late afternoon, though by then the blaze might have discharged dangerous substances into the air, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency. That prompted EPA staff to dispatch air monitors to test for toxic vapors. Around 4:45 p.m. (5:45 p.m. EST), Waxahachie city spokeswoman Amy Hollywood said initial tests did not indicate any danger to those in the area. That assessment was later confirmed by EPA official Nicolas Brescia. ""We have not seen any significant level that would cause a public health concern,"" Brescia told reporters. Brescia said that tests conducted from flights over and around the fire detected small amounts of two chemicals, but nothing that would be considered dangerous to anyone outside the immediate vicinity of the fire. A statement from his federal agency also indicated that ""ground-level portable sampling devices did not show elevated toxic chemicals."" Earlier, Dave Bary -- a Dallas-based spokesman for the EPA -- said the most prevalent chemical that the company had documented, and produced on site, was anhydrous ammonia. The EPA official said earlier Monday that 48,630 pounds of the chemical, which creates a toxic vapor downwind when released, have been reported at the site. It was not known how much of the chemical was released into the air during the fire. Officials ordered the evacuation of a school, an apartment building and other industrial sites within an eight-block radius of the plant, said Diana Buckley, an official with Ellis County government. A shelter-in-place advisory is in effect for some smaller nearby towns northwest of the city, including Red Oak, she said. ""Everybody is out and safe,"" Donald Golden, environmental health and safety manager for Magnablend Inc., the plant's owner, said of employees and visitors to the plant. The plant stores and mixes numerous chemicals, said Amy Hollywood, a city spokeswoman. Images transmitted by CNN affiliates KTVT and WFAA showed orange flames devouring buildings and licking at tanker cars parked at the edge of the Magnablend plant, which is about 30 miles south of Dallas. Firefighters had pulled back and were using ladder trucks to spray water on the fire, Hollywood said. Multiple fire departments were on the scene. One of the them, the Midlothian Fire Department, reported that chemicals had been released in the fire, but no additional details were immediately available. Officials have said burning liquid continued to fuel the flames hours after it began, but they appeared able to wrestle the fire under control by early Monday evening. There was no immediate word on the cause on the fire, Golden said. No one was injured in the fire, Hudgins said. The nearby Wedgeworth Elementary School was evacuated, a school district official confirmed. Students were being taken to a school across town, school officials said. Navarro College's Waxahachie campus also evacuated, a receptionist confirmed. Southwestern Assemblies of God University, which is on the other side of town from the chemical plant, was keeping people inside but had not evacuated, spokeswoman Christina Freeze said. Magnablend produces custom chemicals for a variety of industries, including oil, agriculture, pet and animal feed, water treatment, construction and industrial cleaning companies, according to its website. Anhydrous ammonia is a clear, colorless gas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can be absorbed into the body by inhalation, ingestion, eye contact and skin contact.

1680,"(CNN) -- The FBI was investigating after a dead newborn baby was found onboard a Carnival cruise ship, authorities said Sunday. The baby was found by a Carnival Dream crew member Wednesday morning in a guest cabin, said Special Agent Dave Couvertier, spokesman for the FBI field office in Tampa, Florida. Carnival personnel reported the discovery to Dutch authorities on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten, where the ship was docked. Dutch authorities took custody of the infant's body and interviewed the 20-year-old mother, an American passenger, Couvertier said in an e-mail. The FBI was coordinating with Carnival Cruise Lines, he said, adding the company has been ""fully cooperative."" The FBI's Evidence Response team was activated Saturday when the ship returned to Port Canaveral, Florida, he said. Agents processed and searched two guest cabins and interviewed crew members and passengers. ""Due to the international and jurisdictional aspects involved with this incident, we are still working on obtaining facts and specific details,"" Couvertier said. ""No one has been charged as we are still working on obtaining facts and gathering any available evidence. As a result, no information has been released regarding any suspect at this time."" The baby's mother remained in St. Maarten and is expected to return to the United States within the next 24 hours, Couvertier said Sunday.

Ross was taken to a Florida hospital after he suffered an unidentified medical emergency on a Delta flight to Memphis a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN. A Broward County Sheriff's Office fire rescue team met Delta Flight 1310 at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, said the source, who was not authorized to speak to the media. ""Ross was breathing and conscious and alert when we reached the passenger on the plane,"" said the source. ""He was conscious on transport. He was assessed and transported to Broward General Medical Center."" The rapper later wrote on his Twitter account that he was headed to Memphis and posted a video with him on a plane, getting ready to take off.

1682,"(CNN) -- Heavy rain that has killed at least 60 people in Central America is not expected to let up soon, authorities said Monday. El Salvador is the country hit hardest so far. The government has declared a state of emergency and ordered evacuations. At least 32 people have died in El Salvador, including several children, according to the country's civil protection director. Some were swept away attempting to cross swollen rivers, while others were killed when the walls of their homes collapsed. ""The temporary evacuation of the population in some parts of the country is meant to avoid casualties caused by mudslides,"" said Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes, who also ordered the cancellation of school classes. In Guatemala, the death toll stands at 28 and close to 110,000 people have been affected by the rain. President Alvaro Colom said that 15,000 more people are at risk and roughly 12,000 are in shelters, according to a statement on his website. ""We're praying to God for help,"" said Celida Yesenia Lopez, a Guatemalan flood survivor who lost her home. ""It's very sad."" Honduras was similarly struck. The majority of the country's 18 departments are under alert and some 13,000 people have been affected. Central America has been hammered by torrential rain since last week. Jova struck Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane late Tuesday. It weakened into a tropical storm and then a tropical depression as it moved over western Mexico. At the same time, Tropical Depression 12-E, which never reached tropical storm strength, brought the heavy rain to El Salvador and its neighbors. More rain is forecast in the region.","Evacuations are in effect in El Salvador, where 32 people are dead .

1683,"Cancun, Mexico (CNN) -- The storm known as Rina fizzled Friday as it moved over the Yucatan Channel, the strait between Mexico and Cuba, the National Hurricane Center said. No coastal watches or warnings were in effect after Rina lost much of its punch. The storm had diminished in strength from a Category 2 hurricane that raised fears in and around some of the most popular resort communities in Mexico. It was classified as a remnant low Friday afternoon, with maximum sustained winds of 30 miles an hour, the hurricane center said. Rina's eye was about 75 miles west of the western tip of Cuba and 110 miles north-northeast of Cozumel, moving east-northeast at 5 mph. ""A turn toward the southeast is expected on Saturday, with a turn toward the south expected on Sunday,"" the hurricane center said in what was its last public advisory on the system. Continued weakening is forecast for the next two days. Rina had been expected to drop between 3 to 6 inches of rain over the eastern part of the Yucatan Peninsula and Cozumel through Friday, with isolated amounts of up to 10 inches, according to the Miami-based weather agency. A storm surge of as much as 1 to 2 feet above normal tide levels along the coast was also expected, ""accompanied by large and dangerous waves,"" forecasters had said. Authorities took precautionary measures ahead of the storm, while numerous businesses in Cancun and elsewhere shut down. ""First we're thinking, we're stranded in Cancun; there could be worse things,"" said Amelie Jarvis, a tourist from Canada. ""But then we noticed that everything is closed. I don't know what we're going to do."" CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: Rina weakens to a remnant low .

1684,"(CNN) -- Thai authorities on Monday moved to ease fears that the devastating floods that have engulfed much of the country will swamp the capital. The country's Flood Relief Operation Command (FROC) reported that flood defense measures in low-lying Bangkok have held and that the bloated Chao Praya River has not risen any further. There had been fears that further heavy rain over the weekend combined with the spring high tides would overwhelm parts of the city. ""The water situation in Bangkok city is no longer a worry and today is the end of the high tide period,"" FROC spokesperson Wim Rungwattanachinda told CNN. However, Irrigation department director general Chalit Damrongsak warned the situation remained critical as water from low-lying areas north of Bangkok still needed to drain. ""It is not over,"" he said, in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse. So far, 307 people have been killed during months of monsoon rains across Thailand, with more than 8.6 million in 61 provinces affected by the rising floodwater. Asia's wet and wild summer explained . More than 500,000 square kilometers -- an area the size of Spain -- have been affected by the floods in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, according to CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. In the ancient city of Ayutthara, one of the worst-hit areas, officials said the floodwater was starting to recede and flow towards the rivers. The temples and monuments in the UNESCO-listed historical city have been submerged for days, prompting concern that much of the water damage will be permanent. Meanwhile, a massive effort is underway to protect the Navanakorn Industrial Park to the north of Bangkok. The giant complex -- one of Thailand's largest -- houses a number of companies that produce electronics and components for the automotive industry. According to the Bangkok Post, 600 workers, civilian volunteers and soldiers were working around the clock Sunday to strengthen defense walls on all sides of the facility as the water continued to rise. Other manufacturing sites north of Bangkok, such as Rojana Industrial Park, were forced to halt operations as the floodwater hit. Honda last week said the closure of its plant there affected the production of at least 4,500 cars. The Thai finance ministry says overall damage from the floods could be more than $2 billion, with the worst yet still possibly to come,"" according to CNN's Paula Hancocks. Floods are an annual occurrence in the country but it has been particularly acute this year. Thais across the country are donating food, water and clothing to help the worst-hit areas. Authorities said donations have far surpassed previous years. The government said that it has received $2.07 million in donations, including help from other countries, by Sunday. The United States said it is sending 26 helicopters to help the relief effort, invaluable as more roads turn to rivers and become impassable. United Nations agencies also are on standby, while the World Health Organization has offered emergency health kits.

1685,"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Washi moved away from the southern Philippines early Monday, but not before leaving behind a wake of destruction and at least 652 people dead, according to the Philippine Red Cross. There were no public storm warnings for the East Asian island nation Monday morning, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. Yet authorities and residents still had the considerable task of cleaning up from the devastation and mourning those killed by what the state-run Philippines News Agency noted was the 19th tropical system to hit the nation this season. A report released Monday morning by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council noted that the storm had affected more than 135,000 people, nearly 47,000 of whom were in evacuation centers. President Beningo Aquino plans to visit the region Tuesday. The Red Cross noted that hundreds are missing after entire villages were swept away, suggesting the death toll could rise further. The stench of death permeated the air as aid workers scrambled to help survivors. The disaster has left heartbreaking scenes of families with children looking for ways to get by during the festive Christmas season. ""Do we still have Christmas, mother?"" one crying little girl asked her mother, according to the Red Cross. ""Will I get my toys and my new pair of shoes you promised?"" ""Of course you will,"" the mother replied. ""Christmas will always be around."" Military and disaster officials said the vast majority of the dead were found in the port cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro, many of them swept away as they were sleeping. Water-logged bodies from washed-away villages floated at the shoreline, on the northwestern coast of Mindanao island. Five people were killed in a landslide, but virtually all the others died in flash flooding after Tropical Storm Washi, which is called Sendong locally. Survivors in the hardest-hit areas are contending with no electricity or clean drinking water. One woman in Cagayan de Oro collected murky brown floodwater in a bucket, just meters away from where a destroyed vehicle was submerged. Flash flooding overnight Friday -- following 10 hours of rain -- fueled the devastation. As much as 20 centimeters (8 inches) of rain fell within 24 hours in some areas. December generally brings about 60 millimeters of rain (a little over 2 inches) to the region, CNN Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri reported. Overflowing rivers and tributaries compounded the disaster for low-lying areas, and officials said floodwater reached roof-level in the middle of the night. The destruction left cars, furniture and parts of houses in mangled heaps, partly immersed in squalid floodwater. The storm moved into Cagayan de Oro -- a densely populated, urbanized city -- during the overnight hours when people were asleep. A half dozen vehicles there looked like littered toy trucks, with some on their sides or roofs. Many people trudged through knee-high water and packed into evacuation centers. An estimated 100,000 people are displaced, according to the Department of Social Welfare and Development. The national disaster council noted that about 377 passengers -- on four ships -- were stranded as of Sunday night, due to the storm. In addition, nine sections of roads and bridges were seriously damaged. While the tropical storm had passed off-shore, some unrelated thunderstorms threatened to dump even more water on the region, Javaheri said. The weather was warm, with temperatures of up to about 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit), . Philippine Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon will travel to the stricken region Monday to assess the damage, the organization said. ""Certainly this is a very severe humanitarian crisis going on,"" Gordon said Sunday. Authorities have started distributing food rations for some 10,000 families affected by the storm, while also handing out thousands of blankets and mosquito nets, the Red Cross said. The aid agency is appealing for drinking water, food and dry clothes, and officials have asked for volunteers to pack food to send to those who have been displaced. Some Philippine residents called the disaster unprecedented. Benito Ramos, chairman of the national disaster council, said he thinks the event was influenced by climate change and deforestation. Ramos said the storm moved in a westward path to areas rarely hit by major storms or flooding. The most devastated cities -- Cagayan de Oro and Iligan -- became catch basins for water flowing from highlands with denuded forests. Floodwater from Bukidnon province poured down into Cagayan de Oro, while water from Lanao del Sur province gushed into Iligan.

1686,"(CNN) -- Instead of presents, there might be IOUs under some Christmas trees in Colorado on Sunday. This week's snow storm has delayed the delivery of some 50,000 UPS packages into the Denver area, CNN affiliate KUSA reported, citing a company spokeswoman. ""We know it's Christmas. We apologize for the delay, but we can't control the weather,"" Natalie Godwin said. ""As soon as we can, we're going to get all of those packages delivered."" Hundreds of people waited in line Saturday outside of the UPS building in Commerce City, hoping to pick up their packages, KUSA said. A winter weather system blasted broad swaths of the West and Midwest this week, dumping heavy snow. ""This makes no sense. They get paid. It snows in Colorado. That's what it does here. So how are you in the business that you can't deliver what you say?"" Jacqueline Camack, a frustrated customer, told KUSA. UPS has said it planned to make more than 120 million deliveries this week, its busiest of the year.","A company spokeswoman apologizes for the delay .

1687,"Bangkok (CNN) -- Much of Southeast Asia continued its recovery from heavy rains and extensive flooding Friday, including scores of deaths and extensive damage in Thailand. The wet weather is not entirely abnormal in the region, which is still in the midst of its wet season. Still, the extent of destruction has been particularly devastating in some locales in recent weeks. Thai authorities early Friday said that the flooding had left at least 244 people dead, and some 28 provinces have been affected. More than 820,000 households have been affected in four of the hardest-hit provinces -- Ayutthaya, Lop Buri, Chai Nat and Nakhon -- the state-run MCOT news agency reported, quoting the national disaster prevention and mitigation ministry. An official Thai industrial agency urged factories in Ayutthaya province to shut down through October 11 in order to give it more time to tackle pervasive flooding. The same MCOT report described the situation at the Rojana Industrial Park, in particular, as ""critical."" A government industrial ministry said water will continue to rise over a flood prevention dike, causing issues in the park which has 198 factories that employ 90,000 people. Nationwide, Thai's Labor ministry reported Friday that 1,215 factories in 33 provinces were underwater -- a disaster that affected about 41,000 workers. Almost half of those workers were in Ayutthaya. Moreover, a corrections department official told MCOT that 3,700 inmates in that province had to be evacuated after their prison was submerged under 1.7 meters (6 feet) of water. Filipinos, meanwhile, are trying to regain their footing after being pummeled by successive typhoons in the span of a week. Typhoon Nesat -- known locally as Pedring -- claimed 55 lives, and the death toll from Nalgae -- known locally as Quiel -- rose to four earlier this week. Health and government officials were working fervently to prevent more deaths Friday as they provided medical treatment for people from flood-stricken areas. Health Secretary Enrique Ona said that 54 medical teams from hospitals in and around Manila have gone to evacuation centers in Bulacan and Pampanga to treat the ill, the state-run Philippine News Agency reported. About 3,600 patients in evacuation centers had respiratory diseases, such as the flu and pneumonia, while there were about 600 diarrhea cases, said Ona. In addition, five in Bulacan had leptospirosis, a bacterial disease. Nearby countries were also dealing with the aftermath of severe flooding. That includes Laos, where the top official in Savannakhet province requested ""large amounts of government funding"" in 12 of 15 districts, money that could be used to repair irrigation systems and develop anti-flood systems, according to the state-run KPL news agency. And in Cambodia, Agriculture minister H.E. Chan Saran said that flooding there had affected more than 330,000 hectares (815,000 acres) of rice fields and killed 1,000 working animals in 103 of the nation's 145 districts, the official AKP agency reported Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton offered her nation's ""deepest condolences"" for the families of those who died in Southeast Asia due to the heavy rains and flooding. ""Our embassies in the region are working with local authorities and international organizations to assess how the United States can be of help to countries where the impact of the flooding has been especially devastating,"" Clinton said in a statement. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Flooding in Thailand leaves at least 244 dead and 1,215 factories submerged .

1688,"(CNN) -- Worries about high tides overwhelming parts of Thailand in recent days have morphed into fears about water- and insect-borne diseases in the flood-ravaged country. Bangkok's central business district has avoided major flooding so far, but outlying areas are chest- or waist-deep in water. ""The water in those parts is a filthy black color containing sewage, garbage and dead animals with a nasty smell. Mosquitoes are also breeding rapidly,"" said Igor Prahin of Bangkok. More than 370 people have died since the flooding began after heavy monsoon rains. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Kristie A. Kenney said Monday that ""the worst may be over for central Bangkok,"" but about 2 million people are still affected by the flooding. The United States has pledged a total of $1.1 million in aid. CNNGo: Updated travel information for tourists . Charities working in the country have warned of diseases such as diarrhea, dengue fever and malaria in the coming days and weeks. ""There are places on the outskirts of Bangkok and in other parts of the country which have been flooded for nearly two weeks,"" said Matthew Cochrane of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""The country's prime minister has said that the city has 'dodged a bullet' -- the economic impact of central Bangkok being flooded would have been huge, and thankfully that did not happen -- but a huge part of the country is still under water,"" Cochrane said. ""Outside the city it is certainly a humanitarian crisis, because there are people who have been cut off for weeks without any aid, supplies or food."" UNICEF said it was providing 20,000 mosquito nets and handing out 20,000 pamphlets explaining how to stay safe and healthy in flood-stricken regions. Supatra (Jenstitvong) Assavasuke, who lives east of central Bangkok, took in two friends whose house on the west side of the city is submerged under 1 to 2 meters (3 to 7 feet) of water. It's unclear how long they will need to stay. She and her family have helped donate about 3,000 liters (almost 800 gallons) of drinking water to those in worse-off areas. ""Those who got affected, they lose their houses, they lose their jobs, their cars -- many things,"" she said. But even those in the capital faced possible shortages of water. The Metropolitan Waterworks Authority said it had reduced the amount of tap water processed for residents from 900,000 to 400,000 cubic meters per day, because of high algae counts at one of its plants. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said authorities would speed up the process of draining water into Bangkok's canals and into the sea, raising hopes that water levels in the city could start to sink. However, the government has warned it may take more than a month for the floods to recede. Already, the flooding has caused an estimated $6 billion in damages, the Thai Finance Ministry has said. The Thai government has set up more than 1,700 shelters across the country, where more than 113,000 people have taken refuge. Yet many are trying to push through with their daily routines. In Bangkok's Chinatown area, a food vendor up to her knees in murky water continued to serve patrons at her small cart. One resident traveled down a street by row boat as a nearby bicyclist pedaled through thigh-deep flooding. And a man walked his dog near Bangkok's Grand Palace, the dog chest-deep in water. CNN's Bryony Jones, Kocha Olarn and Germain Perez contributed to this report.","2 million people are affected by the flooding, a U.S. diplomat to Thailand says .

1691,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria imposed a 24-hour curfew Saturday in the northern city of Kano after assailants killed scores of people and wounded others in a hail of gunfire and coordinated bombings of eight government sites. A military official told CNN that at least 156 people were dead and feared the number would rise. ""The hospitals are not equipped to deal with the influx and severity of the injuries, so we are expecting that figure to go up further,"" the official said. Nwankpa Nwankpa, a Red Cross information officer in the capital, Abuja, said 50 people were injured in the attacks. He said that search and rescue operations are underway and volunteers are working to assist those hurt. The attacks targeted several police stations, barracks and the building housing the assistant inspector general of police in Kano, Nigeria's second largest city. A passport office, state security headquarters and the immigration office were also hit, police said. Are you there? Share your story . Terrified residents barricaded themselves in their homes, said Rev. Murtala Mati of the Christian Association of Nigeria. ""The government is really trying but we are afraid ... we are all scared,"" he said. During the attack, assailants entered a police station, freed detainees and bombed it, authorities said. They later canvassed the area in a car led by motorcycles, spraying targets with gunfire. Islamist group Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the blast in a phone call to the Daily Trust, according to journalists at the newspaper. Nigeria closed its borders Saturday with Cameroon and Niger, whom it has accused of allowing the militants to move freely into Nigeria. The government has put in place a state of emergency, and a large deployment of troops has been sent to the north of the country. African Union commission chairman Jean Ping condemned ""in the strongest terms"" the attacks Saturday, and expressed his condolences to the families of those killed and his concern for the many people who were injured. The AU rejects terrorism in all its forms, the statement said, and gives Nigeria its full backing in its efforts to end terror attacks. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is ""appalled at the frequency and intensity of recent attacks in Nigeria, which demonstrate a wanton and unacceptable disregard for human life,"" his office said Saturday in a statement. ""In voicing solidarity with the government and people of Nigeria, the secretary-general also expresses his hope for swift and transparent investigations into these incidents that lead to bringing the perpetrators to justice,"" the statement added. In December, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in four northern states. The declaration followed a series of Christmas Day attacks on Christian churches blamed on the Boko Haram group. The man suspected of masterminding those attacks, named Kabiru Sokoto, was briefly captured this week before escaping police custody while being transferred to another prison. Several police officers and the local commissioner are under investigation over his escape. A 50 million naira ($307,000) reward was also offered by police Thursday for any information leading to Sokoto's re-arrest. Northern Nigeria has been wracked by religious violence in recent weeks, including a spate of attacks in early January that killed at least 25 Christians. Boko Haram has been blamed for months of widespread bloodshed, with churches and police stations among the targets.

1693,"(CNN) -- A freak fall snow storm slammed the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Saturday, leaving three people dead, more than 2 million households without power and thousands of air travelers stranded. An 84-year-old man was napping in a recliner at his home in Temple, Pennsylvania, on Saturday afternoon when part of a large, snow-filled tree fell into his house and killed him ""instantly,"" according to a state police report. With numerous downed trees in the area, rescue crews took two hours to ""safely remove the victim."" Another person died while driving in Hebron, Connecticut, state emergency spokesman Scott Devico said. A third person was killed in Springfield, Massachusetts, when a man in his 20s ignored police barricades surrounding downed power lines and touched a metal guard rail, which was charged, said city fire department spokesman Dennis Legere. Predicting the system could dump as much as 18 inches of snow in some spots, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy joined New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick in issuing emergency declarations for their respective states. ""It's like a blizzard, you can't see far at all,"" CNN iReporter Alban Ajro, 32, said Saturday night from Watertown, Connecticut. ""This is the first time that I can ever recall this kind of storm happening before Halloween."" All domestic flights out of New Jersey's Newark International Airport were canceled around 4 p.m. Saturday, according to an announcement made at the airport. Frustrated passengers filled an array of long lines, trying to change their tickets in light of the storm. Overheard: Storm sparks discussion about new grid . Another airport in the Garden State, Teterboro, closed just after 2 p.m. before reopening hours later, the Federal Aviation Administration reported on its website. The FAA also reported major delays of, at times, over 5 hours at New York's two airports, John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia. Richard Roth, a CNN correspondent, was among those affected when his Syracuse-to-Kennedy flight was diverted to Hartford because of the storm. He sat with his fellow passengers on the runway at Bradley International Airport for about four and a half hours, and -- roughly eight hours after arriving -- he was still stuck in the terminal. ""We're here in the dark now,"" Roth said Saturday evening. ""There's no hope, at the moment, in sight."" The Connecticut governor acknowledged that conditions ""are not very pleasant"" at Bradley, where 23 flights have been diverted. He added, ""They're trying to get people off their planes as rapidly as they can."" The early season snowstorm was the result of unseasonably cold air mixing with a storm system on the East Coast. iReport: Winter weather near you . As of 8 p.m., the storm had already dumped 10 inches of snow in places as far afield as Ridgefield, Connecticut; Ogletown, Pennsylvania; and Terra Alta, West Virginia, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of New York and New Jersey especially got buried, including 15.5 inches in West Milford, New Jersey, and 12 inches in Harriman, New York. Lesser, albeit still significant amounts were measured in other locales around the northeast, including 1.3 inches of snow in New York's Central Park as of 8 p.m. -- the most ever for this date since record-keeping began in 1869. Snow continued to fall Saturday night as the system moved over New England. The storm's timing made it unique and caught some off-guard. ""We're used to a lot of snow here, but not this early,"" CNN iReporter Michael Majosky, 34, said from Windber, Pennsylvania. ""We don't mind the snow -- it's pretty neat having it around Halloween."" Winter storm warnings were in effect Saturday evening for a swath of states, from Pennsylvania to eastern Maine. Along with heavy snow, high winds gusting up to 50 mph were possible. Forecasters' predictions of power outages and downed trees in some areas bore fruit, as hundreds of thousands were without electricity as of Saturday afternoon. The reason is that the moisture content -- thus density -- of the falling snow was particularly high given temperatures hovering around the freezing point. 'Occupy' demonstrators face bite of wintry storm . Malloy, the Connecticut governor, said early Saturday night that 50,000 to 70,000 customers were losing power every hour, with the leading utility Connecticut Light and Power reporting on its website about 550,000 without service at 9 p.m. Saturday. The governor cautioned that power crews are not out on the roads, and won't return until road conditions improve markedly. ""If you are without power, you should expect to be without power for a prolonged period of time,"" Malloy said. About 715,000 customers were without power late Saturday in New Jersey, in addition to 333,000 in neighboring New York, according to figures reported Saturday evening by power companies in those states. Another 360,000 didn't have electricity in Pennsylvania due to the storm. Other states were affected as well, including at least 7,000 households in Maryland, 6,300 in Virginia who get service from Dominion, and 1,400 Allegheny Power customers in West Virginia. The storm had wreaked havoc on the roads, with Malloy noting ""a large number of spin-outs and vehicles going off the road"" in his state. He noted that -- in addition to the fatality -- a state trooper was injured in a crash. And in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers warned that the wet snow would turn to ice in many spots overnight due to freezing temperatures, making road conditions even more perilous. One positive is that the wintry weather shouldn't last too much longer. By Sunday afternoon, the storm is expected to have passed the United States. Temperatures should warm by then -- including a high of 49 forecast for Sunday in New York, warming into the high-50s over the course of the week.

1694,"(CNN) -- Two people died and 13 others were injured in four separate shootings in New Orleans early Tuesday, including one on Bourbon Street where costumed revelers were celebrating Halloween. The first shooting, just after midnight outside a Bourbon Street nightclub, sent people running for cover, CNN affiliate WWL reported. A 25-year-old man was shot several times and died at a hospital, police said. Seven other people, ranging in age from 19 to 50, were also injured. ""Apparently one or two people were shooting or shooting at each other for reasons unknown when eight people were struck by the gunfire,"" New Orleans police said in a statement. The injuries to those wounded in that incident appeared to be non-life-threatening, authorities said. Police were still searching for a suspect or suspects Tuesday. Video from the scene showed evidence markers lying next to Mardi Gras beads on the street and the area cordoned off with crime scene tape as music continued to spill from nearby Bourbon Street bars. ""I've never seen so many people on Bourbon Street scatter to the sides,"" one woman, who was not identified, told WWL. ""I've never seen that in my life."" She said she saw the shooting, but was ""traumatized"" and unable to run. ""I was so scared,"" she said. A second shooting took place about 1:45 a.m. on Canal Street, police said. A 19-year-old man was killed and three other people injured. Officers heard gunshots while on patrol and saw three males running from the scene, police spokesman Garry Flot said in a statement. After a foot pursuit, two men were apprehended. One of the men was questioned and released, but a 24-year-old faces charges of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted first-degree murder, police said. Two other shootings took place in different locations later in the morning, Flot said, and a total of three people were injured. WWL said the two other shootings took place about 4 and 5:30 a.m. CNN's Karan Olson Meilhan, Scott Thompson and Samuel Gardner III contributed to this report.","NEW: A total of four separate shootings took place overnight .

1695,"(CNN) -- Joseph Maraachli, the infant who became the center of an international end-of-life debate, died peacefully in his sleep at his Windsor, Ontario, home, a spokesperson for the family said Wednesday. Widely known in the media as ""Baby Joseph,"" the 20-month-old boy spent the last several months with his family and died Tuesday afternoon. ""Obviously, it's been a very difficult day for the family today,"" said spokeswoman Emma Fedor. ""In some ways, it was a bit of a relief for the family."" Joseph's family had refused to accept a recommendation by a Canadian hospital to remove the boy's breathing tube and allow him to die. In March, the infant received a tracheotomy at a children's hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. He was able to go home April 21. ""By providing him with this common palliative procedure, we've given Joseph the chance to go home and be with his family after spending so much of his young life in the hospital,"" said Dr. Robert Wilmott, chief of pediatrics for SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center in St. Louis. A London, Ontario, hospital where Joseph was receiving care for a progressive neurological disease refused to perform a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the airway through an incision in the neck to allow for suction of fluid out of the lungs. In court papers, doctors in Canada said there was no hope for recovery. They would not perform a tracheotomy because they considered it to be invasive and not recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine. Parents Moe and Sana Maraachli refused to accept the recommendation. The Maraachlis' daughter, Zeina, had died at home in 2002 after a tracheotomy after suffering similar complications, and the family wanted to offer the same care to their son. ""To go through it once is enough for a lifetime, to go through it twice, it's just ... unbelievable,"" Fedor said. Joseph was ""very peaceful, in no pain whatsoever, no distress,"" when he died, Fedor said. He was buried Wednesday next to his sister. The family was thankful for those who helped and prayed for Joseph, she added. ""The heart of the issue would come down to the mix between respecting the parents' rights ... to be in comfort of (their) own home, to die on God's time,"" said Fedor. The family countered assertions that Joseph was nonresponsive, blind and deaf, she said. Instead, the boy could hear the parents' voices and look for them, Fedor told CNN. The family believed that, after a tracheotomy, Joseph could be freed from machinery. The parents said that they, rather than physicians, should make a judgment on quality of life, Fedor said. The Maraachli case caught the attention of the group Priests for Life, which funded Joseph's transfer and treatment at the SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center. That hospital deemed the procedure medically appropriate and Baby Joseph underwent a tracheotomy there on March 21. In April, Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said he considered this a ""victory over the culture of death."" He says ""(Joseph) has gained benefit from his tracheotomy, is breathing on his own, and is going home to live with his parents."" Priests for Life is a Catholic pro-life organization that functions as a network to prevent abortion and euthanasia. The group often is noted for the graphic images depicting abortion its members and supporters use to make their case. The London Health Sciences Centre -- the hospital where Joseph was initially treated -- in March said that ""there are clearly differences in the approach of these centres to the management of end-of-life care in this tragic situation"" and that ""the medical judgments made by LHSC physicians remain unchallenged by any credible medical source."" Nurses helped the family provide 24-hour care for Joseph in his final months. ""There was always somebody by his side,"" Fedor said. The child was on almost no medication and apparently was in no pain, Fedor said. ""When he was in the arms of his parents, you could tell,"" she said. ""He was settled when he was in their arms.""","Joseph Maraachli suffered from a progressive neurological disease .

1696,"(CNN) -- Formula One's big-name drivers have spoken of their desire to put on a sporting spectacle which Japan's motorsport fans can enjoy, as the country continues to recover from their devastating earthquake earlier this year. Japan was hit by a catastrophic quake and tsunami in March which left 27,000 people dead or missing, and F1's drivers have been telling of their continued support for the nation ahead of Sunday's race at Suzuka. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel will seal a second consecutive world championship if he finishes higher than 10th in the race and the German expressed his admiration for the Japanese people. ""The fans in Japan are special,"" Vettel, who has won the last two grands prix in Japan, told Formula One's official website. ""What they have been through in recent times is something I cannot begin to imagine, but they are so impressive. F1 title race: Vettel on the brink . ""They are extremely patient and always polite and friendly and their stamina is amazing. I hope we can put on a good show for them this weekend."" McLaren's Jenson Button is the only other driver who can still mathematically overhaul Vettel and the 2009 title winner spoke of his fondness for Japan, saying the Asian country is a home away from home. ""I consider Japan my second home,"" Button, 31, said. ""It's a place that's very close to my heart, and, obviously, it's going to be a very emotional experience for me to be racing in Japan for the first time since the events of last March. ""I'm very proud that the Formula One world championship will put Japan on the world's sporting stage this weekend: while the country is still collectively rebuilding itself. ""I hope we can put on a great race to bring further strength to the people of Japan. And to everyone in Japan, I say: 'Ganbatte! [Japanese for good luck]'"" Button's fellow-Briton and teammate Lewis Hamilton, a world champion in 2008, praised the Suzuka circuit and described it as one of his favorite Formula One destinations. ""The Japanese Grand Prix is one of the highlights of my season,"" Hamilton, 26, said. ""I think Suzuka will play to my strengths: it's a track that really requires you to drive in an attacking way to be able to get a good lap time. ""It's an uncompromising place. But that's when the thrill of driving a Formula One car is at its highest."" Kamui Kobayashi will be the sole Japanese racer on the grid this weekend, with the Sauber driver excited by the prospect of competing in front of his home crowd. ""I am very proud of Suzuka as this is one of the really great circuits,"" the 25-year-old said. ""It is always really enjoyable to drive here as well. Racing here is always great and really thanks to the many fans as they are always waiting for Formula One.""","F1's drivers have expressed their support for Japan in the wake of March quake .

1697,"State College, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Penn State students and alumni held a candlelight vigil late Sunday to honor and remember Joe Paterno, the iconic former football coach. Paterno, 85, died Sunday at a State College, Pennsylvania, hospital, according to his family. He had been suffering from lung cancer and had recently broken his pelvis. ""It is with great sadness that we announce that Joe Paterno passed away earlier today,"" said the statement. ""His loss leaves a void in our lives that will never be filled."" Students braved freezing temperatures to attend the vigil on the lawn of the Old Main building on Penn State's campus. They held candles, locked arms, and sung the school's alma mater to say goodbye. Later, they walked over to a statue of Paterno outside Beaver Stadium, which has become a sort of makeshift memorial. ""He's more than a coach; his family's more than a family,"" said Bethanna Edmiston, a local resident and alumna who met her husband at Penn State. ""It's extremely difficult for the whole Nittany nation,"" she said. ""Unless you're part of Penn State, you just don't understand what it means."" Share your thoughts on Paterno's death . Earlier on Sunday, many fans were seen crying as they stood at the statue. It features Paterno with his index finger outstretched in the ""No. 1"" gesture. A quote from Paterno, who spent 61 years at Penn State, is on the wall behind the statue. ""They ask me what I'd like written about me when I'm gone,"" the quote says. ""I hope they write I made Penn State a better place, not just that I was a good football coach."" Edmiston said she moved to State College at age 8, as Paterno took the reins at Penn State. ""Our family thanks Penn Staters, students & all people for prayers & support for my Dad,"" Paterno's son, Jay Paterno, tweeted Sunday, ""He felt your support in his fight."" Family statement: ""He fought hard until the end"" The gathering at the statue has been ongoing since Saturday night, after a family spokesman said Paterno's condition had worsened. Some shoveled snow so others could walk up and touch Paterno's outstretched hand on his statue. Signs, flowers and candles surrounded the statue, along with photographs of Paterno. ""You're our hero,"" one said. Another one, flanked by candles, simply said: ""Coach."" Jay Paterno tweeted Saturday night that he drove by the statue, and that the love and support inspired his father. ""He died as he lived,"" the family statement said. ""He fought hard until the end, stayed positive, thought only of others and constantly reminded everyone of how blessed his life had been."" Media falsely report Paterno's death . Several websites that reported Saturday night that Paterno had died later apologized for the error, including the Penn State student news website Onward State, the first to report the erroneous information. Paterno was fired in November amid outrage over the handling of accusations against former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who faces more than 50 counts involving sexual acts with 10 boys since 1994. Sandusky has pleaded not guilty. But several of those gathered at the statue Sunday remembered Paterno as a unifying presence both at the university and in State College. ""I want everyone in our whole country to know that Joe united us,"" said Diane Farley, a Penn State alumna and current university employee. ""And I don't want anyone to point fingers at anyone anymore, and I want them to know that State College is a place that cares, because Joe cared, and there's just been a lot of confusion in the past six weeks ... We're all on this Earth together. We're all going to go out eventually, like Joe, and we need to be a little bit more loving and caring with each other."" ""They're just ordinary people,"" Edmiston said of the Paterno family. ""They lived in the same house since they moved there, not a fancy house, just everyday people. They gave everything they had to Penn State -- not only money, but their time, their efforts. It's just an amazing legacy that he's left behind."" Another man said he doesn't believe the scandal will tarnish Paterno's memory. ""It won't define him,"" said the man, who did not give his name. ""It wasn't who he was."" The family previously said Paterno had a treatable form of cancer. In December, he was admitted to a hospital after fracturing his pelvis when he slipped and fell at his home in State College. Under Paterno's 46-year leadership, the Nittany Lions won two national championships, went undefeated five times and finished in the top 25 national rankings 35 times, according to his official Penn State biography. Sports Illustrated: Paterno's legacy was more than the final chapter . At the time of Paterno's dismissal, Vice Chairman of Trustees John P. Surma said he hoped the school's 95,000 students and hundreds of thousands of alumni would believe the decision ""is in the best long-term interest of the university, which is much larger than athletic programs."" Paterno told the Washington Post this month he felt inadequate to deal with the initial allegation of abuse against Sandusky. ""I didn't know exactly how to handle it and I was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was,"" Paterno told the Post. ""So I backed away and turned it over to some other people, people I thought would have a little more expertise than I did. It didn't work out that way."" The former coach spoke with a raspy voice during the interview -- Paterno's first extensive comments since being fired. A Penn State graduate assistant, Mike McQueary, told the grand jury late last year that he had seen Sandusky ""with a boy in the shower and that it was severe sexual acts going on and that it was wrong and over the line."" He said he had gone to Paterno with what he saw. Paterno said he'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report, but that he nevertheless reported the allegations to his boss, then-Athletic Director Tim Curley. Curley and Gary Schultz, a former university vice president, have been charged with perjury and failure to report the abuse allegations, which law enforcement did not learn about for several years. They have pleaded not guilty. ""You know, he didn't want to get specific,"" Paterno said about McQueary. ""And to be frank with you I don't know that it would have done any good, because I never heard of, of, rape and a man. So I just did what I thought was best. I talked to people that I thought would be, if there was a problem, that would be following up on it,"" he told The Washington Post. ""I called my superiors and I said, 'Hey, we got a problem, I think. Would you guys look into it?' Because I didn't know, you know ... I had never had to deal with something like that. And I didn't feel adequate,"" Paterno said. ""Joe was Penn State,"" Edmiston said. ""He made Penn State. And it's really a very sad, sad day for all of us.""

1698,"(CNN) -- A small plane headed from New Jersey to suburban Atlanta crashed onto an interstate shortly after takeoff Tuesday, killing five people, authorities said. Two men, one woman, two children and a dog aboard the plane died in the crash in Morristown, New Jersey, just after 10 a.m. ET, said Robert Gretz, a senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. The plane, a six-seater Socata TBM700, was headed from Teterboro, New Jersey, to DeKalb-Peachtree Airport in suburban Atlanta when it crashed onto Interstate 287 about 14 minutes into the flight, Gretz said. The plane was at about 17,500 feet when ""there was some discussion between the pilot and the controller of locations of icing conditions,"" he said. He told reporters Monday night the conversation seemed ""routine"" and was ""not a distress call."" Gretz said he did not know whether the conversation concerned a cloud that might contain ice; actual icing on the airplane; or whether the pilot was inquiring where ice might be or reporting it. ""I've heard this thirdhand. ... That's something I need to listen to the tapes to know,"" he said. Gretz said he was not aware of any icing conditions on the ground at Teterboro that would have required the plane to be deiced. However, he stressed that the investigation is in its infancy and it is too soon to speculate what might have caused the crash. ""It's too early to tell whether it was something mechanical or something the pilot did -- we just don't know,"" he said. Preliminary information is that the five were headed to Atlanta for a combination business-leisure trip, Gretz said. Authorities did not release the names of those who died, pending positive identification by the medical examiner and notification of relatives. But New York investment banking firm Greenhill & Co. reported that those on board were two of the firm's managing directors, Jeffrey Buckalew, 45, and Rakesh Chawla, 36; Buckalew's wife, Corinne, and their two children, Jackson and Meriwether. Ages for the children were not given. ""The plane belonged to Mr. Buckalew, an experienced pilot whose passion was flying,"" the company said in a statement. ""The firm is in deep mourning over the tragic and untimely death of two of its esteemed colleagues and members of Jeff's family."" No one on the ground was injured, although a pickup truck narrowly missed the plane, Gretz said. The debris field from the crash was spread over about a half-mile, with part of a wing and the plane's tail found in a tree in a residential area, he said. Witnesses reported the plane was in an ""uncontrolled spin"" before it crashed. A Federal Aviation Administration radar facility in New York lost radio contact with the plane, and also lost it on radar, FAA spokesman Jim Peters said. The crash site was about 30 miles southwest of the Teterboro airport, Peters said. Gretz said Monday evening he was not sure how long after the conversation regarding icing that the plane dropped off radar, saying investigators will be determining that. The plane struck the southbound lanes of I-287, continued through a wooded median and came to rest on the northbound lanes, New Jersey State Police Lt. Stephen Jones said. Most of the interstate was shut down after the crash, Jones said. One northbound lane and two southbound lanes were open as of Tuesday afternoon, but officials were ""still trying to recover both the pieces of the plane and the remains of the victims."" Gretz said Monday night the wreckage recovery was halted about 6 p.m. because of darkness and would resume after Tuesday's morning rush hour, at 9:30 a.m. The New Jersey Department of Transportation said motorists had two of three travel lanes in each direction available for Monday evening's rush hour.

The first firefighters on the scene attempted rescues within the home, but ""were pushed back by intense flame and heat,"" said Acting Fire Chief Antonio Conte. The cause remains under investigation. Due to the condition of the building, it will be days before investigators can determine what happened, Conte said. Seven people lived in the house, Conte said. He had no immediate information on their identities or the conditions of the two who came out alive and were taken to the hospital. The home is in Stamford's Shippan Point neighborhood, just in from the Long Island Sound, fire officials said.

1700,"(CNN) -- A manhunt is under way in New Jersey as multiple law enforcement agencies search for Arthur E. Morgan III, who is wanted for questioning in the death of a two-year-old girl, authorities said. The girl is believed to be Morgan's biological daughter. A group of boys discovered the child's body partially submerged in a stream in Shark River Park in Monmouth County on Tuesday afternoon, officials said. She was still strapped in her car seat, CNN afffiliate WABC reported. The stream runs directly beneath an overpass, suggesting the child and car seat were thrown from the overpass, said county prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni. Morgan was supposed to return the child to her mother Monday night following a custody visit, Gramiccioni. When he failed to return the child, prosecutors in Ocean County charged him with endangering the welfare of a child and interfering with child custody Tuesday morning. The child was found dead some 20 hours later, WABC reported. A number of federal and state agencies, including the FBI, are involved in the search, suggesting Morgan may try to leave New Jersey where he and the child's mother live separately, Gramiccioni said.","Arthur E.

1701,"(CNN) -- The Philippine government said Tuesday that fresh rain in Visayas and Mindanao could set off flash floods and landslides, bringing the potential for more misery in places already struggling to recover from a deadly tropical storm. Eastern Luzon will experience cloudy skies with scattered rain, while the rest of the island will have mostly cloudy skies with light rain, the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) predicted. On Tuesday, the national government offered a new death toll -- 1,453 -- then revised it again based on a count by Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. The lower count means the death toll from the storm that lashed the southern Philippines more than a week remained unchanged from Monday: 1,249. The bodies of people swept out to sea by flash floods from the storm have washed up on nearby beaches and islands, Maj. Reynaldo Balido, the military assistant for operations at the Office of Civil Defense, said Monday. The authorities have enlisted the help of local fishermen to help the continuing search and rescue efforts for the scores of people who remain missing, Balido said by telephone from the island of Mindanao, the scene of the worst devastation. He added that the fishermen volunteered, since many of them had lost friends and relatives in the disaster. The unusually heavy rains of Tropical Storm Washi, which churned across the southern Philippines between December 16 and 18, resulted in landslides and flash floods that swept away whole villages. The authorities have had to carry out mass burials in order to deal with the large numbers of dead. ""I've gone through many disasters but this one is the worst as some of the survivors have lost so many family members,"" said Richard Gordon, chairman of the Philippine Red Cross. ""Some have lost as many as 30 relatives,"" he said in comments posted recently on the organization's website. The number of people injured as a result of the storm has more than doubled to 4,594 from 1,979 at the weekend, according to the NDRRMC putting more pressure on already stretched relief agencies . The United Nations said last week that the storm has created ""huge"" humanitarian needs in the region. It has made an appeal to raise $28 million to deal with the immediate problems, with tens of thousands of people displaced in and around the port cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro. Many people are lacking food, shelter and clean drinking water, the United Nations said. ""We have also established make-shift camps and relief centers for victims in local schools in the area, but because schools are opening on January 3, we are looking to find them more permanent shelter,"" Benito Ramos, head of the NDRRMC, said. The storm, known locally as Sendong, has affected more than 700,000 people in the region, the NDRRMC estimated Tuesday. President Benigno Aquino of the Philippines has declared a state of national calamity following the storm.

1703,"(CNN) -- A big landslide has ripped through a village in a remote area of Papua New Guinea, killing at least 40 people and leaving 20 others missing, authorities said Wednesday. The country's National Disaster Office said that 40 bodies had been recovered from the debris and search and rescue officers were at the site on Wednesday to assist with the recovery of others. The landslide happened Tuesday in the Komo area in in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, near one of the country's major liquified natural gas fields. Bill Yomba, an official at the National Disaster Office said that the agency thought that excavations carried out by Esso Highlands, a division of the oil company ExxonMobil, for a natural gas project could have set off the landslide. ""This is a very huge landslide that covered a 1 kilometer area,"" said Yomba. ""We are still trying to find out the cause but at this stage we believe the gas project run by Esso Highlands Limited was a contributor because they had been digging for limestone in the area."" The office of Esso Highlands in Papua New Guinea did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment Wednesday.","The landslide takes places near one of the country's largest natural gas fields .

1704,"(CNN) -- An outbreak of illness linked to consumption of tainted cantaloupes has been linked to 13 deaths and 72 illnesses in 18 states, a federal disease agency reported Wednesday. The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported September 12, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 15 people in four states had been infected. The illnesses were traced to consumption of Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms' fields in Granada, Colorado. The deaths reported as of Tuesday morning occurred in Colorado (two), Kansas (one), Maryland (one), Missouri (one), Nebraska (one), New Mexico (four), Oklahoma (one), and Texas (two). The illnesses occurred in those states as well as in California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Listeriosis primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns and adults with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC website. Learn more about various types of food poisoning . Jensen Farms, which is based in Holly, Colorado, is voluntarily recalling Rocky Ford whole cantaloupes that were shipped between July 29 and September 10 and distributed to Illinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The cantaloupes bear a green-and-white sticker that reads: Product of USA- Frontera Produce-Colorado Fresh-Rocky Ford-Cantaloupe or a gray, yellow, and green sticker that says: Jensen Farms-Sweet Rocky Fords. Unlabeled whole cantaloupe should be taken to the retailer for sourcing information, the FDA said. ""Jensen Farms continues to stay committed to the highest levels of food safety and maintains many third-party safety audits, as we have for many years,"" said Ryan Jensen, a partner at Jensen Farms.

1705,"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Two more bodies have been recovered from the wreck of the cruise ship Costa Concordia, Italian officials announced Monday, bringing the number of confirmed victims of the accident to 15. The two women were found on Bridge 4, near the ship's Internet cafe, said Franco Gabrielli, the official in charge of the operation. About 17 people remain missing after the ship collided with rocks January 13 off the coast of Tuscany, according to a CNN count. Salvage workers are to begin pumping fuel out of the liner Monday, Gabrielli said. ""Salvage will start any minute,"" Adm. Ilarione Dell'Anna said Monday afternoon. It will take 28 working days to remove all the fuel from the ship, the admiral said. The search for survivors and victims will continue alongside the salvage, said Gabrielli, the head of Italy's civil protection agency. The man in charge of the rescue operation said the divers faced a grim task. ""Imagine that you left for holidays and that the power went off in your house. What would you find in your fridge? The divers are in there,"" Ennio Aquilino said. Two more bodies were found over the weekend -- one woman on Saturday and one on Sunday, both wearing life jackets. Divers used explosives Monday morning to blow more holes in the side of the ship to allow easier access. The parties involved in the rescue told reporters and residents on the island Sunday that search and rescue efforts will continue -- but that the environmental risk is also becoming urgent. Officials said they cannot predict how long it will take to clear the wreckage, since that depends on maritime conditions and technical difficulties, but all legal, environmental and human factors will be taken into account. ""It's time for Italy to show it can do something right and do it well,"" said Gabrielli. Gabrielli warned that the task ahead was complicated and daunting, not least because it takes about 45 minutes to search each cabin, using special cameras and divers. The giant Costa Concordia had 1,500 cabins on board. A class-action lawsuit will be filed in Miami against Costa and its parent company, Carnival Corp., the Italian consumer group Codacons said on Saturday. The suit, in collaboration with two U.S. law firms, is ""aimed specifically at getting compensation for all damages to the boat passengers,"" Codacons said in a statement. The class-action suit is open to passengers of any nationality, it said. ""We've been contacted by hundreds of victims and the numbers are growing moment by moment,"" said Mitchell Proner, senior partner at Proner & Proner, one of two firms involved. He said crew members have also contacted the firm, ""and their stories that are coming in are horrific -- from lifeboats that were stuck halfway, passengers debating whether to jump or not, this was not an orderly evacuation."" The suit, he said, will request at least 125,000 euros (about $160,000) per passenger. The suit has not yet been filed, said Marc Bern, senior partner at the other firm, Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik, but ""it will probably be in the billions of euros and dollars."" ""The sheer terror of being on a ship of that magnitude going down, you can imagine the psychological damage,"" Bern said. Gabrielli said no fuel oil had yet leaked from the ship -- only kitchen and engine oil -- and that he did not see an immediate risk of the 2,400 tons on board escaping. Booms have been put in place around the ship to stop the spread of oil and other pollutants such as detergents and sewage chemicals. With more than 4,000 people aboard, the ship was the size of a small town, Gabrielli said. Fuel will be replaced with water as it is removed from the ship's tanks, keeping the ship balanced, said Dell'Anna, head of coastal authorities for the port city of Livorno. Gabrielli said Costa Cruises, the company that owns the cruise ship, is cooperative and was proving responsible, despite past errors. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. Prosecutors said they planned to appeal the judge's decision to grant Schettino house arrest, arguing that Schettino should remain in jail because he is a flight risk and because of the gravity of his alleged crimes. Alessandro Antichi, partner of Schettino defense attorney Bruno Leporatti, said the defense plans to file its appeal Wednesday on the judge's ruling. The defense maintains Schettino should not be in custody. An audio recording obtained by Italy's Repubblica newspaper and published Saturday shows that the captain, at least at the outset of the incident, assured authorities he would do the right thing. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members. The vast majority fled the ship safely.

1707,"(CNN) -- The stern of a cargo ship that ran aground last year on a reef off the coast of New Zealand has slipped further underwater, officials said Tuesday, spewing nearly 10 more tons of oil into the sea. Some 21 containers holding a hazardous metal called cryolite -- a by-product of aluminum smelting -- have also slipped off the vessel as it plunged downward, said Maritime New Zealand spokeswoman Michele Poole. ""We had significant storms last weekend and the seas really have not subsided,"" added Poole. ""So it's very rough out there."" Authorities say they do not consider the metals dangerous because they are wrapped in plastic within the container. Should the containers break apart, Poole noted, the metals' toxicity levels would likely be diluted by the surrounding sea water. The metals are not thought to pose an environmental risk, she said. Still, emergency management teams were again placed on alert after monitoring devices aboard the ship -- named the MV Rena -- indicated Tuesday morning that the vessel had further slipped off the Astrolabe Reef, located about 12 nautical miles off the city of Tauranga. Authorities said six little blue, or korora, penguins have since been recovered after new pockets of oil surfaced later Tuesday, but added that they do not expect a need for a major recovery effort. The Liberian-flagged vessel struck the reef in October and has split in two. About 300 tonnes of oil have since leaked from the ship's hull, prompting the country's environment minister to call the spill New Zealand's most significant maritime environmental disaster. Between 200 and 300 containers, comprised mostly of wood and milk products, were also lost overboard when the ship broke apart . ""There is inevitably going to be a lot of mess and disturbance for the next few days while this is cleaned up and we would like people to use common sense and stay well away from the debris -- in some cases this will mean staying out of the water as well as away from material washed up on the beach,"" National On Scene Commander Alex van Wijngaarden said in a statement. Debris from the vessel washed up on a local beach Monday, and a sheen of oil remains visible around the vessel. But officials say they remain wary of committing personnel, particularly underwater crews, to the crash site. ""The wreck is highly unstable,"" noted Poole. ""So it's not worth us risking sending divers down there.""

1708,"Vicksburg, Mississippi (CNN) -- The overflowing Mississippi River dealt anguish to its namesake state Thursday, reaching a historic height at Vicksburg, sending backwater up the Yazoo River, which has swallowed a home owned by the governor, and claiming the life of a 69-year-old man. As the flood's trail of destruction worked its way south, Vicksburg saw the river crest at the expected peak of 57.1 feet early Thursday, hours ahead of the original forecast. The National Weather Service predicts the crest will hold through at least Saturday morning. ""Residents who live along the river need to keep an eye out and be vigilant,"" said Marty Pope, a senior hydrologist with the weather service's Jackson, Mississippi, office. ""We're not going to fall to the kind of levels we got to during the large 2008 flood until early June, and won't fall below flood stage until mid-to-late June."" Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace said the county, which includes Vicksburg, has ""several hundred homes that have water."" About 2,000 residents have been displaced, including nearly 1,000 who were evacuated from Eagle Lake 10 days ago. So far, a critical levee near the lake is holding. Many Warren County residents are accustomed to flooding and know what to do, but none have experienced it at this magnitude, Pace added Thursday. Also of concern is a traffic ""nightmare"" on the principal north-south highway, said Pace. ""We've never seen water that has closed U.S. 61,"" he said. Vicksburg motorists cannot take U.S. 61 to reach Redwood to the north or Port Gibson to the south because of flooded roadway. Instead, commuters are using two-lane roads that weren't designed for the volume, the sheriff told CNN. The river began cresting ahead of schedule Wednesday night, probably because an old levee system in Greenville, Mississippi, was breached last Friday and spread the flood's flow, Pope said. The Mississippi is more than 14 feet above flood stage at Vicksburg and more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927. Water levels in Natchez, a city about 70 miles south, are already nearly 4 feet beyond the record, with the river at 61.9 feet Thursday night -- and the crest isn't expected to arrive until Saturday. A Vicksburg resident, Walter Cook, died after being pulled from floodwater in Warren County, Mississippi, the county coroner said Thursday. It is the first reported death linked to the flooding in the state. Emergency workers with the fire department pulled him from the water at 9:35 a.m. Tuesday and took him to River Regional Medical Center, where Cook was put on life support, Coroner Doug Huskey said. He died early Thursday. Officials do not know how Cook ended up in the floodwater, the coroner said. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was keeping a watchful eye on the Yazoo Backwater Levee, which residents near Vicksburg were counting on for protection. It is designed to keep water from backing into parts of the Yazoo River delta. The backwater levee was being ""armored"" by a heavy plastic coating to prevent it from washing out, said Charlie Tindall, attorney for the Board of Mississippi Levee Commissioners. But the Yazoo River backwaters were already claiming territory and property. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour was among residents who watched rising waters swallow their houses and lands Wednesday. Barbour's spokeswoman confirmed that a house owned by the governor in his native Yazoo County was flooded. The house is on a lake in central Mississippi near the backwater-flooded Yazoo River. A slide was detected on the mainline Mississippi levee at Albemarle Lake, the Corps of Engineers said Thursday. A slide occurs when the integrity of a levee is undermined because dirt and sand are being eroded, said Corps spokeswoman Eileen Williamson. The slide was detected Wednesday and work began immediately to repair it.  ""It will take about a full week to repair,"" she said. Farther south, where the Mississippi River has not yet crested, residents were working to clear out their homes and find ways to get by. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has asked for federal assistance in grappling with flooding resulting from the Morganza Spillway, where 17 bays have been opened in hopes of sparing New Orleans further downstream. ""As water from the Morganza Spillway is released into the Atchafalaya Basin, the impact to our rural communities and the industries upon which they rely will be dramatic and long-lasting,"" Jindal wrote the U.S. Department of Interior, his office announced Thursday.  ""I am requesting your immediate consideration of available assistance and recovery programs for our recreational and commercial fishing, hunting, and eco-tourism industries."" Mandatory evacuations will be in effect Saturday -- beginning at midnight Friday -- in Butte LaRose, Happy Town and the Sherburne Wildlife Management Area, the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office said. By 8 a.m. Saturday, ""the area will be secured and no one will be allowed to enter,"" the parish said in a news release. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate praised the efforts under way along the Mississippi.  ""Fortunately, the system is working as designed between the Army Corps of Engineers and the design structures and where they are having to open the spillways,  they've been able to take pressure off the mainline levee,"" he said at an event in Maryland. Officials said spillway gates are likely to be open for weeks, and it will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage, allowing those who have evacuated to return. The flood is the most significant to hit the lower Mississippi River valley since at least 1937. It has affected nine states so far: Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Although recovery is a while off for areas that have already seen the worst of the floods, Tunica, Mississippi -- about 180 miles north of Vicksburg -- saw another step forward Thursday, with the return of a key economic driver for the region. The Tunica Roadhouse Casino reopened 4 p.m. Thursday, the second to return to business in two days with signs reading, ""We're back y'all."" Casino officials said the reopening celebration included a $50,000 donation to the American Red Cross. ""I didn't know if this day would come or not,"" said R. Scott Barber, the president for the mid-South region for the Caesars Entertainment group. ""It's hard to believe that, just a few short days ago, we had about 4 and a half feet of water in these parking lots."" CNN's Phil Gast and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: Tunica casino reopens, days after over parking lot was under 4 feet of water .

1709,"(CNN) -- Hundred's of fans and former teammates of Robert Enke gathered to lay flowers and light candles outside of Hannover 96's Niedersachsen Stadion after the club's German goalkeeper was struck and killed by a train on Tuesday, in what police called an apparent suicide. Enke, 32, died around 6:25 p.m. (12:25 p.m. ET), Hannover police press officer Stefan Wittke said in a statement. ""Preliminary police investigations indicate a suicide,"" Wittke said. Police did not elaborate on what evidence they had that pointed to suicide, but Enke's close friend and advisor Jorg Neblung told the official Web site of football's world governing body FIFA: ""I can confirm that it was suicide. Robert took his own life shortly before six o'clock."" The team's official Web site has been converted into a single-page memorial. Enke captained Hannover 96, a team who currently lie tenth in Germany's Bundesliga top division,  and had been capped by his national side eight times after making his debut aged 29. The shot-stopper had also appeared for teams including Carl Zeiss Jena, Borussia Monchengladbach, Benfica, Barcelona, Fenerbahce and Tenerife in Spain. His teammates were stunned by news of his death. ""We are in a state of shock,"" said team manager Oliver Bierhoff in a statement from the German Football Federation. ""It is beyond words."" The German Football Federation (DFB) said Enke always said he wanted to play for the national team at the 2010 World Cup. Soccer commentator and journalist Rafael Honigstein told CNN International that Enke was on course to be picked as the number-one choice for the team. Enke had missed Germany's last four matches because of a bacterial infection, but had recently returned to action with Hannover. ""The leadership of the German national team never had any doubt that he was important for the team both as a goalkeeper and as a human being,"" the DFB statement said. Enke is survived by his wife and eight-month-old daughter, who the couple adopted. The couple's two-year-old daughter died in 2006 from a heart condition, and Honigstein said the loss of his child had taken a toll on Enke.

""I don't know why and how this happened,"" said Martin Kind, the chairman of Hannover 96. ""It is a total catastrophe. I am finding it hard to understand. All I can say for sure is that it had nothing to do with football."" Fellow players said they believed that Enke had been suffering depression. ""He was unstable,"" said Mr Kind. ""But he kept it under wraps."" The coach of Germany's national team, Joachim Lowe, had been preparing his squad for their friendly game against Chile this weekend. The DFB have not yet confirmed whether the game would still be played. A press conference is due to be held by the DFB at 1130 GMT, while Hannover 96 will speak to the media at 1200 GMT on Wednesday.

1710,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Former International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch has died of a cardiac arrest at the age of 89. He was with his family when he died, a spokesman at the Hospital Quiron Barcelona told CNN. Samaranch was admitted to the hospital suffering from a serious heart condition, the hospital said on Tuesday. Samaranch, a Spaniard, was made an honorary life president of the IOC after stepping down from his position in 2001. During his tenure, Samaranch was credited with achieving financial security for the Olympic movement by maximizing television and sponsorship deals. He had served in the post for 21 years, making him the longest-serving IOC president. Current IOC President Jacques Rogge took over after Samaranch stepped down. ""I cannot find the words to express the distress of the Olympic family,"" Rogge said in a statement after his death. ""I am personally deeply saddened by the death of the man who built up the Olympic Games of the modern era, a man who inspired me, and whose knowledge of sport was truly exceptional. ""Thanks to his extraordinary vision and talent, Samaranch was the architect of a strong and unified Olympic movement. I can only pay tribute to his tremendous achievements and legacy, and praise his genuine devotion to the Olympic movement and its values. ""We have lost a great man, a mentor and a friend who dedicated his long and fulfilled life to Olympism."" Ed Hula, editor of the Olympics Web site Around the Rings, who knew and interviewed Samaranch, said he was responsible for modernizing the IOC and bringing about fundamental changes. ""He really brought the Olympics from the 20th into the 21st century by encouraging the growth in marketing revenue, TV sponsorship, that underpins the Olympic movement today,"" Hula told CNN. ""He took steps to end the culture of bribery and vote-buying that went on with the selection of Olympic cities. ""Some say he turned a blind eye to it for a long time until he was forced to act, but when he did act, the IOC didn't shy away from punishing and sanctioning those who were involved,"" Hula said. ""He was old world, an old-school IOC member, but at the same time he recognized the need for the IOC to become a much more modern organization."" He remained active in sports administration after stepping down as IOC president. He was hospitalized twice in recent years; in Lausanne, Switzerland in July 2001, shortly after stepping down from his position, and in Barcelona in 2007.","Juan Antonio Samaranch, 89, dies after suffering a cardiac arrest .

1711,"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- In his answers to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge, the captain of the ill-fated cruise ship Costa Concordia admitted he made a ""mistake"" in colliding with rocks off the Italian island of Giglio. However, in statements made during a phone conversation with a friend earlier this month, Capt. Francesco Schettino said managers pressured him to steer the ship to the area where the collision occurred, two Italian newspapers reported Wednesday. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Schettino's behavior. He is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship when the vessel struck rocks and rolled over onto its side in the waters off the island on January 13. A 16th body was found Tuesday on the ship. Sixteen others are missing from the roughly 4,200 people aboard the cruise liner -- 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- at the time of the collision. ""I hit this projection of rock, that seems almost stuck into the ship, but this was my mistake,"" Schettino said in the 126-page transcript. ""... There isn't anything I can say, as I was convinced that passing within .28 of a mile there wouldn't be any problem. The captain also brushed aside suggestions that at 15 knots, he was going too fast, as alleged by prosecutors. ""There isn't a speed limit,"" he said. ""... We had more or less the speed needed to reach Savona on time."" According to the transcript, Schettino maintained he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking. ""This is what allowed me to limit the tilting,"" he said. Maritime lawyer Jim Allsworth told CNN the maneuver is ""fairly standard"" in the case of a ship taking on water and in danger of sinking or capsizing. ""The best thing to do is to put it aground to stop it sinking."" Italian newspapers La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera on Wednesday published excerpts from a telephone conversation Schettino had with a friend after his January 14 arrest. The captain called his friend from the prosecutor's office, and authorities tapped the phone, the newspapers said. Schettino attorney Alessandro Antichi confirmed the wiretap but would not comment on the conversation. The information should not have been published, he said, as it is part of the investigation. ""In my place, someone else wouldn't have been so benevolent to have gone right under there, because they have pissed me off, go, go there,"" Schettino said, in an apparent reference to getting close to the island, according to the newspapers. ""The shallows were there but it wasn't signaled by the instruments that I had and I went through ... in order to follow what the managers wanted."" The man behind the steering wheel, Jacob Rusli Bin, told investigators that after the ship struck the rocks, Schettino cursed and said he had not seen them, La Repubblica reported. Speaking Wednesday before the Italian Senate, Costa CEO Pier Luigi Foschi gave an account of what occurred as documented by Roberto Ferrarini, the company's director of marine operations. The first contact between Schettino and Ferrarini took place about 15 minutes after the collision, at 9:57 p.m. In the call, Schettino told Ferrarini of the crash and said the ship had lost power but assured him the ship could still navigate and the situation was being investigated. In subsequent calls, Foschi said, Schettino updated Ferrarini about the ship taking on water but insisted it could still navigate. Foschi told lawmakers that Ferrarini reported Schettino was calm during the calls. The last call in which the captain reported the situation was under control came in at 10:33 p.m., he said. Two minutes later, Schettino called to tell Ferrarini the ship was being evacuated, Foschi said, adding that Ferrarini was surprised at the sudden change. Ferrarini and Schettino continued to talk during the evacuation, Foschi said, but did not provide further details. Costa cannot conduct an independent investigation because prosecutors seized the ship's data recorder, or ""black box."" The recorder had some connection problems but is working, Foschi said. It contains conversation recordings and navigation system data, he said. Schettino's defense attorney, Bruno Leporatti, filed an appeal Wednesday of a judge's decision to place the captain on house arrest, Leporatti's office said in a statement. Both the prosecution and the defense are appealing the decision -- prosecutors because they believe Schettino should be in custody, and the defense because it believes he should have been released with no restrictions on his movements. In his deposition, Schettino defended his decision not to evacuate the ship immediately. ""It's not like I can have a black out and immediately say, 'Let's all get out of here,' "" he said. ""Where do I send these people? I need to have the certainty and reach my decision on the fact that the ship is like that (no longer capable of floating). I am not going to put at risk the lives of 4,000 people."" Cruise ship passengers described a scene of panic and confusion as they rushed for lifeboats. Some said the crew seemed overwhelmed and did not have accurate information on what was taking place. In the transcript, Schettino also described the chaos, saying he helped passengers onto lifeboats and that some became stuck because of the angle of the listing ship. He said he was trying to launch a lifeboat when he realized he was no longer on board. ""I was then on the lifeboat. It isn't as if I had boarded it,"" he said. ""Look, I fell on its roof."" However, in the wiretapped conversation, Schettino tells the friend, ""When I understood that the ship was tilting, I decided to leave, and left,"" according to Corriere della Sera. A captain's leaving the ship with passengers still aboard is difficult to defend, said Italian criminal defense attorney Ugo Meucci, who does not represent Schettino. ""This is a very difficult position because our law is very strong, and the risk is very high for the captain,"" who could face a 15-year jail sentence, Meucci said. Schettino has resolutely defended his actions after the ship hit the rocks, insisting he kept his bosses at Costa fully informed of the accident's severity. ""The gash (in the ship) was immense,"" the captain said in the wiretapped conversation. ""There was this projection of rock, and then all what I did afterwards, I did it with my most professionalism, and this can help me alleviate or at least give me the illusion to be at peace with my conscience."" He tells the friend. ""I'm proud of the fact that we saved almost all (the passengers). ... I went around picking up people at sea and I'm at peace."" Schettino also tells the friend, ""I don't ever want to go back on ship."" CNN's Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report.","Captain told a friend managers pressured him to steer toward the island, newspapers say .

1712,"(CNN) -- Tammy Faye Messner, the former televangelist and Christian singer who battled drug addiction and later inoperable cancer, died Friday morning, CNN's Larry King said Saturday night. He said the family had asked him to make the delayed announcement. She was 65. Messner was a guest on ""Larry King Live"" on Thursday. She told him she couldn't swallow food, and weighed only 65 pounds. King said the family postponed the death announcement for a day so family members could gather. Messner was cremated and interred in a remote part of Kansas at the Kansas-Oklahoma state line, King said. ""The family appreciates all of the well wishes of so many people,"" the talk show host said on CNN. ""She wanted a party,"" King added. ""They're going to schedule a party in two to three weeks in Palm Springs, California. Her friends will be invited. And she wanted it to be a celebration. ""She died peacefully. Anyone who saw her on our show this week knew that she didn't have long."" King asked her Thursday if she were ""a little scared."" She responded, ""A little bit,"" adding that she mainly worried about her family.  Watch Messner on King's show » . She made dramatic appearances on the now-defunct Christian PTL Network she started with then-husband Jim Bakker, its host. Before millions of viewers, she would often break into tears, prompting her trademark heavy mascara to run. ""Our family is deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Tammy Faye,"" Bakker said late Saturday. ""She lived her life like the song she sang, 'If Life Hands You a Lemon, Make Lemonade.' ""My heart aches for my two children, Jamie Charles and Tammy Sue, who loved their mother dearly. They both told me their mom was so full of life that it is hard to believe she is gone."" Bakker said Tammy Sue stayed with her mother almost around-the-clock in the last year to help care for her. ""Tammy Faye's deep faith in God has kept her throughout her life as well as during these last days of her life. In her last 48 hours, she shared her faith in Jesus Christ on worldwide television with millions of people."" After divorcing Bakker, who became steeped in money and sex scandals, she married Christian construction magnate and former PTL contractor Roe Messner in 1993. She was married to Bakker for more than 30 years. She underwent surgery for colon cancer in 1996. In 2004, she revealed that the disease had spread to her lungs, and in May 2007 she announced that her doctors had stopped trying to treat the illness. In her appearance on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Tammy Faye Messner was a shadow of her former self. ""I believe when I leave this Earth, because I love the Lord, I am going straight to heaven,"" she said. King said she had sought the interview. She told King she was bedridden most of the time, had trouble swallowing food -- hence the weight loss -- and was in near-constant pain. But her sense of humor was still intact. On her Web site, she wrote on Monday, ""I crave hamburgers and french fries with LOTS of ketchup! When I can eat that again, it will be a day of victory!"" Asked by King what she would most like to be remembered for, Messner replied, ""well, my eyelashes."" Messner wore heavy makeup -- her lip liner, eyeliner and eyebrows were tattooed on. Born Tammy Faye LaValley in International Falls, Minnesota, she married Bakker in 1961. From 1966 to 1973, the Bakkers co-hosted ""The 700 Club,"" on the Christian Broadcasting Network, founded by television evangelist and Christian Coalition founder the Rev. Pat Robertson. They began The PTL Club -- with the initials standing for ""Praise The Lord"" or ""People That Love"" -- in 1974 and later expanded it into a television network. At the height of its popularity, PTL was bringing in more than $128 million annually and was carried on 1,300 cable systems with 12 million subscribers. In 1978, the Heritage USA theme park opened at the network's headquarters in Fort Mill, South Carolina. The Heritage USA Grand Hotel was added in 1984 and a water park in 1986. That year, more than 6 million people visited the park, making it the nation's third most popular attraction after Walt Disney World and Disneyland. On March 19, 1987, Jim Bakker resigned from PTL in the face of a scandal involving an affair seven years earlier with Jessica Hahn, a secretary he paid to keep quiet. Hahn received a one-time $115,000 payment and monthly interest payments from a $150,000 trust fund. The following month, PTL filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Also in 1987, Tammy Faye Bakker was treated at the Betty Ford Center for prescription drug addiction. And in December 1988, Jim Bakker was indicted for fraud and conspiring to defraud churchgoers of $158 million. Tammy Faye Bakker was not named in the indictment. In 1989, Heritage USA and the Grand Hotel closed, and Jim Bakker was convicted of 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy and sentenced to 45 years in prison. Tammy Faye Bakker divorced him while he was incarcerated, and Jim Bakker was paroled in December 1994. Asked by King on Thursday what she would change in her life if she could, Tammy Faye Messner replied, ""I don't think about that, Larry, because that's just a waste of good brain space."" When King suggested that she might want to forget the PTL Club, she said, ""I have gotten over that, thank God. That was a terrible, horribly bad experience."" The Bakkers' 30-year-old son, Jay, is a pastor who co-founded the Revolution Church in Brooklyn, New York -- a church aimed at those who feel rejected by traditional approaches to Christianity, stating on the church's Web site that he wrestled with religion after seeing the ""excommunicative"" treatment his parents experienced from the church after the scandal. Tammy Faye Messner has also been known as one of the few evangelical Christians who had the support of the gay community. She was one of the first televangelists to reach out to those with AIDS when it was a little-known and much-feared disease. In return, she told King in July, ""When I went -- when we lost everything, it was the gay people that came to my rescue, and I will always love them for that."" She was able to bounce back after PTL folded. In 1996, she co-hosted the ""Jim J. and Tammy Faye Show"" with gay actor Jim J. Bullock. In 2000, a documentary based on her life, ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"" was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. And in 2003, she appeared on The WB network's reality show, ""The Surreal Life."" Over her life, Messner also recorded more than 25 albums and wrote several books. In 1996, she wrote her autobiography, ""Telling it My Way."" She also wrote ""Run to the Roar,"" a book about overcoming fear, and in 2003 wrote her last book, ""I Will Survive, and You Will Too."" Despite her battle with cancer, Messner told King she kept her Christian faith, instructing her doctors not to tell her how much time they believed she had left. ""I don't have any date written on me anywhere that says I'm going to die at any time, and so I just give it to the Lord,"" she said. Asked if she had a message for her fans, she replied: ""I'd like to say that I genuinely love you, and I genuinely care, and I genuinely want to see you in heaven someday. I want you to find peace. I want you to find joy."" E-mail to a friend .","NEW: Ex-husband Jim Bakker: ""She lived her life like the song she sang""

1714,"Tokyo (CNN) -- An extraordinarily high level of radiation was detected in one spot in a central Tokyo residential district Thursday, prompting the local government to cordon off the small area, local officials said. Radiation levels were higher in Tokyo's Setagaya ward than in the evacuation area around the badly damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, according to ward Mayor Nobuto Hosaka. ""We are shocked to see such high radiation level was detected in our neighborhood. We cannot leave it as is,"" Hosaka told reporters. But the tsunami-struck Fukushima plant may not be the source of the radiation, Hosaka said later on state television. Officials searching for the cause found ""glass bottles in a cardboard box"" in the basement of a house in the neighborhood which sent radiation detectors off the charts, he said on NHK. ""We suspect these bottles in basement could be the cause of the high radiation reading and we are hastily working to confirm it,"" he said. Radiation experts are now checking what contaminated the bottles, a Setagaya ward official told CNN, declining to be named in line with policy. They told the local government there are no immediate health hazards. Radiation levels just a few feet from the contaminated spot are normal, Hosaka said. The Tokyo scare comes a day after officials in Yokohama, Japan's second largest city, investigated soil samples after a radioactive substance was found in sediment atop an apartment building, according to news reports. Yokohama is about 155 miles (250 kilometers) from the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant. The discovery raised concerns that leaked radiation from three Fukushima reactors that suffered meltdowns after the March earthquake and tsunami may be more widespread than thought, The Japan Times reported Wednesday. The U.S. government issued a travel alert last week, warning Americans in Japan to avoid areas near the stricken reactors. The alert recommends that U.S. citizens stay away from areas within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the nuclear facility. The State Department also admonished Americans to stay away from territory northwest of the plant in a zone that Japan calls the ""Deliberate Evacuation Area."" The zone includes Iitate-mura, the Yamagiya district of Kawamata-machi, Katsurao-mura, Namie-machi and parts of Minamisoma.

1715,"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least 17 people were killed Thursday in bomb attacks in a city near Baghdad and the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, police officials said. Police in Baghdad said 10 people were killed, including two women and three children, when insurgents placed bombs around a house in Musayyeb, a city about 43 miles (70 kilometers) south of the capital. Two police officers, who were brothers, were among those killed in the explosion early Thursday, police said. The house was severely damaged. Later Thursday, armed men shot four civilians to death in western Baghdad's al-Yarmouk neighborhood, police said. A fifth civilian died and another 18 were wounded when two bombs exploded in a coffee shop in al-Saydiya, on the south side of the capital. A roadside bomb wounded two people in Baghdad's Abu Dasheer neighborhood Thursday evening, but no fatalities were immediately reported, according to police. Meanwhile, two civilians were killed and three others wounded when a motorcycle rigged with explosives detonated in a mixed neighborhood in southwestern Kirkuk on Thursday morning, police there said. The ethnically mixed, oil-rich city is about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of Baghdad. Since the beginning of the year, a wave of attacks in Iraq has killed about 200 people.

1716,"(CNN) -- Crashes had whittled the expected field from 22 to five, with wreckage from at least a dozen aircraft at one point strewn about the French airfield. But it did not deter between 300,000 to 500,000 from flocking to the Betheny Plain outside Reims for the final event, drawn by the rush of seeing planes turn, twist and race through the air -- and not deterred by the evident risk. That account, from the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission, was from 1909. More than 100 years later, air shows -- which may include air races -- continue to draw millions. In the process, they generate $110 million annually in the U.S. and Canada alone, according to John Cudahy, president of the International Council of Air Shows. A spike this year in fatalities at such events has raised fresh questions about safety. But it has not detracted from the enthusiasm of many aviation enthusiasts, who still view such races as enthralling competitions. ""It's exciting, it's incredibly moving to see these airplanes do what they do and handle the way they are,"" said aviation analyst Jim Tilmon, himself a former pilot in the U.S. military and with American Airlines, who then compared it to its risks and thrills with auto racing and other sports. Such danger was apparent Friday, when pilot Jimmy Leeward's P-51 aircraft plunged into spectators during a qualifying run at the National Championship Air Races and Air Show outside Reno, Nevada. Nine people -- including the pilot -- were killed, with many more injured. A day later, U.S. Air National Guard Lt. Nate Nueller said an aircraft crashed at a show in Martinsburg, West Virginia, killing the pilot. Cudahy noted there had been at least 13 deaths at U.S. air shows this year -- after none for 2009 and 2010. Mike Cummings, crew chief for the Blue Thunder racing team, watched Leeward's World War II-era plane fly over his head, invert, go into a loop, then slam into the ground. He called the crash ""very traumatic (for) the very close-knit"" air racing community, be they people such as himself who knew Leeward personally or other enthusiasts worldwide of the sport. Still, he said it would not deter him from continuing to participate. Nor would he hesitate to bring family members, as he has done often in the past, to watch planes race. ""(My kids) love the air races,"" said Cummings. ""They realize it's dangerous, that it's not a Sunday afternoon in the park."" Air races are sometimes a part of, but distinct from, ""air shows,"" which generally are exhibitions in which pilots demonstrate aerobatics and other aerial moves. In a race, pilots compete against one another to see who can go fastest. There are several forms, the most high-profile being the Red Bull Air Race circuit in which competitors race against a clock and do aerobatic maneuvers, before being compared. Its pilots come from around the world -- Japan, Brazil, England and beyond -- oft competing in picturesque locales in front of hundreds of thousands of people, including well over 1 million recently in Dubai. The Reno race, by contrast, was a lap race. Competitors, typically five to eight at a time, fly a predetermined number of laps in large ovals that range from 3 to 8 miles, depending on the type of plane. And the fledgling Sky Challenge racing circuit is a head-to-head race that melds the two concepts while adding various safety measures. CEO Peter Newport said he is currently criss-crossing the globe for meetings to set up future events. Whatever the air race form, Newport said the common challenge is balancing the desire to maximize both excitement and safety. The latter becomes a bigger challenge than with conventional aircraft, since the pilots -- however well-trained -- are trying to push their planes to the limits. Those involved in such events point out the numerous safety checks in place. Only 320 pilots, for instance, are certified to fly in air shows, much less air races, said Cudahy. And the Federal Aviation Administration notes that its employees closely examine a race course, monitor pilots' practice runs, examine their and their planes' safety records and observe the races themselves. This is all in addition to pre-race inspections of the aircraft. Still, as authorities learned again Friday, there are limits to what can be done when pilots are trying to get the most from their aircraft -- especially if there's an unanticipated mechanical failure. ""An air race is a very, very high-speed race close to the ground with aircraft that have been modified to fly much faster than were originally designed to fly,"" Tilmon said. ""You can call this an extreme sport (because the plane and pilot) are being pushed to the absolute edge."" Newport, for one, believes that new technology can make such events safer without losing any of the sport's luster -- something, he said, is needed to encourage more young people to go into aviation. And he thinks that, once the safety questions are answered, air racing should grow even more popular and take its place among conventional sports like baseball, soccer, golf and the like. ""I think air racing will be the world's predominant sport in 10 year's time,"" said Newport, anticipating it could be a huge spectator and revenue draw without heavy expenses such as building stadiums. ""The challenge is (balancing) excitement and safety... Unless you achieve those two things, it's hard to see how it becomes a global sport.""

1717,"(CNN) -- A preliminary investigation is under way into an altercation that left a high school football coach hospitalized with severe facial injuries after a Georgia football game, a sheriff's investigator told CNN on Tuesday. Inspector Ricky Brown of the Hancock County Sheriff's Department said initial interviews are being conducted into the incident, which occurred Friday night in Sparta between players from Hancock Central and Warren County high schools. Warren County head coach David Daniel was released Monday from an Augusta hospital after surgery to repair broken bones around his right eye, cheek and nose, said Warren County Superintendent Jean Carey. She told CNN he suffered crushed facial and ear bones and an irreparable injury to one of his tear ducts. Carey said Daniel was struck on the side of his head by a helmet when he tried to intervene in the fight, which occurred after Warren County, the visiting team, defeated Hancock Central 21-2. Carey said Hancock Central players attacked Warren County players as they were trying to get into their locker room, which was locked. Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead told CNN that Carey had contacted the regional investigative office in Thomson, which covers Warren County, asking that the state agency investigate. ""However, the incident venue is in Hancock County, not Warren County and, under Georgia law a school superintendent cannot initiate a GBI investigation,"" Bankhead said. ""That request would have to come from the Hancock County Sheriff's Office, who is investigating this incident,"" Bankhead said. Carey told CNN that Daniel ""wants to come back to school and focus on (this Friday's) game right now. But he's got to take care of himself first."" She added, ""All of Warrenton is just real upset."" Daniel was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach the week of the first game this season, after Marleau Blount, a Warren County alumnus, resigned under pressure for having practices with players who had not completed physicals. Blount is now Hancock Central's defensive coordinator. ""It was real unfortunate,"" Blount told the Augusta Chronicle. ""I'm upset at everything."" Sporting events between the schools have been canceled for the rest of the academic year, the Warren County superintendent said. The two schools, which are about 25 miles apart in east-central Georgia, west of Augusta, are members of the same conference.

1718,"(CNN) -- South Africa sent condolences to Nelson Mandela on Monday following the death of his youngest sister and last surviving sibling out of 31 others. Nokuthamba Mandela, 81, died Saturday, South African President Jacob Zuma said. The cause of death was unclear. ""On behalf of myself, the people and government of South Africa, I would like to convey our heartfelt condolences to Madiba and the entire Mandela family at this difficult time,"" Zuma said in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to you in this time of sorrow."" The former president -- affectionately known by his clan name Madiba -- last appeared in public in the closing ceremonies of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. His sister's death came the same weekend he returned to Johannesburg while his home in Qunu undergoes repairs. Mandela, 93, has been living at the house in the Eastern Cape province since last year. Despite his rare appearances following a respiratory infection, Mandela retains his popularity and is considered the founding father and hero of South Africa's democracy. Under South Africa's apartheid regime, Mandela spent 27 years in prison after being convicted of sabotage and attempts to overthrow the government. He was released in 1990 and became president in 1994.","Mandela's sister, 81, dies over the weekend .

1719,"(CNN) -- Joe Paterno was admitted to a hospital Sunday morning after fracturing his pelvis when he slipped and fell at his home the previous night, a source close to the Paterno family said. The injury will not require surgery, the source said. But since the former Penn State football coach is being treated with chemotherapy as he battles lung cancer, doctors have decided to keep him in the hospital. The source did not say which hospital Paterno, who turns 85 later this month, is in or how long he is expected to stay there. Paterno lost his job as the Nittany Lions coach last month amid criticism that he hadn't done more when a sexual assault allegation surfaced regarding his longtime defensive coordinator, Jerry Sandusky. According to a biography on a Penn State website, Paterno was born December 21, 1926, in Brooklyn, New York, and attended Brown University. He joined the Penn State football program after graduating college in 1960, taking over as the team's head coach in 1966. In late October, a Penn State win over Illinois -- the 409th in his head coaching career -- propelled Paterno past Grambling University's legendary former coach Eddie Robinson for the most in NCAA Division I history. A week later, Sandusky -- who coached at Penn State for 23 years and remained a presence on campus after his retirement in 1999 -- was arrested and charged with 40 counts tied to allegations over a 14-year period. Ten additional charges were levied this month. An investigative grand jury's summary of testimony claimed that Sandusky engaged in fondling, oral sex and anal sex with young boys. One of the allegations came from 2002, when a graduate assistant told Paterno he'd witnessed an incident in a shower inside a school athletic facility -- a story that Paterno referred to Athletic Director Tim Curley, but didn't become known to investigators until years later. Curley and Gary Schultz, a university vice president, were both charged with one count of felony perjury and one count of failure to report abuse allegations. Paterno wasn't charged, saying he did his duty by referring the allegations to his superior, according to the grand jury report. But criticism quickly mounted, and Penn State trustees dismissed Paterno and school President Graham Spanier -- who initially backed Curley and Schultz -- days after Sandusky's arrest. Just over a week after the firing, Paterno's son Scott announced that his father has a treatable form of lung cancer. The family learned of the diagnosis after Paterno's follow-up visit for a bronchial illness.

1720,"(CNN) -- Japanese authorities are expected to announce Friday that a ""cold shutdown"" has been achieved at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That would mean the plant's crippled reactors have stayed at temperatures below the boiling point for some time. The announcement is a symbolic milestone. But experts say it will take years -- perhaps decades -- to fully clean up the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. The plume of radioactive particles that spewed from Fukushima Daiichi -- where reactor cooling systems failed in the aftermath of Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami in March -- displaced about 80,000 people who lived within a 20-kilometer (12.5-mile) radius of the plant, as well as residents of one village as far as 40 kilometers to the northwest. The government has yet to determine when those evacuated can return to their homes. Significant work -- with significant risks -- remains to be done at the plant. ""This is far from over, and the work will go on for a long time,"" Tokyo Electric Power Co. President Toshio Nishizawa told CNN this week. Citing government sources, Japan's Kyodo News agency reported Thursday that scrapping crippled reactors at the plant could take up to 40 years. In October, a spokesman for Tokyo Electric -- which owns the plant -- said temperatures in the three reactors where meltdowns occurred had already been brought down below 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit), but the company would have to maintain those conditions for some time before declaring the reactors in cold shutdown. ""They're making this out to be some big milestone, some big thing. But the reality of this is that it's not,"" said Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants. ""The problem is, with these reactors and the condition that they're in, to suggest that they're in cold shutdown really doesn't do justice to the situation. They're no safer today than they were basically in June."" Officials could start removing spent fuel rods from the facility next year, but it could be up to a decade before they are able to access the reactor vessels, he said. ""They'll probably spend two or three years studying it,"" he said. Jack DeVine, who helped lead the cleanup of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant after the 1979 partial meltdown there, said the cold shutdown likely means officials may have one less thing to worry about. If they don't have to use as much water to cool the reactors, they also don't have to worry about what to do with contaminated cooling water -- one of many problems that have plagued workers at the crippled plant. ""It's not like there's a dramatic difference. It's just a gradual incremental difference that does make life easier,"" he said. The earthquake and tsunami on March 11 killed more than 15,000 people in northeastern Japan. The country was on edge for weeks as cooling systems failed and utility and government employees scrambled to prevent a nuclear catastrophe at the six-reactor Daiichi plant, located about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Hydrogen explosions blew apart the No. 1 and No. 3 reactor housings, while another hydrogen blast is suspected to have damaged the No. 2 reactor. Fires believed caused by heat from the No. 4 spent fuel pool damaged that unit's reactor building. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency eventually categorized the accident as a level-7 event -- the highest level on an international scale for nuclear disasters -- putting it on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. ""We are going to check each reactor properly and determine what is going to happen to those left,"" Nishizawa, the Tokyo Electric president, said Wednesday. Removing spent fuel rods is the next step, but officials need to further survey the area before that happens, he said. ""We are considering sending a robot into the fuel tanks to really have a good idea (about) the situation. This will be necessary when we take out the fuel,"" Nishizawa said. ""But I don't believe what we see will be 180 degrees different from our simulations. But as we say, seeing once is better than hearing 100 times, so we will have a good look at what's happening inside."" At Three Mile Island, where damage was less severe and only one reactor was affected, it took two and half years before officials were able to get inside the reactor to assess it, DeVine said. At Fukushima Daiichi, that process will likely take much longer, he said. ""I think in terms of what's ahead, it's still the daunting task that it's always been, which is first of all, figuring out where everything is. ... They're going to be searching for and finding pieces of fuel, chunks of molten material that have now cooled, through all of that rubble,"" he said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Matt Smith in Atlanta, and Licia Yee in Tokyo contributed to this report.","The announcement means temperatures have stayed below the boiling point .

1721,"(CNN) -- President Benigno Aquino of the Philippines declared a state of national calamity on Tuesday after visiting areas in the south of the country that were devastated by a tropical storm over the weekend. The death toll continued to rise from Tropical Storm Washi, which has left tens of thousands of people homeless as aid agencies struggle to deal with a growing humanitarian crisis. Aquino made the declaration in a speech broadcast on national radio after surveying the destruction in the port cities Iligan and Cagayan de Oro on the island of Mindanao, where the vast majority of the dead were found. Figures released by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council put the death toll at 957 early Tuesday. The Philippine Red Cross reported a lower death toll, at 713. Survivors in the area recounted brushes with death as flooding from the storm struck in the middle of the night. Now, they're trying to piece their lives back together. ""We escaped just in time,"" said Rona Magto, a high school teacher and mother of two from Iligan City. ""Those behind us were already flooded and cars were afloat. There was water everywhere and the current was so strong."" Rona and her family survived, but others, including her best friend, Remy Rubio, are missing. Rona has since returned home and started to clean up in an effort to make her home habitable again. But outside her window, she says, she sees emptiness. The area in front of her still looks like a river and behind her, posts are left where there used to be houses. Tropical Storm Washi has affected more than 338,415 people, the disaster council said. About 88,000 people are being served at evacuation centers, according to the Department of Social Welfare and Development. U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement Monday expressing ""deep condolences for the tremendous loss of life and devastation."" He said the United States ""stands ready to assist the Philippine people and government should humanitarian assistance and recovery efforts be needed."" The Red Cross said hundreds of people remained unaccounted for after entire villages were swept away. The government has actually lost count of the number of people missing, said Benito Ramos, head of the disaster council. At least 400 people are missing in Iligan City alone, according to the Department of Interior and Local Government. Military and disaster officials said many people were swept away as they were sleeping. Water-logged bodies from washed-away villages floated at the shoreline on the northwestern coast of Mindanao island. Five people were killed in a landslide, but virtually all the others died in flash flooding after Tropical Storm Washi, which is called Sendong locally. Survivors in the hardest-hit areas are contending with no electricity or clean drinking water. Flash flooding overnight Friday, following 10 hours of rain, fueled the devastation. As much as 20 centimeters (8 inches) of rain fell within 24 hours in some areas. December generally brings about 60 millimeters of rain (a little over 2 inches) to the region, CNN Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri reported. Journalist Sunshine de Leon contributed to this report.","NEW: The death toll from Tropical Storm Washi rises to 957, government says .

1722,"(CNN) -- It should be time to celebrate key milestones in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Recently, the United Nations announced that new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths fell to their lowest levels since the epidemic's peak. Today, 6.6 million people in low- and middle-income countries are on life-saving antiretroviral therapy, and people with HIV are living longer. These gains are significant. But because of the shortsightedness of many wealthy countries, we are once again at risk of losing an opportunity to contain and control this deadly epidemic. The announcement by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) of these gains was quickly followed by much more sobering news. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria -- the main financier of HIV programs around the world -- reported deep funding shortfalls as Western countries shrink or skip their promised Global Fund payments. The Global Fund is freezing expenditures for existing HIV treatment programs and removing hundreds of millions in funding for new programs. The result? Fewer people on HIV treatment, more HIV, more AIDS, more orphans, more misery, more death. The world has been on the cusp of a promising new era in combating HIV before. At the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, the globe's most powerful economies committed to fund universal access to HIV prevention, treatment and care by 2010. The global community fell short by half. Because of that, there were millions of new -- preventable -- HIV infections, with widespread morbidity and mortality and massive economic and social costs. Tragically, the HIV pandemic continued to expand. Earlier this year, at the U.N., the same players renewed their pledge to fund universal access by 2015. Yet we now hear news of shrinking resources in the face of massive need. Let's be clear -- the United States is a leader in funding the fight against HIV. Since then-President George W. Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) launched in 2003, U.S. support has provided millions of HIV-infected people with access to antiretroviral therapy. Today, the U.S. commitment remains strong, through the Obama administration's National HIV/AIDS StrategyÂ in America and Global Health Initiative, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's recent call for an AIDS-free generation. Clinton's goal hinges on a handful of key initiatives, including the immediate expansion of a program known as ""treatment as prevention"" and a corresponding increase in funding for the Global Fund. Treatment as prevention, which calls for widespread testing for HIV and treatment for those testing positive, was pioneered at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS in British Columbia, Canada. Effective treatment of a person living with HIV puts the virus into virtual long-term remission and dramatically reduces its transmission, preventing further infections. Leading global health organizations such as the International AIDS Society, UNAIDS and the Clinton Foundation support the expansion of ""treatment as prevention"" programs worldwide, calling the preventive benefit of treatment a ""game-changer"" in the fight against HIV. Further compelling evidence that treatment as prevention works was provided by a U.S. clinical trial (HPTN052) in May 2011. It found that immediate antiretroviral treatment of an HIV-infected person whose partner does not have HIV reduced AIDS-related morbidity and mortality in the HIV-infected partner by 41% and decreased HIV transmission to the sexual partner by 96%. Together, these results were instrumental in persuading the international community to renew the universal access pledge. UNAIDS says that 12.2 million new HIV infections and 7.4 million HIV-related deaths could be averted between 2011 and 2020 if funding is scaled up to $24 billion annually by 2015. The dollars required are considerable, but -- considering that the G8 pledged $40 billion virtually on the spot for the Arab Spring -- fully affordable. Funding universal access is not just a moral and ethical obligation; it is also highly cost-effective. China gets it. The world's most populous country is implementing a national treatment as prevention strategy to help China meet its goal of bringing HIV and AIDS under control by 2015. Under its program, China conducted nearly 67 million HIV tests in the first 10 months of this year. The global effort to combat HIV cannot afford further delays, as the magnitude and impact of the pandemic grow relentlessly. Today, 34 million people live with HIV and 7.6 million people require treatment. We continue to play catch-up. For every one person who starts HIV treatment, two become infected with HIV. It is time to fully fund the Global Fund, so we can meet the universal access pledge and realize the goal of an AIDS-free generation. Millions of lives depend on it.

1723,"(CNN) -- San Francisco's Candlestick Park was in need of, well, candles after two power outages stalled Monday night's football game between the 49ers and the Pittsburgh Steelers. An initial power outage struck the park shortly before the start of the game, delaying the opening kickoff, football officials said. The second delay hit early in the second quarter, briefly delaying the game, they said. ""Right now, we believe the power outage occurred because of a blown transformer. We have all our available personnel working to confirm that,"" Steve Weakland, a spokesman for the 49ers, said in a written statement. ""There are more questions than answers; we have asked PG&E to assure us and the NFL that this will not reoccur. We will continue to update you as we learn more. "" Pacific Gas and Electric Company said its crews were investigating the cause of both outages at the stadium, which is home to the 49ers. ""While we have many customers at the stadium, Candlestick Park is the only facility impacted,"" PG&E said in a written statement. Crews located a downed power line in the area and were working to determine if it was related to the first outage at the stadium, PG&E said. PG&E is working closely with San Francisco city and county officials and the owner of Candlestick Park to determine the cause, said Geisha Williams, PG&E's executive vice president of electric operations, said in a statement. ""Determining exactly what happened and working to prevent something like this from happening again is very important to everyone involved,"" the statement said. The delays in the game seemed to not hinder the 49ers as they walloped the Steelers in route to a 20-3 victory.

1724,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Russell Armstrong had no alcohol, prescription drugs or illegal substances in his body when he died last month, toxicology results released Wednesday by the coroner concluded. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled last month that Armstrong committed suicide by hanging himself with a rope. He appeared with his wife on Bravo's ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."" Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter dismissed any speculation, raised by a celebrity news website report, that Armstrong could have been murdered. His wife, Taylor Armstrong, agrees that it was a suicide, Winter told CNN. He said she told him in a conversation Wednesday that she does not believe her husband was murdered. Russell Armstrong was found dead at a home in the hills above the Los Angeles suburb of Bel Air last month, police said. His wife had filed for divorce in July, telling People magazine that she was verbally and physically abused during their nearly six-year marriage. Armstrong, who was defending himself against a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, was financially drained at the time of his death, his lawyer Ronald Richards said. His credit cards had been suspended, adding to the pressure, he said. Armstrong complained before his death that the reality show was going to ""crucify"" him in its upcoming season, his mother said last month. John Ann Hotchkiss said she would like to see more investigation into her son's death. ""I don't think he would do this,"" she said Wednesday evening on HLN's ""Issues"" with Jane Velez-Mitchell. ""He loved his family. He loved his children almost to a fault. They were everything to him."" ""Absolutely it was not a suicide,"" said Armstrong's sister, Laurie Armstrong Kelsoe. ""This is real to our family,"" Kelsoe told HLN's Nancy Grace. ""We need to put a face on this man that they have depicted as a monster, and he is not."" CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.","NEW: Mother, sister disagree with finding, want more investigation .

1726,"(CNN) -- Pilot error was mostly to blame for a plane crash that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski and nearly 100 others last year, the nation's investigators said Friday. Unclear instructions from Russian air traffic controllers and bad weather at Smolensk airport also played a part, according to the report released Friday in Warsaw. Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife and many top Polish officials died in the April 2010 crash as they headed to a memorial service to mark the 70th anniversary of a World War II massacre. ""The flight crew of the airplane in question was not sufficiently prepared for the task at hand given the complexity of the situation the crew encountered during their last flight,"" the 328-page report said. ""The aircraft commander, co-pilot, and navigator had been trained hastily, haphazardly and in violation of the respective training regulations."" The report also highlights communication issues between the Polish crew and Russian air traffic controllers at Smolensk. The landing zone controller gave incorrect information to the crew members as they made their descent and ""issued the command to stop the descent and to level out too late,"" the report said. The Russian controllers ""kept informing the Tu-154M crew about the correct position during approach contrary to the actual position of the airplane"" during its descent, which led the crew to believe they were approaching correctly when they were not. The situation was compounded by ""the crew's insufficient knowledge of the airplane's systems and their limitations,"" the report says, and ""inadequate cross-monitoring among the crew members and failure to respond to the mistakes committed."" In addition, visibility for air traffic control and air crew was impeded in bad weather by poor lighting at the airfield and trees on the approach to the runway that were too tall, the report says. In January, a Russian-led investigation concluded that the Polish crew was at fault in the crash. The crew should have decided to divert to another airport in light of ""repeated and timely"" warnings about bad weather in Smolensk, Russia, the Interstate Aviation Committee said. The presence of a Polish air force commander in the cockpit may also have contributed to the crash, the aviation committee said, noting that he had alcohol in his blood at the time of the crash. The Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154 plane crashed on April 10, 2010, in Russia's Smolensk region west of Moscow, killing everyone aboard. They were headed to the village of Katyn to commemorate the 1940 massacre, in which some 22,000 Poles were executed by the Soviet secret police.","NEW: Russian air traffic controllers gave incorrect information to the Polish crew .

1727,"(CNN) -- A 20-day state of emergency was declared Saturday in the Kazakhstan's oil city of Zhanaozen after violent clashes between police and striking oil workers left 10 people dead. The clashes, which injured police officers and involved looting and burning, occurred Friday as the former Soviet state celebrated its 20th anniversary of independence, according to Russian and Kazakh state-run media. ""In order to restore the economy of the town of Zhanaozen, restore the facilities that were burned down and, most importantly, ensure the security of the citizens, I am issuing a decree on the introduction of the state of emergency in the town of Zhanaozen according to the constitution and the law on the state of emergency,"" President Nursultan Nazarbayev said in a statement. ""It will be in force for 20 days, beginning today. If we are able to resolve all issues before then, and if calm is ensured, it can be rescinded at any time,"" the president said Saturday. The Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported Friday that eyewitnesses saw police fire upon unarmed striking oil workers in the country's western oil city, an accusation denied by authorities. Eyewitnesses claim police fired on unarmed striking oil workers in the western town of Zhanaozen on Friday, a charge denied by the authorities. The opposition Social Democratic Party (OSDP) called for an emergency panel to investigate, and the commission should be made up of ""senior officials, striking oil workers, and representatives of the public and press,"" the Russian news agency reported. The violence erupted as police tried to clear protesters from the town's main square that was occupied by workers for more than six months, the Russian agency said. The president provided a different account saying ""a group of hooligans"" attacked ""peaceful citizens"" gathered on the central square to commemorate independence. ""In response to the demands of the police to stop their illegal actions, the group of hooligans attacked police officers seeking to seize their weapons. Yet, the police officers did not allow that to happen,"" Nazarbayev said. The mayor's office and a nearby village's administrative office, a hotel and an office building were burned during the violence, the president said. Also torched were cars, he said. Banks, ATM machines and shops were looted, he said. ""A total of 46 facilities were attacked. In that small town, almost all facilities were attacked, burned or destroyed,"" the president said.","Ten people were killed when police and striking oil workers clashed in Zhanaozen .
The violence occurred as the country celebrated independence day .

The latest case of Cronobacter infection occurred in Florida, the update said. After cases occurred in Missouri and Illinois, authorities looked for other cases, and found an Oklahoma case and the one in Florida. The Florida and Missouri infants died this month of their infections. The Missouri case prompted retail giant Wal-Mart to pull all cans of the same size and lot number of baby formula from its shelves. But DNA fingerprinting of the bacteria from the Missouri and Illinois cases found the bacteria differed, suggesting they were not related, the agencies said. Bacteria from the other two cases were not available for testing, they said. In the Missouri case, Cronobacter bacteria were found in an opened bottle of nursery water and prepared infant formula, but it was not clear how they became contaminated, the update said. Tests on factory-sealed containers of powdered infant formula and nursery water with the same lot numbers turned up no Cronobacter bacteria, it said, adding, ""There is currently no evidence to conclude that the infant formula or nursery water was contaminated during manufacturing or shipping."" Formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition said the agencies' test results corroborated its own. ""We're pleased with the FDA and CDC testing, which should reassure consumers, health care professionals and retailers everywhere about the safety and quality of our products,"" Tim Brown, senior vice president and general manager for North America, said in a statement. ""These tests also reinforce the rigor of our quality processes throughout our operations."" Cronobacter infection typically occurs during the first days or weeks of life. In a typical year, the CDC said, it learns of four to six such cases. This year, with increased awareness of the infection, it has tallied 12 cases. The bacteria can cause severe infection or inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain. Symptoms can start with fever, poor feeding, crying or listlessness. ""Any young infant with these symptoms should be in the care of a physician,"" the update says. The bacteria can be found in the environment and can multiply in powdered infant formula once it is mixed with water, said the CDC, which recommends breastfeeding whenever possible. Cronobacter is fatal in nearly 40% of cases, according to the CDC. Infection survivors can be left with severe neurological problems.

1729,"(CNN) -- Residents of the Southwest are bracing for a blizzard to kick off the holiday week with heavy snows, strong winds and icy roads that could make driving across the region dangerous. The snow is forecast to start battering northeast New Mexico in the wee hours of Monday morning. State emergency personnel and transportation crews there are on call, officials say, ready to act if and when the storm hits hard. Residents, meanwhile, have made their own preparations -- even on an otherwise picturesque day on Sunday, with sunny skies and temperatures in the 60s in some locales. ""I went to the grocery store, and it was packed,"" said Kevin Mueller of Tucumcari, where he and his wife run the historic Blue Swallow Inn. ""People are out there, stocking up."" The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning for much of Monday and Tuesday in large swaths of northeast New Mexico, southeast Colorado, southwest Kansas, northern Texas and the Oklahoma Panhandle. Winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories are in effect for other parts of all those states as well. That means places like Santa Rosa, New Mexico, and Springfield, Colorado, could see up to 2 feet of snow, though 8 inches to 16 inches will more likely be the norm and lesser amounts may fall in other locales. That snow will combine with potent winds, which are expected to be between 25 and 45 mph in spots. The storm is the product of a ""sharp blast of cold air"" from the north that will turn rain into snow and possibly lead to ""white-out conditions,"" the weather service said. ""Travel will become dangerous, if not impossible across the region,"" the weather agency's New Mexico division predicts. Are you there? Share photos, video . About 700 New Mexico highway personnel are set to clear the roads, with plenty of road salt also on hand to deal with ice, said Manon Arnett, a spokeswoman for the state transportation department. Those crews will be out focusing first on interstates, then on other roads, she added. If visibility diminishes or the roadway gets too slick, it will be up to state police as to whether a given thoroughfare is temporarily shut down, according to Arnett. While the traffic management center opened at 7 p.m. MST (9 p.m. EST) Sunday, New Mexico had not activated its 24-hour emergency center as of then. State emergency management spokesman Nick Piatek said personnel are on call, with food and fuel sources ready to transport to those who need them. Private companies are trying to get ahead of the storm as well. Drivers have been prepped, trucks have been filled with fuel, and tire chains are available for those at All-Rite Towing and Repair in Tucumcari, according to a long-time employee there who asked only to be identified as Linda. ""It's going to be a big one for us,"" she said, warning that hard-to-see ""black ice"" may slip up drivers and electricity outages could close gas stations. Southeast Colorado is also expected to experience blizzard conditions, with the National Weather Service warning people to ""avoid traveling in the area."" ""Life-threatening winter weather conditions are expected,"" the agency said. No flights had been canceled as of Sunday night at Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport in north Texas, said aviation director Patrick Rhodes. But the officials there have talked about what to do next at a planning meeting Sunday, including getting the airport's six snow plows ready. ""We're on the dividing line between 3 inches and 9 inches (of snow),"" he said. Amarillo residents were told to expect rain overnight that will switch to snow Monday afternoon. In Tucumcari, Mueller said his inn has emptied, like many store shelves, ahead of the storm. He's hoping the wintry weather won't prevent his son, who is set to fly in from Kentucky on Tuesday, from reuniting with the family in time for Christmas. As for unexpected guests at the inn, Mueller said that he has a plow ready to clear the driveway and rooms are ready for snow-weary travelers. ""We plan to leave our lights on,"" he said. ""If we get calls, we're ready to help."" CNN's Greg Botelho, Jessica Jordan and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Transportation and emergency crews are on call in New Mexico, officials say .

1731,"(CNN) -- The death toll from the suspected attack on the Dutch royal family has continued to rise as more details emerged about the man who slammed his car into a crowd during a holiday parade. A car is pictured after crashing into the crowd waiting for the visit of the royal family in Apeldoorn. The Dutch defence ministry announced late Friday that a military policeman, 55-year-old Roel Nijenhuis, had died in hospital -- bringing the death toll to seven, including the suspected attacker. Twelve people were also injured in the attack. The driver, who has not been officially identified, died in hospital in the early hours of Friday from head injuries, as it was revealed that he had lost his job as a security guard and was about to lose his home. ""Recently, he informed me that he had been dismissed and could no longer pay the rent,"" landlord Sem Bosman told De Telegraaf newspaper. ""He was due to have come today to transfer the keys to a new tenant."" The 38-year-old was described by his former landlord and neighbours as quiet, solitary, friendly, soft-spoken and a ""dark horse,"" according to AFP news agency. The man, whose name was not released, had been seriously injured in the crash Thursday in the town of Apeldoorn, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) east of Amsterdam, police said. He had been charged with trying to attack the royal family, authorities said. Were you there? Send us your video, images . Police searched the man's house but found no weapons, explosives, ""or any other clues that could lead to the involvement of other people,"" police said. Crowds had lined the streets to see Queen Beatrix and her family ride by in an open-top bus during the Netherlands' annual holiday of Queen's Day.  See who the Dutch royal family are » . As the bus moved along, a small black car zoomed past it. The crowds were behind barriers off the road, but security officials and journalists, including many cameramen, were in the road as the Suzuki car went by. The car crashed into the low metal railing around a column on the side of the road. The vehicle appeared heavily damaged even before the crash, but the reason for that was unclear. There was no one other than the driver in the car at the time, police spokeswoman Esther Naber said. Members of the royal family saw the crash and gasped, then quickly sat down as the bus continued driving. The attack caused outrage in the Netherlands, newspapers Friday widely expressing disbelief and suggesting the monarchy would have to change. ""Queen's Day will never be the same,"" the Trouw newspaper said. ""The Netherlands always has been proud of their no nonsense royal family. With this comes a queen who not only cycles a bike, but also mixes with people without obvious security measurements. Is that still possible now the royal family has been the target of an attack?"" The Algemeen Dagblad newspaper agreed. """"What is going to happen on the 30th of April next year? And will we continue to see the members of the royal family cycling through the canals of Amsterdam or hunting for bargains in the Bijenkorf in The Hague?"" Queen's Day is a national holiday in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Aruba. The tradition started in 1885 and celebrates the birthday of the queen. Although Queen Beatrix's birthday is January 31, she officially celebrates her birthday April 30, according to the Dutch government. Queen's Day is known for its free market all over the country, where anybody is allowed to sell things in the streets. Other activities include children's games and musical performances. The day is marked with the color orange all over the country as a reference to the colors of the royal family, who come from the House of Orange-Nassau.

1733,"(CNN) -- The Philippine authorities have significantly revised down the death toll from a strong earthquake that shook the country's third-largest island on Monday. The state-run Philippines News Agency had reported Tuesday that the number of people killed by the 6.7-magnitude quake off the coast of Negros had climbed to 48. It cited the Philippine Army, which was basing the figure on information from local government units. But PNA later reported that the army had reduced the total to 22 confirmed dead after it ""learned that not all believed dead in various towns and cities were accounted for."" The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council on Wednesday put the official death toll at 26, with 71 people still missing. The quake in the central Philippines on Monday damaged houses, churches and many other buildings. It also set off landslides and has left at least 10 bridges unusable. The area near the quake continued to be rattled by aftershocks Wednesday. The Philippines is situated in the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. CNN's Karen Smith contributed to this report.","State media had cited the Philippine Army as saying the death toll was 48 .

1734,"CNN -- The number of cholera deaths in Zimbabwe is now approaching 3,000, the World Health Organization says. Two men rest in a cholera rehydration tent on the South Africa-Zimbabwe border in December. Latest, WHO statistics show 2,971 deaths since the outbreak began in August, with 56,123 cases reported. The epidemic has swept through a country wracked with political and economic crises. Cholera is an intestinal disease caused by bacteria in contaminated water. The epidemic has been aggravated by erratic water supplies, shortages of water purification chemicals, broken water and sewer pipes and uncollected garbage. On top of that, the waste-disposing system has collapsed. Children can be seen playing on heaps of uncollected garbage in the suburbs of most urban areas in Zimbabwe. Last month, the government led by President Robert Mugabe declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency. The country already was wracked by an enormous economic crisis, with a hyperinflationary economy and shortages of all essentials including food, fuel, cash, foreign currency and electricity. Zimbabwe's rainy season peaks in January or February and ends in late March, and Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned the epidemic could get worse during the rainy season.","WHO figures show 56,123 reported cholera cases in Zimbabwe .

1735,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Zimbabwe's prime minister believes the driver of the truck that struck his car, killing his wife, deliberately drove toward them, his party told CNN. Morgan Tsvangirai leaves the hospital Saturday after being treated for injuries from a car crash. Members of his political party, the Movement for Democratic Change, and former U.S. diplomat also say the crash raises suspicions of foul play. The prime minister left a hospital Saturday, a day after his wife, Susan, was killed in the collision, officials said. A ball cap covered Tsvangirai's bandaged head. Tsvangirai was taken to a hospital in Gaborone, Botswana, on Saturday for medical treatment, a Botswanan government source and a source with the prime minister's party. ""He's badly bruised and is receiving treatment,"" the Botswanan government source said. The source with the prime minister's party said Tsvangirai will return to Zimbabwe on Wednesday to attend the funeral of his wife. The couple, who were married in 1978, have six children. The crash happened on a two-lane highway between Tsvangirai's hometown, Buhera, and the capital, Harare. It comes only weeks after the start of a power-sharing agreement between Tsvangirai and his political rival, President Robert Mugabe. Tsvangirai's political party said Friday that it was too early to tell whether the crash was anything other than an accident. But on Saturday, MDC members told CNN that Tsvangirai thought the crash was deliberate. Tendai Biti, the MDC secretary-general, speaking during a tearful press conference, said Tsvangirai should have had better security.  Watch how the accident threatens to derail the unity government » . ""If there had been a police escort maybe what happened yesterday could have not have happened,"" Biti said. ""(A) police escort would have warned oncoming vehicles of a VIP arriving. I think authorities must understand the omission. ""We hope that this omission will be rectified, that the prime minister must be given the protection that ought to be accorded to a prime minister."" Biti said the MDC would launch its own investigation. Analysts say the crash raises suspicions of foul play. One former U.S. diplomat called for an outside investigation, saying it was not the first time one of Mugabe's political foes had been killed or injured in a car crash. Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe's main opposition leader, took office last month under a power-sharing deal with Mugabe following a contentious election. The MDC reached the agreement with Mugabe in September after months of angry dispute that included violence. More than 200 deaths, mainly opposition supporters, were reported leading up to and after the election. ""I'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure,"" said Tom McDonald, the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001. ""President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone lo and behold dies -- it's sort of his M.O., of how they get rid of people they don't like.""  Watch more on the fatal crash » . McDonald cited the car crash deaths of Defense Minister Moven Mahachi in 2001, Employment Minister Border Gezi in 1999 and Elliot Manyika, a government minister and former regional governor, last year. ""So when I hear that Tsvangirai was in an accident, it gives me pause,"" McDonald said. Now an attorney with the Washington law firm Baker Hostetler, he urged a full independent investigation. However, he added that traffic accidents are common in Zimbabwe. The highway Tsvangirai was traveling on was only two lanes and tractor-trailers were common, McDonald said. Vehicles in the country were often in bad shape and drivers inexperienced. ""It's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things,"" he said.

1736,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- The ""humanitarian situation remains serious"" in Zimbabwe amid cholera, starvation and a continuing economic crisis, a United Nations official said Wednesday at a World Humanitarian Day ceremony in Harare. The cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe resulted in nearly 100,000 cases, 4,288 of them fatal, the U.N. said. ""Although Zimbabwe is not facing armed conflict, humanitarian threats such as food shortages and outbreak of diseases such as cholera pose a significant challenge,"" said Agostinho Zacarias, U.N. Development Programme representative in the country. ""The recent [cholera] epidemic resulted in 98,592 cumulative cases, including 4,288 deaths between August 2008 and July 2009."" Cholera  thrives in areas without clean water and proper sanitation, and the United Nations has said 6 million people in Zimbabwe -- more than half the population -- have limited or no access to safe water and sanitation in rural and urban areas. It also estimates more than 5 million in the nation face starvation. Although the cholera epidemic was declared under control last month, a renewed outbreak is likely, international health officials have said. Zimbabwe's humanitarian situation was worsened by its economic collapse last year. The nation's coalition government, formed six months ago by former political enemies President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, is seeking more than $8 billion to aid its recovery. A U.N. appeal launched earlier this year has so far raised only 44 percent of its goal of $718 million for humanitarian assistance. But Rueben Marumahoko, a Zimbabwe junior minister and an appointee of Mugabe, said the country is no longer in crisis. ""There is need for Zimbabwe to move from the humanitarian support stage to the recovery stage,"" he said. ""Zimbabwe is no longer a country in crisis but a country in recovery."" The comment drew laughter from many journalists covering the event. Among the nation's problems is a strike by doctors that is almost a month old. The doctors are demanding housing and car allowances and a monthly salary of $1,000 [U.S.] -- a sharp rise from the current $170 a month paid to all public servants. Nurses joined the strike this week, saying that doctors have a genuine case that needs urgent attention. The action is threatening the country's ability to deal with H1N1 influenza, also known as swine flu, and to prepare for the possible resurgence of the cholera epidemic.","U.N.: More than 5 million Zimbabweans face starvation .

1737,"(CNN) -- A blizzard that roared through much of the southern Rockies and central Plains tapered off Wednesday, but several states were still expected to deal with heavy snow. Winter weather watches, warnings and advisories were in effect Wednesday for much of the West, according to the National Weather Service. The higher elevations of the Rocky Mountains were expected to get hit the hardest, with some likely to be coated with up to 15 inches of snow in the coming days. Other areas could get eight inches, the weather service said. The storm could make travel on some roads ""very hazardous or impossible,"" the weather service warned. Are you there? Tell us about it . This was the case on some roads Tuesday as blizzard warnings stretched from southeast Colorado through western Kansas, the Oklahoma panhandle and far northern Texas. Interstates and highways were shut down Monday night as at least five states contended with heavy snow, fierce winds and ice. New Mexico State Police shut down Interstate 40, a major east-west artery from Albuquerque to the Texas state line, saying there was zero visibility because of blowing snow. Interstate 25 was shut down from just north of Albuquerque to the Colorado state line because of the blizzard conditions, which included snow-packed and icy roads. One of the many stalled by the storm Tuesday was Linda Martinez, who had planned to take the interstate into New Mexico with her husband and daughter, according to CNN affiliate KXRM. Instead, she was stuck in her car at a gas station in Colorado City staring at the heavy snow gusts. ""We've traveled in storms like this before, but looking at it now, I don't want to chance it,"" Martinez said.

1738,"(CNN) -- The Indiana Department of Labor on Wednesday announced penalties totaling $80,800 following a worker-safety investigation into a stage collapse last summer that fatally injured seven people and injured dozens of others before a scheduled concert at the Indiana State Fair. The largest fines -- totaling $63,000 for what the agency said were three ""knowing violations"" -- were levied on Mid-America Sound Corp., which built the stage structure and leased it to the fair. Metal scaffolding supporting the stage lights fell onto a crowd of fans and workers as a storm swept through the Indianapolis fairgrounds on August 13, 2011, right before country music group Sugarland was to perform. Mid-America Sound, based in Greenfield, Indiana, was cited for ""failure to develop and implement an Operations Management Plan, the failure to develop a risk assessment plan, failure to maintain and use current engineering calculations and documentation, and failure to provide appropriate, qualified supervision,"" the labor department said. The company strongly disputed those findings in a statement to CNN Wednesday night. The citations come as the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration (IOSHA) released the findings of a six-month investigation focusing specifically on employee safety standards. Two workers were among the people killed. Labor Department Commissioner Lori A. Torres said the citations of Mid-America Sound indicated ""the most serious safety violation."" ""The evidence demonstrated that the Mid-America Sound Corporation was aware of the appropriate requirements and demonstrated a plain indifference to complying with those requirements,"" Torres said during a morning news briefing at the state capitol in Indianapolis. Also, the Indiana State Fair Commission was cited for failing to evaluate and assess ""all conditions and the related appropriate safety measures"" at the fair's concert venues. The ""serious violation"" resulted in a $6,300 penalty. And the local chapter of the stagehands union (IATSE) and Theatrical Payroll Services Inc. were cited for four violations and fined $11,500 for failing to make sure the load-bearing roof was properly secured. State Fair Commission Chairman Andre Lacy issued a statement Wednesday saying the organization has created a new position of emergency management officer ""to assist with improving emergency action plans, and completed emergency evacuation training for all employees."" He also noted that two independent investigations are ongoing ""regarding the structural collapse and decision-making analysis."" ""Our hearts continue to go out to the victims and families of those whose lives were forever impacted by the events of Aug. 13,"" Lacy said in the statement. ""We also appreciate the due diligence of the Indiana Department of Labor in compiling its report."" An attorney for the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees told CNN Indianapolis affiliate WTHR that the state fair was making ""scapegoats"" of the stagehands union. ""(This is) an attempt to deflect attention away from themselves,"" WTHR quoted attorney Bill Groth as saying. ""The State Fair Commission and State Fair personnel are ultimately responsible here. And they're looking for scapegoats and we happen to be first in line."" Byra Borshoff Cook, a spokesperson for Mid-America Sound, said the company disagrees with the investigation's findings ""and strongly object to their classification as knowing violations."" ""Mid-America Sound was consistent and clear with the Indiana State Fair Commission about the limitations of the temporary roof structure in high winds or severe inclement weather,"" she said in an e-mailed statement. ""Each year for nearly a decade, we warned the Commission, in writing, that 'The roof or top shall not be used in high winds and or severe inclement weather. High winds meaning 25 MPH and above,'"" Cook said, quoting a clause highlighted on a ""conditions of contract"" page that also was attached to the e-mail sent to CNN. ""In the case of the structure used for the Sugarland concert, the threshold was 40 mph for evacuation,"" Cook's e-mail stated. ""On the evening of the incident one of our employees reconfirmed with State Fair leadership that if there was lightning or wind speeds of 40 mph or more, the area should be evacuated. ""Despite these warnings, the Indiana State Fair Commission, who controlled the venue, and Sugarland, who controlled the concert, refused to postpone the concert and failed to implement an evacuation plan away from the temporary roof structure."" The National Weather Service estimated winds of 60-70 mph were raking the area when the incident occurred. Forecasters had warned that heavy rain and strong winds would hit the fair nearly two hours before the storm moved through. Video shows the blue canvas top fraying and flapping just seconds before the steel scaffolding gave way and fell onto the ""Sugarpit,"" a section usually occupied by Sugarland's most ardent fans. Authorities had gone onstage just four minutes earlier to warn the crowd to seek shelter, according to a timeline of events released by investigators the day after the accident. Sugarland, the Atlanta-based duo of Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, escaped injury since they had not yet come onstage. They later posted a message on Twitter saying they were ""stunned and heartbroken for the fans."" In November, the families of four people who were killed filed a lawsuit against Sugarland, contending it was the performers' responsibility to decide whether the show would go on and that they had ""ultimate control over the lighting"" that fell on many of the victims. Sugarland's representative has said the group would offer no comment about the lawsuit.

1739,"(CNN) -- The roadside bomb that smashed into Army Sgt. Brian Saaristo's Humvee in northern Iraq two years ago ripped off both legs below the knee. Retired Army Sgt. Brian Saaristo, who lost both legs to a roadside bomb, meets with a doctor in Minnesota. Now he's 45, living in retirement in Minnesota and confronting the rest of his life without the use of his legs. Yet he worries mainly about the thousands of younger U.S. service members who also have been maimed by makeshift bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Younger ones are taking it harder,"" Saaristo said. ""They feel they don't have the rest of their lives."" Roadside bombs and other homemade explosives have been a deadly staple of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, killing or wounding thousands of U.S. service members and civilians. Such improvised explosives devices -- ""IEDs"" to the military -- are the ""weapon of choice"" for insurgents, U.S. officials say. They're mostly cheap, easy to build and triggered by simple remote control. Protecting U.S. troops from such bombs is a top priority at the Pentagon. It has spent $14 billion in the past four years to fight homemade bombs. It even created an agency for that purpose -- the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization. That agency has had some success, a new report says, but insurgents continue to kill and maim U.S. service members with homemade bombs, in part because the bombs fulfill their purpose and it is easy to acquire the materials used to construct them. The report came from a subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. It followed two years of hearings and study. The number of IED attacks has dropped in Iraq and gone up in Afghanistan, said Irene Smith, a spokeswoman for the IED organization. Yet there are more than 1,400 such attacks a month in Iraq and Afghanistan and an additional 350 elsewhere, a sign that insurgents continue to rely on them. ""We are in a long war, a persistent conflict with a group of insurgents who want to wear down our will so we quit -- the purpose of an IED,"" she said. ""The enemy recognizes IEDs as the weapon of choice."" The IED agency has developed and fielded electronic jammers that prevent the bomb's trigger signal from reaching the explosive, the congressional report said. It also has pursued better vehicle armor. The agency has been developing intelligence, fostering police work, funding surveillance and attacking insurgent networks that produce and set up the bombs. It has been involved in training troops on how to confront and look for the weapon. Yet the report said the group needs to improve the way it measures its performance, because it isn't clear in many cases whether the group's actions or other factors have led to various strides in confronting roadside bombs. The report also said the organization needs to widen its authority to include other agencies that confront roadside bombs, and get better oversight. Smith, the spokeswoman for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, agrees with these conclusions. She said the organization appreciates the opportunity to work with the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, ""to identify and resolve any problem areas in our processes."" She said the cooperation among agencies is crucial. ""Global terrorism will continue to manifest itself through use of IEDs,"" she said.","Number of homemade bomb attacks down in Iraq, up in Afghanistan .

1740,"(CNN) -- Two bombs went off at separate locations in the Northern Ireland city of Londonderry, police said Thursday. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said people had been moved from both areas after telephone warnings and there were no reports of injuries. One of the blasts was on Strand Road, near government offices and police headquarters. The other was near a tourist office at Foyle Street. The police commander for the city, Chief Superintendent Stephen Martin, branded the attacks ""reckless."" He praised his officers for quickly evacuating businesses and homes, including many elderly residents. ""Thankfully we are not dealing with mass casualties or worse this evening,"" said Martin. ""The people of Derry do not want this - it is cowardly and callous."" Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second largest city, has a Catholic majority and is known as Derry by many residents. Local politicians are blaming Irish Republican Army splinter groups for planting the bombs. There have been several attacks by so-called ""dissident republicans"" in the city during recent years since the mainstream IRA declared a cease-fire. The IRA for decades fought against British authorities in Northern Ireland, but has since renounced violence. The former Social Democratic and Labour Party mayor of the city, Irish nationalist Colum Eastwood, condemned Thursday's attacks. ""This was an attack on the people of Derry by the enemies of Ireland. Those behind this are engaged in a futile and morally bankrupt campaign."" Leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party, Tom Elliott, said, ""I have no doubt the bombs are the work of so-called ""dissident"" republican terrorists. ""We have seen this type of attack before during the troubles when the IRA blitzed Londonderry on a regular basis,"" Elliott said. ""Those attacks failed to break the will of the unionist people and these attacks will fail, too. These attacks further no cause."" Elliott called for a security crackdown by British authorities and urged anyone with information on the bombers to give it to police. ""This type of fascism was part of our past.

1741,"(CNN) -- A 4.0-magnitude earthquake struck eastern Ohio on Saturday, one week after a similar but smaller tremor rattled the region, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake was centered 5 miles northwest of Youngstown and 6 miles southeast of Warren, the agency said. The quake's epicenter was 55 miles east-southeast of Cleveland, and 145 miles northeast of Columbus. According to the preliminary estimate, the earthquake struck 1.4 miles deep. There was a lot of shaking ""and a rumbling sound,"" said Jimmy Hughes, a former Youngstown police chief running for sheriff of Mahoning County. ""I could see the house move... It seemed like the ground was moving. "" The quake struck one day after Ohio Department of Natural Resources Director James Zehringer announced that work would be halted on a fluid-injection well in Youngstown, due to fears it could be contributing to a recent apparent spike in seismic activity in the area. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, an injection well ""is a device that places fluid deep underground into porous rock formations, such as sandstone or limestone, or into or below the shallow soil layer."" The decision came after the state of Ohio invited experts from Columbia University to collect more information about seismic activity in the area. The well is owned and permitted to North Star Disposal, a Youngstown company, according to the state. ""While conclusive evidence cannot link the seismic activity to the well, Zehringer has adopted an approach requiring prudence and caution regarding the site,"" the department said in a press release. Ben Lupo -- CEO of D&L Energy, an independent natural gas and oil exploration, production and marketing group that oversees the North Star well -- recently told CNN affiliate WKBN that there's full cooperation with experts, though he expressed grave doubts that the injection wells were to blame for the quakes. ""We have approximately 1,000 wells between Ohio and Pennsylvania and we've never had a problem ... with an earthquake or spill,"" Lupo said. One of the Columbia University experts, Dr. Won-Young Kim, said that a problem could arise if fluid moves through the ground and affects ""a weak fault, waiting to be triggered."" He explained the underground waste ""slowly migrates"" and could cause issues miles away, adding that the danger could persist for some time as the water travels and seeps down toward the fault. ""In my opinion, yes,"" the recent spate of earthquakes around Youngstown is related to this fluid-injection well, Kim claimed -- though there has been no definitive determination, by the state or authorities, indicating as much. There have been ""moderately frequent"" reports of earthquakes in northern Ohio since the first one was reported in 1823, the federal agency noted. A 1986 tremor, measuring magnitude 4.8, caused some damage. Another in 1998 measured a 4.5 and was centered in northwestern Pennsylvania. According to the Ohio Seismic Network, a 2.7-magnitude earthquake struck around Youngstown around 1:24 a.m. on December 24. ""No damage was reported,"" the network said on its website. The state of Ohio has documented 11 ""seismic events"" in 2011 -- each of them, at that point, of magnitude 2.7 or lower. The Department of Natural Resources Director noted that a 4.0 magnitude quake, like the one on Saturday, releases approximately 40 times more energy than a 2.7 magnitude tremor. Youngstown police Sgt. Michael Kawa said that the latest tremor ""shook the whole building we were in,"" but that there were no signs of significant damage in the city. That appeared to hold true elsewhere in the eastern Ohio city, based on early post-quake surveys. ""A lot of house alarms, it shook the buildings,"" Kawa said of the aftermath. ""The fire department hasn't reported any major damage."" Within just over three hours of the quake, nearly 4,000 people from 357 zip codes and 23 cities -- including one as far as Salem, Massachusetts, 515 miles from the epicenter -- had submitted reports to the U.S. Geological Survey's ""Did you feel it?"" form on its website. Ohio is far from the Earth's major tectonic plates, with the nearest ones in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, the U.S. Geological Survey explains on its website. Still, there are many known faults in this region, with the federal agency noting that it is likely there additional ""smaller or deeply buried"" ones that haven't been detected. ""Few, if any, earthquakes in the seismic zone can be linked to named faults,"" according to the geological survey.

1742,"(CNN) -- More than 1,000 people are missing in the aftermath of a tropical storm that wreaked havoc across the southern Philippines last weekend, the country's government said Friday, as it grappled with the mounting humanitarian crisis in the region. A total of 1,079 people remain unaccounted for, the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said in a statement. Earlier in the week, the disaster council said it had lost count of the number of missing as it tried to assess the scale of the destruction. The death toll from Tropical Storm Washi, which set off landslides and flash floods that swept away whole villages, has risen to 1,080, according to the council. The United Nations said Wednesday that the storm has created ""huge"" humanitarian needs on the island of Mindanao, the scene of the worst devastation. It has made an appeal to raise $28 million to deal with the immediate problems in the area, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced in and around the port cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro. ""I was shocked by scale of destruction I saw,"" David Carden, the head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Philippines told CNN on Thursday after visiting the region. He said it looked as if an ""inland tsunami had struck the area."" Around 675,000 people have been affected by the storm, the disaster council said Friday, with more than 300,000 of them being taken care of at evacuation centers at the moment. President Benigno Aquino of the Philippines has declared a state of national calamity following the storm. The disaster council said it estimated the cost of the damage caused by the storm at more than one billion Philippines pesos ($23 million).","A total of 1,079 people remain unaccounted for after Tropical Storm Washi, the government says .

1743,"London (CNN) -- Heavy snow in recent weeks has already wreaked havoc across Europe -- now it is damaging some of the continent's most recognized historic monuments. The Colosseum in Rome has been forced to shut after small pieces of its walls crumbled away as a result of freezing temperatures. And buildings in the historic walled town of Urbino -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site -- are reported to be at risk of collapse under the weight of snow, following unprecedented blizzards in the area. In the Italian capital, thousands of tourists have been disappointed to discover the Colosseum, one of the city's most popular attractions, is closed to visitors, while checks are carried out to determine the extent of the damage and to help prevent further movement. Rossella Rea, archaeologist and superintendent of the Colosseum, told CNN: ""Tests and evaluation of the damage is still ongoing, especially on the second level of arches."" Rea said the enforced closure of the site would have a serious financial impact -- the Colosseum attracts some 7,000 visitors a day, paying 12 euros for a ticket -- but that it was necessary in the circumstances. ""At the weekend, some of the tourists didn't understand why the Colosseum was closed -- for people from northern countries, the snow is not a problem. ""But it's very unusual for us and it caused the detachment of dust, concrete and bricks. Little quantities but if they fall from a certain height they can be dangerous."" Cristiano Brughitta, spokesman for Italy's Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities, said the damage was caused by ice forming on the walls of the monument. ""When the temperatures drop below zero, and there is rain and snow, it causes ice to form which, with the increase in volume, pushes the external plaster masonry and causes small pieces to fall off,"" he said. David Pickles, senior architect at English Heritage, told CNN such damage was an extreme version of the natural wear and tear buildings face during everyday weather. ""There's a whole freeze/thaw cycle of damage to buildings where moisture gets into the stonework, into the pores of the stone, it then freezes and expands very significantly, it then breaks up the stone and then when it thaws, bits of stone will start falling off. ""That's happening all the time, of course, that's one of the major decay mechanisms in historic buildings anyway, because they're largely water permeable... You can't treat stone to stop it happening."" In Urbino, in the Marche region of Italy, partial collapses have been reported at the convents of San Francesco and San Bernardino, while the roof of the Church of the Capuchins outside the town center has reportedly caved in. The town's Duomo (cathedral) is also shut, because of water damage. Checks are being carried out on vulnerable buildings in the area. ""Our biggest worry is the buildings in the historic center, which have wooden joists and delicate roofs,"" said Gabriele Cavalera, a spokesperson for the local council. According to Cavalera, residents of some private homes in the historic center are adding extra support to the old roof beams in an attempt to prevent any further cave-ins. ""It's an enormous quantity of snow compared with what we normally get in winter and it's had a heavy impact, the equivalent of a flood,"" said Cavalera. Brughitta agreed that conditions were exceptional: ""Maybe every 30 years it gets this cold, but it's very rare."" A number of Italy's historic monuments, including the Colosseum and Pompeii, have suffered in recent years from damage and collapse. The Colosseum, which is scheduled to reopen to the public Thursday, is due to undergo restoration works later this year with sponsorship from luxury brand Tod's. In case of similar snowfalls in the future, Brughitta in Rome suggests using a type of cold-weather ""blanket"" for exposed monuments such as the nearly 2,000-year-old Colosseum. Though Pickles said such plans may be difficult, on a practical level: ""For a building like the Colosseum, I should think it would cost a fortune to cover it, because we're talking about a huge wall area."" And while delicate, these buildings are nonetheless tenacious when it comes to adverse weather and acts of god. After all, said Cavalera, The Ducal Palace in Urbino, which is around 500 years old and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, managed to resist collapse during the earthquakes of the 1990s and is so far holding out against the snow. Livia Borghese in Rome contributed to this report.","Snow has caused damage to the Colosseum in Rome and to historic buildings in Urbino .

1744,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck early Wednesday off the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, the U.S. Geological Survey reported, but witnesses reported only minor shaking on land. The quake was centered in the northern Indian Ocean, more than 400 km (250 miles) off northern Sumatra and more than 29 km (18 miles) beneath the surface. Indonesian authorities initially issued a tsunami warning for the area, before lifting it a couple of hours after the first quake struck. The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no threat of a massive wave like the one that devastated the region in 2004. The quake hit at 12:37 a.m. Wednesday (1:37 p.m. Tuesday ET), according to the USGS. There were no immediate reports of damage, and hotel clerks contacted by CNN reported only mild shaking. One front desk clerk in Aceh said a few hotel guests went outside when the quake hit, but most weren't awakened. The region is highly active seismically, and a magnitude 9.1 quake in December 2004 generated a tsunami that killed people as far away as eastern Africa. The death toll from the combined disaster topped 280,000 in a dozen countries, most of them in Indonesia. CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","NEW: Indonesian authorities lift tsunami warning .

1745,"(CNN) -- From the tsunami in Japan to famine in East Africa to the deadly tornado outbreaks in the United States, 2011 has been a historic year for natural disasters. A dozen weather-related disasters in the United States alone have caused more than $1 billion in damages each, breaking the record of nine billion-dollar disasters set in 2008, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Altogether, the damage from these events exceeds $50 billion. ""In many ways, 2011 rewrote the record books. From crippling snowstorms to the second deadliest tornado year on record to epic floods, drought and heat, and the third busiest hurricane season on record, we've witnessed the extreme of nearly every weather category,"" said NOAA spokesman Christopher Vaccaro. Dynamic 2011 events to shape world for years to come . Relief organizations have been working year-round to provide emergency aid when disaster strikes and long-term assistance in the months and years that follow. Oftentimes, help is needed long after the media attention subsides. ""Recovery is a very long process. People are so grateful for that temporary place to stay, that hot meal,"" said Jeff Jellets, territorial disaster coordinator for The Salvation Army. ""But we really look at how we can restore families back to their predisaster condition. ""Until those communities are rebuilt, the job just isn't done."" This year, there have been more than 1,000 weather-related fatalities in the United States, according to NOAA. Many of those occurred when deadly tornadoes ripped through the Southeast and Midwest this spring and summer. Vote for the top stories of 2011 . In late April, an estimated 343 tornadoes ripped through central and Southern states, killing 321 people, 240 of which were in Alabama. Tuscaloosa, Alabama, was particularly devastated. Then, less than a month later, 160 people were killed when a tornado with 200 mph winds struck Joplin, Missouri, making it the deadliest single tornado to strike the United States since modern tornado record-keeping began. Months later, many of these communities are still in need. ""People are starting the process of rebuilding, so we're helping them with things like appliances and rebuilding materials so they can get back in their homes,"" Jellets said. ""But then there are a number of people in places like Hackleburg, Alabama, which was really significantly damaged by a tornado, where people are still in the emergency assistance phase."" In August, Hurricane Irene made landfall over coastal North Carolina and headed north, killing 45 people and causing torrential rainfall and flooding across the Northeast. ""The real damage was inland flooding, particularly in places like upstate New York and Vermont. The Salvation Army still has distribution centers where we're handing out cleaning supplies and food boxes,"" Jellets said. ""But some of those communities were away from the media spotlight. What we can do is going to be very difficult over the long haul unless more donations come in for those events."" The American Red Cross has responded to 131 disaster relief operations in 44 separate states so far this year. ""We opened more than 1,000 shelters across the nation for disasters such as Hurricane Irene and the tornadoes,"" said Laura Howe, American Red Cross spokesperson. ""That's in comparison to 37 shelters that we opened across the nation in 2010."" Outside the United States, there have been several major disasters, including the massive earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the ensuing nuclear catastrophe, famine in East Africa and flooding in Thailand. The American Red Cross and other U.S.-based aid organizations joined international efforts to help Japan after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami killed 15,840 people, according to the most recent death toll, and set off a nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. ""A lot of the donations the American Red Cross has provided are supporting the rebuilding of hospitals and medical centers and providing social welfare programs for elderly and children,"" Howe said. ""Any time you have a large disaster, the recovery process is going to take a number of years."" The Salvation Army is helping Japanese fishermen get back to work. ""Just recently we provided funding to help many of the fishermen there get their boats and their wares back together so they can get back to the business that they know, which is commercial fishing,"" said Salvation Army spokesman Maj. George Hood. In the Horn of Africa, some regions are slowly recovering five months after the United Nations declared a famine in much of Somalia. The disaster has killed tens of thousands of people and 250,000 are still at risk of starvation. The World Food Programme is aiming to feed 11 million people in East Africa. The organization is currently reaching almost 8 million. ""It's crucially important that especially the children and nursing mothers get highly fortified supplementary foods. For $10 you can feed a woman or a child for three weeks,"" said WFP spokeswoman Bettina Luescher. ""Hunger is the biggest solvable global problem we have. For very little, you really can help change a life."" Ways to help . As relief organizations continue to provide aid to victims around the world, here are a few ways you can help.

1746,"(CNN) -- As many as 32 tourists who were trapped in South Africa's Kruger National Park after torrential rains and flooding have been rescued, park officials said Thursday. At least 70 other tourists, including Italians and Britons, and 10 staff members who were trapped in the rising waters had already been evacuated from washed-away cars and flooded camps at the safari destination, the officials said. David Mabunda, the chief executive of South African National Parks, flew over the park Thursday to witness the extent of the damage. He says there were no serious injuries and no people or animals were killed. The most serious damage was to the infrastructure. ""Roads, bridges, culverts, water supply pumps have been washed away. Barring a few tents, there has been limited damage to the tourism facilities,"" he said. At least 1,800 people are believed to have been in the park when the rain and flooding began Monday. The park has been declared 80% operational and the repair work is expected to take less than six months to complete. ""The sun is shining now. The main roads are still accessible and that is where most of the highlights are, so people must continue to come to the park,"" Mabunda told CNN. This is not the first time the Kruger, as it is popularly known, has been hit by floods. It took 10 months to repair the damage caused by rains in 2000. Mabunda says this time, disaster management was more prepared and so were the park's buildings. ""Our tourism facilities stood the test of the floods. The embankments and walls withstood the impact. The only problem we have now is water supply to the camps, which is a problem we are working on. We are also limiting day visitors in order to cope better."" Visitors already in the park were ""urged to exercise caution around rivers as crocodiles are likely to be in flat areas,"" according to a statement on the South African National Parks website. The park plans to ask the government to help cover some of the repair costs. Kruger National Park, South Africa's flagship big-game park and a top destination of foreign tourists, was established in 1898. It covers more than 7,500 square miles and boasts hundreds of animal and plant species, according to the National Parks' website.","NEW: 32 trapped tourists were rescued at the park Thursday .

1747,"(CNN) -- A body pulled from a Wisconsin river has been identified as the son of Green Bay Packers offensive coordinator Joe Philbin, police said Tuesday. Michael Philbin, 21, went missing early Sunday while in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to visit friends, police said. No cause of death was immediately determined, and an autopsy was set for Tuesday, Oshkosh Police Chief Scott Greuel said at a news conference. ""We love Michael so much and will miss him dearly,"" Joe Philbin said in a statement released Tuesday afternoon. ""He loved his family, friends and life. His memory will live on in the hearts and minds of all who knew him."" Philbin thanked the agencies that assisted in the search for his son, and expressed gratitude for ""the prayers and the support of our family, friends and the Packers family."" On behalf of the team, Packers General Manager Ted Thompson said everyone's thoughts and prayers were with the family. ""This is an emotional and difficult time for them, and we ask that everyone respect their privacy,"" he said. ""All of us in the Packers family share in their grief."" The body was found Monday in the Fox River after Oshkosh police put out an alert asking citizens for help in locating Philbin, who lived about 20 miles away in Ripon. His last known communication was at 2 a.m. Sunday, police said. ""He talked to a friend. He didn't sound like he was under duress or he had any medical condition,"" police spokesman Joe Nichols told CNN affiliate WTMJ Monday. ""The phone conversation ended, and that was the last time someone had voice contact."" Michael Philbin was the second-eldest of six children of Joe Philbin and his wife, Diane, according to the Packers' website. His funeral is set for Friday. His father coached for 19 years at college football programs before coming to Green Bay in 2003 as an assistant offensive line coach. He became the team's offensive coordinator in 2007 and played a significant part in the Packers' league-best 15-1 regular season record this season.

Authorities said no one was injured when the beams -- each weighing several tons -- came hurtling down from one of the new towers being built at the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""The cable of a crane broke, causing the steel it was lifting to fall approximately 40 stories back onto the flatbed truck that had transported the steel into the World Trade Center site,"" said a statement from John Gallagher, spokesman for Tishman Construction, which manages the site. ""The incident occurred within an enclosed section of the site, which is not accessible to the public."" The 72-story building, which will face the World Trade Center memorial park honoring the victims of 9/11, is scheduled to officially open in the fall of 2013, according to the World Trade Center website. ""Fortunately... nobody was hurt,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference Thursday. Gallagher said in his statement that the construction company was ""investigating the matter in full cooperation"" with authorities including the New York fire department, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the city's Department of Buildings. ""The job is partially shut down pending the investigation,"" Gallagher said.","Three steel beams fall after a crane cable snaps .

1749,"(CNN) -- As plans for the weekend funeral of singer Whitney Houston took shape, investigators continued Thursday to look into the singer's prescription drugs and her actions in the days before her death. Investigators are aware of Houston's partying at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, and other venues ""even the night before she died,"" a source close to the death investigation told CNN's Don Lemon on Thursday. Hotel personnel have said Houston, 48, was ""partying the night before her death in the bar,"" the source said. Investigators are looking at video from Houston's television appearances and other reports as part of the investigation into her physical state and behavior leading up to her death, the source said. Houston died Saturday on the eve of the Grammy Awards. Hotel surveillance video could reveal Houston's activities in the common areas of the hotel, the source said. The source would not confirm such video exists, but said investigators have requested it. The anti-anxiety medication Xanax was among prescription drugs found in the room, the source said. Houston's family members and staff confirmed she used the medication, the source said, but investigators don't know whether she took it the day she died. No Valium or other drugs classified as benzodiazepines, or sedatives, were found in the room, according to the source. Houston also had a prescription for the antibiotic amoxicillin, the source said, but ""if taken as prescribed, it's not going to kill you."" Medicine and pill bottles found in Houston's hotel room are currently undergoing basic testing, but nothing so far indicates anything criminal occurred, the source said. Officials are trying to speed up toxicology testing, the source told CNN. The source also said any preliminary reporting that family members were told a deadly mixture of alcohol and drugs led to Houston's death is speculative. Investigators do not know what mixture, if any Houston, had in her body. When paramedics arrived in Houston's hotel suite, she was in the room, not in the bathroom, the source said. ""She was lying on the floor, wet, on her back"" and had already been removed from the bathtub, according to the source. ""No one official ever saw her in the bathtub or the bathroom,"" the source said. ""The assistant and a bodyguard reported to emergency personnel that Houston was removed from the tub."" Her body was initially discovered by her assistant, Mary Jones, who was often called ""Aunt Mary,"" a family source said earlier this week. The source said investigators have contacted physicians and pharmacies around the country for information. The Mickey Fine Pharmacy and Grill in Beverly Hills was one of the pharmacies subpoenaed, the source said. The pharmacy did nothing criminal and is not the focus of the investigation, the source said. One of the prescriptions found in Houston's suite was from Mickey Fine, according to Ed Winter, assistant chief coroner at the Los Angeles County Coroner's office. But ""the prescription that came from Mickey Fine is not something that would kill her,"" Winter has said. Mickey Fine is ""getting a bad rap from some in the media as if they're the ones doling out prescriptions,"" the source told CNN. ""They're actually the good guys and have been extremely cooperative with the investigation."" Winter has said that while prescription medication was found in Houston's room, the amount was less than that usually present in overdose deaths. A second source, briefed on Houston's behavior and activity in the days before her death, said she was seen ordering and consuming considerable quantities of alcohol at the hotel two mornings last week. Houston ordered the drinks before 10 a.m. last Wednesday and Thursday from the bars in the lobby and pool area, the second source said Wednesday. Guests both days overheard Houston loudly complaining about her drinks, accusing bartenders of ""watering down"" or ""putting too much ice"" in them, the source said. Other guests expressed concern about Houston's erratic behavior, according to the source. Her disheveled appearance, including mismatched clothing, suggested to them that she was intoxicated. The source said Houston was seen jumping in and out of the pool and doing somersaults in the pool area. Saturday, the day she died, Houston was seen drinking at the pool in the morning, although the source noted witnesses said her behavior did not appear erratic. Houston's death certificate, filed Wednesday, listed her cause of death as ""deferred,"" meaning a determination is delayed pending more information. Speculation has grown while authorities await the outcome of toxicology tests that could take weeks. ""I know there are reports that she maybe was drowned or did she overdose, but we won't make a final determination until all the tests are in,"" Winter said earlier. He ruled out foul play and said there were no injuries to Houston's body. Houston's battles with drug addiction had cast a shadow in recent years over her impressive singing voice and her talent. However, a close family friend told CNN Tuesday that Houston had not used ""hard drugs"" for several years, although she was taking medication for a throat infection and Xanax or a similar drug for anxiety and to help her sleep. The friend said Houston was also known to have a drink if she went out. In Newark, New Jersey, fans left balloons, candles and photographs of the singer in front of the church where her funeral will take place Saturday. At New Hope Baptist Church, the Newark house of worship where Houston sang as a child, preparations were under way for the private, invitation-only service. Actor Kevin Costner, who starred with Houston in the 1992 hit movie ""The Bodyguard,"" will speak at her funeral, according to a source with knowledge of the funeral plans. The ceremony will feature performances by Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys and Aretha Franklin, who is Houston's godmother, a Houston representative said. Singer Roberta Flack will attend, but it was not known Thursday whether she would perform. Houston's former husband, Bobby Brown will attend and perform later in the day with his group New Edition. Brown considers performing as therapy to get him through a difficult time, a source close to him said. Houston's funeral will be broadcast Saturday . Samuel DiMaio, Newark police director, told reporters Thursday his advice to fans and curious members of the public was to stay home and watch the ceremony on television, as they will not be able to get close to the church. The service is expected to be made available for television and web streaming, Houston's publicist said. A perimeter will be set up for four blocks in two directions, and two blocks in the other directions, DiMaio said. The closest the public will be able to get is a staging area two blocks away. Although the family is not commenting on Houston's burial location, her death certificate filed Wednesday in Los Angeles lists it as Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, New Jersey. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced earlier this week that he plans to have the state's flags fly at half-staff on Friday. Since then, Christie has been standing ground against critics who disagree with his choice to use a tribute typically used to honor fallen soldiers or first responders. One Twitter user weighed in, ""Our flag is to be used to honor true American heroes, the ones you just disrespected."" To that response, Christie seemed to agree to disagree. ""Many in the state are mourning the loss of a cultural icon in NJ's history,"" he wrote. ""We are recognizing her for those contributions."" Educators and Houston friends in East Orange, New Jersey, where Houston attended school. are firm in the their recollections. ""She was a beautiful little girl, very quiet,"" said Henry Hamilton, who was Houston's principal while she was at Franklin Elementary School. ""She was well-respected and never came to the office for discipline problems."" The school is now called the Whitney E. Houston Academy of Creative and Performing Arts. Childhood friend Erica Taylor said the Houston residence was popular in the summertime: It was the only one to have a built-in swimming pool. ""We would talk about boys and what we were doing over the summer and how it was just fun to be in the pool,"" said Taylor. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Kareen Wynter, Ross Levitt, Gary Tuchman, Stan Wilson, Alan Duke, Denise Quan and Deb Feyerick contributed to this report.","Investigators trying to speed up toxicology results, source says .

1750,"Tegucigalpa, Honduras (CNN) -- The death toll from a prison fire in central Honduras rose to 382 Thursday, as new details emerged about what happened when flames tore through the overcrowded facility. Officials transported bodies from the prison in Comayagua to the capital, Tegucigalpa, where investigators worked to identify the victims. The cause of the fire remained unknown, and the federal government asked for patience during its inquiry. But desperate families said they didn't want to wait to recover the remains of their loved ones. ""What we are hoping for is that they give them to us so we can leave because we cannot stand the hunger, too,"" said Francisca Gomez, the sister of one of the victims. ""We have our children with us and you know that we've been here waiting and no one gives us answers."" The Comayagua fire department gave the new death toll, and said that it remained unknown if others escaped or would be added to the casualty list. The hypothesis that a mattress fire started the blaze was gaining traction, fire operations chief Jorge Turcios said Thursday. Comayagua's governor said she received a call from an inmate inside the prison reporting the fire. ""What I know, according to what I've been told, is that someone lit a mattress on fire and said, 'We're all going to die,'"" Gov. Paola Castro said. Inmates have also complained that guards were slow to open doors for them to escape. Prisoners broke out of the facility any way they could, one survivor said. ""The authorities should have opened the gates,"" said Odalis Aleyda Najera, a relative of a victim. ""It is preferable to face the responsibility for a mass escape of prisoners and avoid situations like this where there are more than 300 dead inmates."" Outrage over the fire increased after the president of the country's supreme court admitted that only 40% of the inmates in the prison had been convicted. The majority were awaiting trial or waiting for charges to be filed against them. ""Honduras passed an anti-gang law, and what it allowed police to do is to sweep anybody off the streets ... who they had a suspicion was a member of a gang, but really had no proof. So the prison population swelled,"" said Vikki Gass of the Washington Office on Latin America. ""And so in the case of Comayagua, you don't have enough magistrates or judges to process the people who are being detained."" Authorities have not determined what caused the fire, but the nation's electric utility will review wiring in all prison facilities as a ""preventative measure,"" Honduran President Porfirio Lobo said, ""because that can be one of the causes of these types of disasters."" The prison facility was well over capacity, said Rodrigo Escobar Gil of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. ""The prisoners slept on the floor and they had to share cells in truly deplorable conditions,"" he said. At the request of Honduran officials, arson experts from the United States were expected to arrive in Honduras Thursday to lend a hand, Turcios said. The team from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) will reconstruct the scene, conduct interviews and sift through debris to obtain evidence and determine the origin of the blaze, the agency said in a statement. Teams from El Salvador, Chile and Mexico were also expected to help Honduran authorities. Tuesday night's blaze was the third fatal prison fire in recent years in the country. In 2003, 61 prisoners were killed in a fire at a prison in La Ceiba. In 2004, 107 died in a fire at a San Pedro Sula prison. The U.S. State Department published a report last April criticizing conditions at Honduras' 24 prisons. Prisoners ""suffered from severe overcrowding, malnutrition, and lack of adequate sanitation,"" the report said, citing human rights groups. CNN's Carol Cratty, Brooke Baldwin and Camilo Egana contributed to this report.","NEW: A team from the ATF will help investigate the blaze .

1751,"(CNN) -- Scores of emergency personnel on Thursday helped battle a fire that burned a docked Russian nuclear submarine, state media reported. Wooden scaffolding caught fire Thursday afternoon at a repair dock in Roslyakovo, which is in the Murmansk region in northwest Russia along the Barents Sea, the official Itar-Tass and RIA-Novosti news agencies reported. The flames spread to hull of the nuclear submarine Yekaterinburg, where work had been underway. About 100 emergency personnel responded, using 40 pieces of firefighting and other equipment to spray foam and water to douse the blaze, the regional emergency ministry said according to Itar-Tass. Gov. Dmitry Dmitrienko said that the submarine's nuclear reactors were then shut down and there was no threat of radiation spreading, the news agency reported. Capt. Vadim Sega, a spokesman for Russia's northern fleet, added that the fire never penetrated the hull and got inside the ship. ""There is no possibility of fire burning through the hull, and no threat to on-board equipment,"" Sega said Thursday, according to RIA-Novosti. The emergency ministry said Thursday that there had been no injuries, reported this news agency. The nuclear sub, itself, was partially submerged to minimize damage. The fire continued into Friday despite initial reports it had been extinguished, Itar-Tass reported. By 1:40 a.m., (4:40 p.m. ET Thursday), the blaze had been ""localized,"" Russian Emergency Minister Sergei Shoigu said. One of seven Delta-IV class submarines in operation, the Yekaterinburg carries 16 ballistic missiles. According to the military research website RusNavy.com, the vessel was launched in September 1984, has two nuclear reactors and can carry a 140-person crew.","Scaffolding caught fire on a dock in northwest Russia, state media reports .

1752,"(CNN) -- The World Health Organization on Friday reported 2,500 confirmed cases of swine flu in 25 countries, with 44 deaths from the disease. A researcher investigates swine flu at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. In the United States, the total number of confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus, as swine flu is officially called, nearly doubled to 1,639 from the day before, with reports coming from 43 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The U.S. Navy said Friday that 12 crew members aboard the USS Dubuque have been diagnosed with swine flu. The amphibious transport dock ship had been due to deploy on June 1 to the South Pacific on a humanitarian mission, Cmdr. Joseph Surette, a Navy spokesman, said Tuesday. The ship was being scrubbed and disinfected, and its remaining 370 crew members were given Tamiflu as a precaution, Surette said. Navy officials said the ship could still be deployed in an emergency, but would remain in port in San Diego, California, until commanders determine the crew is suitable to deploy. Dr. Sylvie Briand, acting director of the Global Influenza Program for the World Health Organization, said the agency will remain at pandemic alert level 5 -- one step away from its highest level -- because while there are an increasing number of cases, there is no evidence of the community transmission outside North America that would push the alert to level 6. Of the 44 deaths reported, two were in the United States and 42 in Mexico, which has the highest concentration of swine flu cases, with more than 1,100. President Obama, speaking on the H1N1 virus during a town hall meeting for Latinos, said Americans should continue to take basic precautions such as frequently washing their hands. He also said the country should prepare for a particularly tough flu season this fall. ""The virus may not have been as virulent as we once feared, but we're not out of the woods yet,"" Obama said. Briand of WHO said many of the new cases being reported are imported -- returning travelers bringing them into their countries -- and cases resulting from close contact with those already infected, such as family members. Meanwhile, Britain's health secretary announced Friday that his country's Health Protection Agency has sequenced the full genetic code of the H1N1 virus, the first step in producing a European prototype of a swine flu vaccine. ""This is critical in understanding how the virus operates and identifying the crucial parts of the virus that can be used in vaccine manufacture,"" said a statement from the agency.

1753,"(CNN) -- The company that inspected a Colorado cantaloupe farm at the center of a deadly listeriosis outbreak ignored federal regulators' ""best and most timely"" advice on processing produce, a congressional committee has found. The FDA cited ""serious design flaws"" and a ""lack of awareness"" of safety standards at Jensen Farms as the likely sources of the bacterial contamination behind the deaths. But in a report issued this week, congressional investigators found the company that conducted a July safety audit at the farm, Bio Food Safety, gave it near-perfect marks despite finding three ""major deficiencies."" In particular, it noted that the company washed its cantaloupe in water that was not treated with chlorine or any other anti-bacterial additive -- a process the FDA said was inconsistent with its recommendations and ""a probable cause of the contamination."" The inspector did not take points off for the finding, the report states. ""The guidance which Bio Food Safety did not consider in its audit represents the agency's best and most timely advice on how processing should be handled,"" the House Energy and Commerce Committee concluded in its bipartisan report. The September outbreak killed 30 people, triggered a miscarriage in one woman and sickened more than 115 others -- the deadliest outbreak of foodborne illness in more than a quarter-century, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What is listeria monocytogenes? Bio Food Safety President Jerry Walzel declined comment on the report Wednesday, citing a pending lawsuit. But he told committee investigators that his company followed FDA regulations, and the agency's guidelines are ""opinions."" ""We are not supposed to be opinionated on this,"" the report quotes Walzel. ""We are supposed to go by FDA's regulations ... FDA should have mandated that you cannot sell cantaloupes that have not been sanitized."" The report states that in 2010, Walzel recommended Jensen Farms replace a water cooler used to chill the fruit before packaging, citing it as a potential safety ""hot spot."" The owners replaced the device in 2011, buying equipment that had been used in a potato plant and refitting it. In October, the FDA found that equipment ""did not lend itself to be easily or routinely cleaned and sanitized,"" allowing dirt to build up. It also criticized Jensen Farms for allowing water to pool on the floor of the packing facility: samples of that water tested positive for the bacteria behind the outbreak. Jensen Farms had not returned a phone call seeking comment Wednesday afternoon. The FDA does not regulate private auditors such as Bio Food Safety, a subcontractor for the company Jensen Farms hired to conduct inspections. Under a law passed in 2011, the agency is required to set up an accreditation system and set standards for those firms.","The September listeria outbreak killed 30 people .

1754,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A 24-year-old man was charged Monday with arson in connection with a rash of car and building fires across the Los Angeles area, authorities said. Harry Burkhart was charged with one count of arson of an inhabited dwelling and will likely face additional charges as the investigation moves forward, said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Arson investigators counted 52 fires, most starting in parked cars, since Friday morning, but none since the man was was detained at 3 a.m. Monday, according to officials. Burkhart is currently being held without bail. ""These were serious and potentially deadly crimes that needlessly endangered thousands of innocent lives,"" Villaraigosa told reporters. ""These crimes will not be tolerated."" Burkhart is believed to a foreign national from Germany, according to Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck. Authorities hope, and believe one arsonist acted alone, but will behave as though he did not until they know for sure, Beck said. Burkhart's arrest came when a sheriff's deputy stopped a van near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood early Monday, said Los Angeles Fire Capt. Jaime Moore. The van matched the description of a vehicle believed related to some of the suspicious fires and the driver resembled a man seen in a surveillance video near the scene of one fire, he said. The video showed a man who appears to be in his late 20s to mid-30s, with a ponytail, dark hair and a receding hairline. No one was killed or seriously injured in the fires, though one firefighter and one civilian sustained minor injuries, said Los Angeles City Fire Chief Brian Cummings. Both he and the mayor estimated the fires caused some $3 million in damages. Among the homes damaged was one that was once occupied by the Doors frontman Jim Morrison. Eleven of the fires took place overnight, in the very early hours of Monday: nine within the city of Los Angeles and two in West Hollywood, fire department spokesman Cecco Secci said. Cars were set on fire in Hollywood and Van Nuys, Moore said. Los Angeles has not seen such a rash of fires since the city's riots in 1992. CNN's Irving Last, Josh Levs, Drew Griffin, Stan Wilson and Casey Wian contributed to this report.","Authorities believe the suspect is a foreign national from Germany .

1755,"(CNN) -- For the residents of Christchurch, New Zealand, time stopped at 12.51pm on February 22, 2011, when a massive earthquake ripped through the city, destroying homes, lives and businesses. One year on, reminders are never too far away, from the broken buildings to frequent aftershocks that rattle the city every day. Some are too minor to feel; others cause a sharp intake of breath. ""February, 22, 2011... is a date permanently etched into all of our minds, a date that will go down in the history of New Zealand as one of our darkest days,"" Prime Minister John Key told crowds gathered for a civic memorial service in the city Wednesday. The magnitude 6.3 quake shook the city for a matter of seconds, but it was long enough to kill 185 people from 14 countries. Many more were injured. The tremor brought down buildings in the city center in the middle of the working day, trapping workers and triggering a national state of emergency as rescuers scrambled to save lives. Most of the victims -- 115 -- were buried in the rubble of the Canterbury Television (CTV) building, which was later found by a government report to have been poorly constructed. One survivor, Anne Vos, spoke to the media by cellphone as she lay trapped under her desk in the rubble of the five-story Pyne Gould Corporation building. After being pulled out, 24 hours later, she told CNN, ""I was finding it hard to breathe, and I really thought that was it for me. I thought 'this is it - I'm not coming out of here.'"" Anne Vos: A survivor's story . One year later, Christchurch remains locked in recovery mode, a city carved into zones labeled by color to indicate the severity of the earthquake damage to homes and land. For residents in the red zone, there is no future there. Around 6,800 homes, many clustered along the Avon River, have been designated for destruction. The government says around 46% of residents in the red zone have accepted its offer to buy their land. Some have cut their ties with the area; others are still wading through insurance claims on homes waiting to be destroyed. Before the quake, 22-year-old desktop publisher Sarah Boyd lived with her partner in Avonside, a small suburb that has now been condemned. ""It was a tiny wee suburb and nearly every house there has gone,"" she said. ""They said that our house was sinking towards the river. They reckon all land would travel towards the river."" They moved out of the red zone in November, but Boyd said their new home suffered damage during the February quake and subsequent aftershocks, and may also need to be demolished. Boyd works at the office at the Catholic Diocese of Christchurch, which suffered a blow during the quake with the near collapse of the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. It is currently being propped up with shipping containers while work continues to determine exactly how much of the building can be saved. The brightly-colored containers can been seen dotted through the city, at the makeshift ""Re:Start"" mall in the city center and along roads below unstable cliffs considered to be at risk of landslide. ""It's a city of two parts really,"" said Matt O'Connell, the earthquake recovery coordinator for the Catholic Diocese, who works in the same office as Boyd. Last week he took part in an Ecumenical door-knocking team made up of representatives from varying faiths in the city. ""Even just on one street we met a family there who are struggling for food who had eight to ten people living in a two-bedroom house,"" he said. ""A lot of people are tired, stressed and frustrated. The rebuild seems to be going relatively slowly. There are lots of issues."" Recovery efforts are being hampered by frequent aftershocks. The February 22 quake was one itself, after a larger, magnitude 7.1 quake the previous September. That one ran deeper so caused less damage. The government said there have been 10,000 quakes since last September, including 39 of a magnitude of five or greater. ""We had a really good run from June until December the 23rd, then we got hit with a magnitude six quake, two days before Christmas. It really, really set people back. There was further damage, no one was injured, but it was a psychological blow for many people,"" O'Connell said. While people struggle to recover, work continues to rebuild shattered buildings and infrastructure. Prime Minister Key has said the recovery plan is making ""good progress."" Construction has started on 26 ""significant"" commercial buildings in the city center. Work on 80% of the 1,406 buildings marked for partial or full demolition has been completed. And 200 infrastructure repair projects are now underway, he said. ""Long term Christchurch will look much different but it will be vibrant, new and a great place to live,"" Key added. Thousands have not stayed around to find out. Population figures released in October, the first numbers made public since the quake, showed more than 10,000 people had left the city in the year to June 2011. On the eve of the anniversary, the city buried the unidentified remains of four people who were killed in the quake in a new cemetery. It will be one of the more somber reminders of that day. The city came to a halt for two minutes at 12.51 local time, as residents paid their respects to those who were killed. Tomorrow they'll get back to the long, drawn-out task of rebuilding their lives and moving forward.","Magnitude 6.3 quake shook city on February 22, 2011 .

1756,"(CNN) -- A bullet thought to have been from a shootout between carjackers and municipal police in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, struck a woman walking in neighboring El Paso, Texas, Tuesday morning, El Paso's mayor told CNN. The still unidentified woman, 48, was shot in the lower leg; her injuries were not considered life-threatening. El Paso Mayor John Cook said local police investigating the incident had not officially confirmed that the bullet came from Juarez, but they were ""treating it as if it did,"" he said. ""It's still matter of speculation,"" he added. ""Early on, it became evident this may have been a stray bullet rather than a targeted shooting in downtown,"" local police said in a press release. ""The El Paso Police Department continues its investigation and is working closely with its counterparts in Mexico."" If the bullet did in fact come from Mexico, this is ""the first time a person has been hit"" in the 3Â½ year since drug-fueled violence escalated in neighboring Juarez, Cook added. In Juarez, a shootout between suspected carjackers and the municipal police happened around 11 a.m. (1 p.m. ET), about the same time the woman was shot, according to municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez. He was unaware of any connection between that shooting and the incident in El Paso. ""We have an office that works with the U.S. and so far we have not received a report from them saying the two incidents were connected,"" he added. El Paso police said that while they were responding to the shooting, the El Paso 911 center ""received numerous calls advising of shots fired near the border in Juarez, Mexico."" Just about a mile separates downtown El Paso from Juarez. ""Under the right circumstances there is a possibility that a round fired from an AK-type weapon could travel that far, conceivably,"" Mike Brooks, HLN Law Enforcement analyst told CNN. ""It depends on what kind of round it is and how heavy the round is."" ""We're advising the citizens of El Paso that this is an isolated incident. We don't want people to start panicking,"" he said. At least four schools in El Paso went on lockdown shortly after the woman was reported being shot. ""We were alerted by local police about concerns in the area,"" Estela Reyes, the press officer for the La Fe Preparatory School, told CNN. ""We were in lockdown by 11:30 a.m. and lifted it about 30 minutes later. The kids were never in any imminent danger,"" she said. Reyes said her school is about ""seven or eight blocks"" from downtown El Paso and she never heard gunfire from Juarez. In June 2010, the El Paso City Hall was struck by several rounds, which local police believe the shots may have come from a shooting in Juarez. About two months later, a similar incident occurred when a building at the University of Texas at El Paso was struck by a bullet. School officials believe that round also came from a shooting in Juarez.","A woman in downtown El Paso was struck in the leg by a bullet Tuesday .

1759,"(CNN) -- Victims and campaigners from the Bhopal disaster of 1984 have staged a ""die-in"" outside the UK's sports ministry to protest at the sponsorship role Dow Chemical Company will play in the London 2012 Olympics. The demonstrators object to the International Olympic Committee's 10-year deal with Dow, who in 2001 became owners of the firm that caused one of the worst industrial disasters in India, when nearly 4,000 people were killed by a gas leak at the Union Carbide plant. An estimated 45,000 others were said to be affected by the emission of poisonous gas at the site in Bhopal, which has caused cancer, disability and renal failure. The demonstrators want the Indian government to boycott the 2012 Games if the IOC keeps Dow as a sponsor, and said they will continue their protests after the Olympic body insisted their partner was not responsible for the tragedy. The campaigners are lobbying the UK government to rectify what it claims are ""transparent errors of moral judgment and legal reasoning"" in its failure to remove all support for Dow's sponsorship. India's government has written to the IOC to ask it to drop ties with Dow, while the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has threatened to withdraw from the Games if no action is taken. In a letter to the IOA, Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC, said: ""IOC recognizes that the Bhopal tragedy in 1984 was an horrific event for India and the world. ""The Olympic Movement sympathizes with the grief of the victims' families and regrets the ongoing suffering people face in the region. ""Dow had no connection with the Bhopal tragedy. Dow did not have any ownership stake in Union Carbide until 16 years after the accident and 12 years after the $470 million compensation agreement was approved by the Indian Supreme Court. ""We only enter into partnerships with organizations that we believe work in accordance with the values of the Olympic Movement."" But with the Indian Supreme Court reviewing the case for a third time, the protestors claimed Dow was engaged in an ""unethical refusal to deal with its unresolved legal and moral liabilities in Bhopal."" They also claimed Dow are misrepresenting facts and ""prolonging the suffering of thousands of people in Bhopal, including that of unborn generations."" Officials from the protest group met with representatives from the UK's high commission and handed over a petition complete with 21,000 signatures that asked for Dow to be dropped as an Olympic sponsor.","Indian group protest to UK government over sponsorship deal for London 2012 Games .

1760,"(CNN) -- Travelers across the United States arrived en masse at airports, hit the roads and boarded trains Wednesday, a day before the Thanksgiving holiday. ""It's actually surprisingly not as much of a disaster as I thought it was going to be,"" said Rafi Samuels-Schwartz, 25, who was waiting at New Jersey's Newark International Airport to board a plane to Minneapolis, Minnesota -- a flight that was on time, he added. ""It wasn't pandemonium, it wasn't a scene from 'Independence Day,' "" he said. ""I thought it was going to be considerably worse."" The number of people traveling this holiday weekend is expected to increase slightly, compared with last year, although the number traveling by air is expected to decline, according to the American Automobile Association, a motorist and traveler organization. The AAA, which surveyed 1,350 American households, projects that 38.4 million people will travel over the holiday weekend, up from 37.8 million last year. However, the number traveling by air is expected to decline to 2.3 million, the automobile association said. In 2008, 2.5 million people traveled by plane for Thanksgiving. See the FAA's flight delays map . AAA said the slight increase in the number of Thanksgiving travelers from last year reflects improved consumer confidence as well as ""a growing sense among many consumers that the worst of the global economic crisis is behind us."" Citing excess baggage fees and surcharges for jet fuel, along with delays and flight groundings, AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom said it's ""not a very friendly environment this decade for the airline industry or the airline traveler."" David Ross, who was at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, with his wife and four children to catch a flight to Cancun, Mexico, offered some advice. ""You have to be calm and collected when you come to this airport, especially on a day like today,"" Ross, from Libertyville, Illinois, told CNN affiliate WGN. However, by 1 p.m. ET, delays at the country's airports appeared to be minimal, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's Web site. It reported that some arriving flights at the airports in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Newark, New Jersey, and at LaGuardia Airport in New York were delayed because of low cloud ceilings. ""So far, so good,"" traveler Andy Warman told CNN affiliate WABC at LaGuardia Airport. ""My flight's on time, so I'm pretty happy about that,"" added Warman, who was headed to Miami, Florida, to see family. At Washington's Reagan National Airport, the morning lines seemed like those of any other day. ""It's deserted,"" one woman told CNN affiliate WJLA. ""There's nobody here."" Of course, the bulk of Thanksgiving travelers will be going by car, AAA said -- about 33.2 million. ""I'm going to probably end up sitting in traffic for five hours,"" said Jack DeManche, 21, a student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who plans on driving home Wednesday night to Uxbridge, Massachusetts. The drive is usually only about two hours from Amherst, but DeManche -- a resident adviser at the school -- won't be able to leave until he closes one of the student residence halls. ""I have to work until at least 6 p.m., and then I have to pack up,"" he said, adding that in years past, the drive has taken more than twice as long as it does on nonholiday weeks. But even so, he said, he'd rather brave the drive home Wednesday night than Thursday morning. ""I'd so much rather get home tonight,"" he said. In Oklahoma, the state's department of public safety said multiple accidents had shut down Interstate 35 in both directions around Billings. CNN affiliate KWTV said the closures occurred around 12:25 p.m. In California, an accident on the Golden Gate Bridge prompted authorities to close the bridge for a time, snarling traffic. The bridge reopened shortly after noon (3 p.m. ET), but Golden Gate Bridge District spokeswoman Mary Currie said the backup of traffic would take some time to clear. About 2.9 million people will travel by train, watercraft, bus or a combination of transportation modes, and 2.3 million will travel by air, the automobile association predicted. Jennifer Burrell, from Tucker, Georgia, said she, her husband and their two daughters were driving Thursday morning to just outside of Asheville, North Carolina. They'll return Sunday. She said she wasn't expecting traffic on the way up, but ""it always gets heavy"" on the way back. Of course, some Americans are not traveling at all. Heather McKinnon of Broomfield, Colorado, said she is staying home with family for Thanksgiving. ""I don't like to fly and really rarely like flying on holidays,"" she said, adding that she would consider driving. ""I know what it's like going through the airport,"" she said. Plus, she added, ""everything I love is here."" CNN's Taylor Gandossy and Augie Martin contributed to this report.","AAA predicts 38.4 million Americans will travel over the holiday weekend .

1761,"(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy rescued a survivor from an Iranian cargo vessel that sank in the Persian Gulf, killing at least three other crew members, the military said Sunday. It was the latest incident in a string of rescues since the beginning of the year, against a backdrop of high tensions between the United States and Iran. The coastal patrol boat USS Firebolt and the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Maui conducted a search and rescue mission for survivors of the capsized Iranian dhow -- a sailing vessel typically used to haul cargo -- on Saturday and Sunday, the Navy said in a statement. The Firebolt's crew also recovered the remains of three of those who had died in the sinking, the Navy said. One survivor was recovered and treated for shock and hypothermia. He said the dhow sank in bad weather Friday night with six mariners aboard. The sailor reported that four of his shipmates died and one was missing, according to the Navy. The U.S. ships searched for the possible survivor and the fourth body, in an effort that also included two Seahawk helicopters and the dock landing ship USS Pearl Harbor. But they could not find them, and ultimately ended the search due to bad weather, the Navy said. The Iranian mariner was transferred to the Maui, and then to an Iranian Coast Guard vessel. In January, U.S. sailors from a carrier strike group rescued 13 Iranian sailors from a hijacked fishing boat, and the U.S. Coast Guard rescued six Iranian mariners from a flooded vessel at the northern end of the Gulf.","The Iranian dhow sank in bad weather, a survivor tells the U.S. Navy .

1762,"(CNN) -- Tributes have flooded in for former West Indies Test player Runako Morton, who was killed in a car crash in Trinidad Sunday. The 33-year-old Morton played all three forms of international cricket for the West Indies, last representing them two years ago. Reports said he was driving home alone on his way home from a match when the tragic accident occurred in central Trinidad. West Indies Cricket Board president Dr Julian Hunte gave the official reaction to his death. ""Runako's passing, still in the prime of life, leaves us all in shock,"" he said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends as we all try to come to terms with his loss. ""He will be remembered as a fierce competitor on the field who gave no quarter whether he was playing for West Indies, Leeward Islands, Nevis or Trinidad and Tobago."" Former captain Chris Gayle tweeted: ""We lost a True Warrior WI Cricketer Runako Morton - May (h)is soul . rest in peace! While former teammate Wavell Hinds also used his Twitter blog to express his feelings. ""Gone far too soon brother Runako. I will treasure the great memories for sure. RIP. God knows best."" Morton, who hailed from the tiny island of Nevis, scored 573 Test runs at an average of 22.03 and 1519 in one day internationals (ODI) at 33.75. His Test debut came against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 2005, and he made his maiden ODI hundred against New Zealand a year later. But despite being an acknowledged talent, Morton was unable to cement a regular place in the West Indies team in any format. In other cricket news Monday, former New Zealand captain Chris Cairns has began his High Court action in London against former Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi. Cairns, 41, is suing Modi for substantial libel damages over an ""unequivocal allegation"" made on Twitter that he was involved in match-fixing. The disputed tweet was picked up and reported on the cricket website Cricinfo, but they were forced to remove it by Cairns and pay him damages. However Modi refused to apologize and pleaded justification, maintaining that the charge was true. The case, without a jury, is expected to last two weeks.","Former West Indies international Runako Morton killed in car crash .

1763,"(CNN) -- The heart of a 900-year-old saint has vanished from Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin, Ireland, police and the Cathedral said. St. Laurence O'Toole's heart was kept in a heart-shaped wooden box in a cage bolted to a wall in Saint Lauds Chapel, Irish police said. It disappeared between Friday evening and Saturday noon, police said. Adding to the mystery, there was no sign of a break-in or of damage, police told CNN. Nothing was taken from the chapel other than the heart, although Irish media said there were gold candesticks and other valuables there. Cathedral staff called the disappearance of the relic ""truly awful and strange"" and said they were ""shocked and saddened."" St. Laurence O'Toole was born in 1128, lived until 1180, and was made a saint in 1225, according to the Catholic Encyclopedia. Catholics often preserve body parts from saints, believing they should be venerated. When Pope John Paul II was declared ""blessed"" -- a step below sainthood -- last year, a vial of his blood was displayed as a relic.","The heart of St. Laurence O'Toole was kept in a box in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin .

1764,"(CNN) -- A series of explosions at an ammunition depot killed 200 people and wounded about 2,000 more in Brazzaville, the capital of Africa's Republic of Congo, Congolese officials said Monday. The explosions occurred shortly after 8 a.m. Sunday (2 a.m. ET) when a fire at the depot set off a cache of tank shells, said Betu Bangana, director of protocol for President Denis Sassou-Nguesso. Bangana said at least 200 people had been confirmed dead by Monday morning, and many bodies may be ""unfindable."" Ministry of Information press attache Bruno Impene said hospitals were overflowing, with the wounded lying in the corridors. The blasts destroyed numerous homes in the neighborhoods surrounding the installation, Bangana said. The force of the explosions broke windows up to 5 km (3 miles) away in Kinshasa, the capital of the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. The DRC's military responded by putting tanks and troops on the streets and the banks of the Congo River, which separates the two cities, until it became clear that no attack on the capital was under way. Impene said a short circuit the suspected cause of the fire. Authorities are treating the blaze as accidental, Bangana said. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse and journalist Fred Robarts contributed to this report.","Hospitals are overflowing with wounded, an official says .

1765,"(CNN) -- The world of Formula One may seem an unlikely source of inspiration for a major carbon-cutting initiative, but technology used for coordinating pit-stops is primed to slash emissions from airports across the globe. According to Britain's National Air Traffic Services (NATS), more than half the planes landing at London's Heathrow airport are stuck in circles overhead -- often for 20 minutes at a time -- as they wait for its congested runways to clear. NATS says the carbon cost of this pile-up in the sky is an estimated 600 tons a day. And this is where McLaren, the hugely successful Formula One team behind former world champions Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, have come in with an unexpected solution. Over the years the company has developed modeling software to analyze live racing data and visualize a range of potential scenarios -- allowing pit crews to make strategic decisions in the blink of an eye -- all in an effort to get their cars back out onto the racetrack milliseconds ahead of their competitors. It's this ground-level tracking technology that could hold the key to unlocking congestion, reducing CO2 emissions by streamlining the way aircraft make their own pit-stops once they've landed -- dropping off passengers, refueling and departing again with F1 efficiency. This similarity between a motor race and an airport runway was first observed by Peter Tomlinson, head of aviation data solutions at NATS, while attending a workshop on cross-industry collaboration at McLaren's UK technology center three years ago. ""It became clear that the pit-stop in a race track, with cars coming in, changing tyres and refueling and going out again actually is pretty similar to an aircraft arriving at the airport, parking at the gate, passengers getting off, refueling and going out,"" said the air traffic veteran, who has over 30 years experience in the industry. The beauty of McLaren's system is that it reduces the complexity of a racetrack into a circle ""so at the point of decision, presentation of the data is very simple, which allows the engineer in a very stressful environment to make the right strategic decision and also see the data in a very clear, crisp format,"" said Tomlinson. For the last three years NATS has been working with McLaren's engineers to map Heathrow's taxiways and runways -- much as they do a Formula One track. But now, says Tomlinson, in place of a race strategist the system is operated by Heathrow's air traffic control, and instead of a circle the airport's network of runways and taxi lanes are represented by a simple rectangle -- enabling planes to be guided around the airport with greater ease and accuracy once they've landed. The collaboration has been ""groundbreaking"" according to Geoff McGrath, managing director of McLaren Applied Technologies -- the F1 team's tech division. ""To my knowledge this is a first -- NATS has invested in this because there is nothing like it available,"" he added. The system is now in its ""proof of concept"" stage and hopes are high that it will be used by airports around the world within a year. ""Think in terms of the environmental benefits of that,"" enthused Tomlinson. ""Large airports with about 1300 to 1400 flights a day - if you save just one minute of taxi time per flight on average, that equates to one day's worth of taxi time - and that's how much we could save using McLaren's technology.""","London's Heathrow airport hopes to cut C02 emissions by using motor racing technology .

1766,"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least nine people were killed and at least 72 others wounded Tuesday when four car bombs and a roadside bomb exploded in mostly Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad, police officials said. The first two attacks took place in Sadr City, an area in eastern Baghdad, police said. A car bomb exploded in al-Mudhafar Square, near a group of laborers who were waiting to be picked up for a daily job, police said. A few minutes later, a second car bomb exploded near a busy fuel station. Police said seven people were killed and 35 people were injured in the attacks in Sadr City, which is home to about 1.5 million people. A third car bomb exploded on a road in the al-Hurriya neighborhood in southwestern Baghdad, killing at least one person and wounding 13 others, police said. In a fourth attack, a roadside bomb wounded six people when it exploded near Adan Square in northwestern Baghdad. And a fifth explosion, a car bomb, blew up near an elementary school in the Shulaa neighborhood of northwestern Baghdad, police said. Two people were killed, and 18 others -- including some students from the elementary school -- were wounded. Since the beginning of this year, a wave of attacks in Iraq have killed almost 200 people. Most of those killed were Shiites marking Arbaeen, a Shiite pilgrimage at the end of a 40-day period commemorating the seventh century Imam Hussain, who was killed in a battle. The latest attacks raised concerns among ordinary people about the ability of Iraqi security forces to ensure security in this country, particularly after the United States withdrew troops by the end of 2011. However, Iraqi people are more concerned now about the political crisis. Last week, Iraq's Council of Ministers decided to ban members who are boycotting Cabinet meetings, a government spokesman said. The banned ministers will not be allowed to manage their ministries, according to spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh. Last month, the Sunni-backed Iraqiya party announced it would boycott parliament and Cabinet meetings, saying Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shiite, was cutting the party out of the decision-making process. Iraqiya spokeswoman Maysoun Damluji said the Iraqiya bloc was not surprised by the prime minister's move, calling it unconstitutional and illegal. Iraq's political crisis deepened last year when a warrant was issued for Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who is accused of organizing his security detail into a death squad that targeted government and military officials. Al-Hashimi has denied the charges, saying the accusations are politically motivated amid the rivalry between his political bloc and al-Maliki's Shiite majority bloc. In recent weeks, Iraq's Kurdish president, Jalal Talabani, called for a ""national conference"" to address the political crisis. But in the past week, a number of Sunni politicians who are members of Iraqiya bloc were arrested in Baghdad and Diyala province, officials with Iraqiya bloc said. Diyala's deputy governor in charge of investment, Ghadban al-Khazraji, was arrested Friday by Iraqi security forces. Former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi recently accused al-Maliki of targeting al-Iraqiya members and deepening the political crisis. Allawi warned al-Maliki that if the national conference fails, he will have no choice but to call for changing the prime minister and call for early elections, or the Iraqiya bloc will completely withdraw from the political process -- a move that could bring Iraqi politics to complete standstill.","A blast near an elementary school kills two and injures 18, including some students .

1768,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The United Nations has established more than a thousand health clinics across Pakistan in the wake of widespread flooding, a U.N. official said. ""Almost 1,200 mobile health clinics are operating across Pakistan,"" said Maurizio Giuliano with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. ""For many people, this is the only way to receive health care."" Water-borne illnesses from contaminated flood waters have erupted nationwide. At least 1 million Pakistanis have crippling diarrhea or respiratory infections. About 65,000 cases of malaria have been reported. ""More than 2 million people have received health care through this system, especially for diarrhea diseases, acute respiratory infections, skin and eye disease,"" he said. ""These clinics reach even the remotest areas with teams sometimes walking for six hours and carrying 20 kilograms [44 pounds] of medical supplies on their backs."" The death toll in the country has climbed to 1,738, the Pakistan Disaster Authority said over the weekend. Officials said last week that 17 million have been affected nationwide. The death toll is expected to rise significantly as flood waters continue to recede and more bodies surface. Pakistani flood victims face perilous journey home . On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama issued a presidential order authorizing emergency funds to Pakistan's flood victims, the White House said. The president said the use of the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund was in the United States' interest. Up to $33 million can go toward the country's crisis. The United Nations warned that a crisis is building in the eastern province of Balochistan, where nearly 2 million people are affected. There is a ""humanitarian tragedy"" with immediate threats of water-borne diseases and food shortages, said Mengeshe Kebede, the Office of the U.N.

1769,"(CNN)  -- The turboprop plane that crashed in New York state, killing all 49 people on board and one on the ground, was one of the safest and most sophisticated aircraft of its type, according to an aviation industry expert. Scandinavian Airlines grounded its fleet of Dash 8 Q400 planes after three crash landings in 2007. The Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 was less than one year old and had flown for only about 1,500 hours, said Kieran Daly, of the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence. The Continental Connection Flight 3407 was operated by Colgan Air between Newark Liberty International Airport and Buffalo. Daly said propeller-driven aircraft such as the Canadian-built Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 and its European rival, the ATR series, had sold well to airlines in the last three years because they were almost as fast as jets, cruising at about 480 kilometers/hour (300 mph), but used much less fuel.  Listen to audio of plane's last moments » . However, despite an excellent safety record, some passengers were still wary of traveling on propeller planes, he said. Daly said that for most of the time turboprops were as safe as similar-sized, 50-seater jets, but in icy conditions turboprops were at a disadvantage. Stressing that the cause of Thursday's crash in near Buffalo was still unclear and could be caused by mechanical failure for example, he said the potential for ice was there because it was short and the plane would have been flying at a relatively low level. Watch what iReporter captured on film . Daly said the pilot appeared not to have reported problems with icing, but this was not unusual because planes were designed to cope with these conditions. ""All aircraft have de-icing system: a big jet like a 747 can cope with ice almost indefinitely, but smaller planes, especially propeller planes can experience problems,"" he said. ""Pilots cope by increasing altitude -- icing mainly occurs at lower levels -- but because propeller-driven planes are slower, they take longer to reach high altitude and spend longer in the icy conditions."" According to the National Weather Service weather observation for Buffalo, there was light snow, fog and mist shortly before 10 p.m.  Watch more on the plane crash » . CNN has listened to a tape of communications between air traffic control and the flight crew. The first officer had no sign of stress in her voice initially. The plane was cleared for approach. About two minutes later, the air traffic controller came back, with stress in his voice. Radar contact was lost.  Watch report from witness: ""All I saw was flames"" » . The question went out: Can other planes see anything? No one responds. The controller says they might have a plane down. The pilot's last comment was ""Colgan Flight 3407."" There were no sounds of distress.  Watch video from CNN affiliate WGRZ » . Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) permanently grounded its fleet of Dash 8s after three crash landings during a two-month period in 2007 that were blamed on the aircraft's landing gear. ""Confidence in the Q400 has diminished considerably and our customers are becoming increasingly doubtful about flying in this type of aircraft,"" Mats Jansson, president and CEO of SAS, said at the time. ""I have decided to immediately remove Dash 8 Q400 aircraft from service."" Air expert Daly said though that in Thursday's crash the landing gear of the Continental plane was unlikely to be down because it was far from the airport. The National Transportation Safety Board said early Friday it was preparing to send a team to Buffalo to investigate the crash. Thursday's plane crash is the deadliest on U.S. soil since August 2006 when Comair Flight 5191 crashed when it attempted to take off from the wrong runway.","Air expert: Turboprop plane that crashed in New York one of safest of its type  Officials say all 49 aboard the plane died; one confirmed death on ground .

1770,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Cholera is caused by becoming infected with a bacterium called vibrio cholera. It's a disease that affects the bowels and in its most severe form is characterized by acute watery diarrhoea that can lead to immediate death through severe dehydration and kidney failure. A man from Zimbabwe wheels his sick relative to a cholera clinic. Almost 12,000 people have contracted cholera since August in Zimbabwe, and the outbreak threatens to kill even greater numbers as the water situation becomes more desperate. Unicef says it plans on providing a month's supply of water treatment chemicals for the capital Harare where water supply has been cut off because the government of Robert Mugabe is unable to buy chemicals needed to clean tap water. With the world's eyes on Zimbabwe where it is estimated that more than 500 people have already died , many myths and misconceptions abound about cholera. CNN compiles some crucial cholera facts: . --Unlike other diarrhoeal diseases, cholera can kill a healthy adult within hours. --Cholera's short incubation period of two hours to five days enhances the potential for increased outbreaks . --Seventy-five percent of people infected with cholera do not exhibit any symptoms. --A total of 236 896 cases were reported in 2006, an overall increase of 79% compared with the number of cases reported in 2005 . --People who have HIV or are malnourished have a greater risk of dying from cholera than others. --The disease is mostly spread through contaminated water and food supplies. --The belief that cholera epidemics are caused by dead bodies after a disaster is false. --Cholera remains a problem in almost every developing country . --If untreated, as many as one in two people may die. --The true burden of the disease is grossly underestimated as not all cases are reported.

1771,"Paris (CNN) -- Search teams retrieved a body from the wreckage of the Air France airbus that crashed into the Atlantic in 2009, the French Interior Ministry said. The body was still attached to a seat and ""appeared degraded,"" the ministry added in a written statement. ""The attempts to bring up the bodies were made in particularly complex conditions. Considerable uncertainties still remain regarding the technical feasibility of recovering the bodies,"" the French Ministry statement said. DNA samples from the remains -- recovered from a depth of 3900 meters (12,700 feet) - will be sent to a laboratory for analysis, the statement added. Thursday's announcement came days after the flight recorders were located. All 228 people aboard the Airbus A330 Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris were killed on June 1, 2009. Until now, 50 bodies had been recovered on the surface after the crash. However, some relatives of those who died have expressed reservations about remains being brought to the surface. Last month Robert Soulas, head of a support group for families of flight victims, said: ""For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed."" Other relatives have called for the bodies to be recovered. The Airbus A330's pilots lost contact with air traffic controllers while flying across an area of the Atlantic Ocean known for constant bands of severe turbulence, officials said. But exactly what caused the plane to plunge into the sea has remains a mystery. France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said on Thursday that the external casings of both the flight recorders -- which record data and cockpit voices -- were in good condition and that they had started a ""drying"" process. It would take a couple of days for the units to dry and then approximately a week or two before they could determine if both were still working, the BEA said. Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the Paris-based BEA said that even if there was some internal damage to the recorders, some data might still be recoverable. ""We must be very very careful... we are confident but it will take time for us to know whether we can retrieve all the data."" Phil Seymour, chief operating officer of the International Bureau of Aviation, a British aviation consultancy, said: ""I remain skeptical about how useful this device (memory unit) will be. If you were to throw a computer into the ocean, imagine how all the parts would eventually split up. You also have the corrosive effects of seawater and the immense depths involved.""","Search teams retrieved a body from the wreckage of the Air France airbus .

1772,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Last week, the Obama administration announced that the deep waters of the Gulf are again open for drilling. That the BP oil disaster is continuing and will have lasting effects is unacknowledged. The BP disaster was the largest oil catastrophe the country has ever seen, and the Gulf of Mexico and our communities have a long road to recovery. Our friends in the fishing industry are still out of work, the effects of the spill on wildlife have not been fully assessed, the safety of our seafood is still in question and entire cultures are barely hanging on. The administration says new rules and regulations will make deepwater oil drilling safer. Although we welcome the new rules, we believe that they do not go far enough. There is little assurance that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, charged with enforcement, has the resources to hold the industry accountable. Gulf Restoration Network believes further steps must be taken immediately to ensure the safety of oil drilling in deep off-shore waters. The government and the public need to stay focused on the disaster and environmental impacts that are just beginning to play out, continue to hold BP accountable and act to make sure this never happens again. We hope the Obama administration approaches continued cleanup, regulatory reform and damage mitigation, none of which is even close to being accomplished, with the same urgency it has shown in efforts to reopen the Gulf to deepwater drilling. BP's spill is only the latest and most visible evidence of the oil and gas industry's ongoing environmental destruction in the Gulf. Louisiana loses the equivalent of a football field worth of wetlands every hour, and 40 to 60 percent of that loss is attributed to oil and gas activity, including exploration and dredging of pipeline canals. The oil and gas industry must pay its fair share for coastal restoration, and a large portion of the fines levied against BP should be dedicated to ongoing restoration efforts. Despite what the rest of the oil industry claims, BP is not a rogue player when it comes to taking big risks at the expense of the Gulf. Other oil and gas companies have violated safety and environmental regulations. Regulatory reforms and policy changes are urgently needed to prevent drilling disasters, ensure oil-rig safety in the Gulf and elsewhere and guarantee rapid response and cleanup when accidents happen. Industry in the Gulf still lacks the necessary assets to effectively respond to a catastrophic blowout. In light of the abysmal response, containment and cleanup we have observed and continue to observe in the aftermath of the BP disaster, it's clear that we need new rules that require real, credible blowout response plans before any new deepwater drilling is permitted. There is only one way to make sure the federal agencies and the oil and gas industry remain vigilant and operate as safely as possible -- local communities must have a voice in decisions regarding oil and gas development. Because we are the ones who pay the price for the industry's bad decisions, we deserve a seat at the table. An opposing view on reopening the Gulf to deepwater drilling . A Gulf of Mexico Regional Citizens' Advisory Council is essential to formalizing the public's role in overseeing what the industry does in our Gulf. It worked in Alaska after the Exxon Valdez spill, and it will work in the Gulf. Congress should pass legislation to create and require the oil industry to fund a Gulf of Mexico Regional Citizens' Advisory Council. Congress must also do its part to aid restoration of the Gulf. The White House's ""America's Gulf Coast: A Plan for Long-Term Recovery in the Aftermath of the BP Oil Spill,"" assembled by Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, lays out a vision for community recovery, improving public health, coastal restoration and marine resiliency that can begin to restore the Gulf. We strongly urge Congress to support the plan and ensure BP fines go toward restoring the Gulf. Early this month, 46 community, local, regional, national and international environmental, social justice and fishermen's groups met in Weeks Bay, Alabama. We drafted a set of goals and principles that we believe must guide the recovery and restoration of the Gulf of Mexico, our coast and our communities in the wake of the BP drilling disaster. It's called The Weeks Bay Principles for Gulf Recovery. Together, we want the nation to know that the oil is still here, and so are we. The Gulf's people and places need lasting and continued support to get back on their feet.

1773,"(CNN) -- Oil company BP shouldered some responsibility for the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster Wednesday after an internal investigation of the spill, but assigned much of the blame to contractors Halliburton and Transocean. Faulty cementing, a misread pressure test and an improperly maintained blowout preventer all contributed to the April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig and led to the worst oil spill in U.S. history, BP's nearly 200-page report on the disaster concluded. ""The team did not identify any single action or inaction that caused this accident,"" BP's report states. ""Rather, a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures, human judgments, engineering design, operational implementation and team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident. Multiple companies, work teams and circumstances were involved over time."" Both Halliburton and Transocean sharply disputed the findings, with Transocean calling them ""self-serving"" and Halliburton insisting that the problem lay with BP's well design. In a corporate statement, Halliburton said the report contained ""a number of substantial omissions and inaccuracies."" ""Halliburton remains confident that all the work it performed with respect to the Macondo well was completed in accordance with BP's specifications for its well construction plan and instructions, and that it is fully indemnified under its contract for any of the allegations contained in the report,"" the company said. A Halliburton engineer also criticized BP's well design during an August hearing by the Coast Guard-Interior Department board investigating the disaster. But in a statement accompanying the report, outgoing BP chief Tony Hayward said the well design was not the issue. ""Based on the report, it would appear unlikely that the well design contributed to the incident, as the investigation found that the hydrocarbons flowed up the production casing through the bottom of the well,"" he said. In July, Hayward said the disaster ""was the result of multiple equipment errors and human error involving many companies."" Bob Dudley, who is replacing Hayward, said Wednesday's report ""makes that conclusion even clearer."" BP's report also found ""potential weaknesses"" in Transocean's maintenance of the rig's blowout preventer, the massive fail-safe device that failed to shut down the well after the explosion. BP said its team aboard the doomed platform ""incorrectly accepted"" results of a negative pressure test on the rig before the blast and mistakenly rejected equipment that cement contractor Halliburton requested to complete the well's casing. Rep. Ed Markey, the head of a congressional subcommittee also investigating the spill, said the report was no ""mea culpa"" on BP's part. ""Of their own eight key findings, they only explicitly take responsibility for half of one,"" said Markey, D-Massachusetts. ""BP is happy to slice up blame, as long as they get the smallest piece."" Several other investigations are still going on, including probes by Congress and the Justice Department. Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the Obama administration's point man for the disaster, said the BP report was ""not the be-all and end-all"" on the matter. ""I would just say the more we know about this event in general, the better off we are,"" Allen told reporters Wednesday. ""It'll add to a larger body of evidence that, or body of work, that might be, won't be completed until we finish the joint investigation by the Department of Interior and Homeland Security, and the other various investigations that are going on."" And Aaron Viles, a spokesman for the Louisiana-based Gulf Restoration Network, largely dismissed the report. ""While any investigation headed up by BP has as much credibility as my 3-year-old daughter's nightly assertions that it's not bedtime yet, BP cops to much, but not all here,"" Viles said in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon. ""Ultimately, the report is going to be used to bolster BP's case against the other potentially responsible parties, such as Transocean and Halliburton."" Viles said that while tracking the cause of the explosion is important, ""fighting the last war won't necessarily prepare us for the next, inevitable mess."" As the well owner, BP is responsible for the cleanup and has set aside a $20 billion escrow fund to pay for damages. But BP, Halliburton and Transocean have repeatedly pointed fingers at one another over the cause of the explosion, which resulted in an estimated 4.9 million barrels (205 million gallons) of oil spilling into the Gulf over 87 days. In Wednesday's report, BP said its team aboard the rig misread a critical pressure test in the hours before the explosion. ""In retrospect, pressure readings and volume bled at the time of the negative-pressure test were indications of flow-path communication with the reservoir, signifying that the integrity of these barriers had not been achieved,"" the report states. ""The Transocean rig crew and BP well site leaders reached the incorrect view that the test was successful and that well integrity had been established."" Neither of BP's well site leaders, Robert Kaluza and Donald Vidrine, has appeared before the investigative board. Kaluza has invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, while Vidrine was excused for medical reasons. BP's investigation found that Halliburton used a ""likely unstable"" cement mix that was not fully tested before it was used. Mark Bly, BP's head of safety and operations, said in a video accompanying the report that Halliburton ""did not conduct comprehensive lab tests that could've identified potential problems with the cement."" But he added, ""We believe that BP and Halliburton working together should have better identified and addressed the issues underlying the cement job."" But Halliburton engineer Jesse Gagliano testified in August that he warned BP that its well design was inadequate. Appearing before the investigative board, Gagliano said he told BP that the well design did not have enough centralizers -- devices used to position the cement casing around the well bore. The design called for six centralizers, but Gagliano recommended 21 because of the ""severe gas flow problem"" in the well. BP engineer Brian Morel replied by e-mail that ""It was too late and we had to deal with what we had on the rig,"" Gagliano testified. In addition, e-mails from BP engineers, released by a congressional committee in June, suggest that the oil company had its own concerns about the well. Drilling engineer Brian Morel called it a ""nightmare well which has everyone all over the place,"" while Mark Hafle called it ""a crazy well."" Both Hafle and Morel invoked their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination during the most recent round of hearings by the investigative board. Eventually, 15 more centralizers were shipped to the rig. BP's well team ""erroneously believed that they had received the wrong centralizers"" and decided not to use them, according to Wednesday's report -- but the decision not to use them ""likely did not contribute to the cement's failure to isolate the main hydrocarbon zones or to the failure of the shoe track cement."" BP's report also faults Transocean's crew for failing ""to recognize and act on the influx of hydrocarbons into the well until the hydrocarbons were in the riser and rapidly flowing to the surface."" ""Indications of influx with an increase in drill pipe pressure are discernible in real-time data from approximately 40 minutes before the rig crew took action to control the well,"" the report states. ""The rig crew's first apparent well control actions occurred after hydrocarbons were rapidly flowing to the surface."" In its response, Transocean said BP made decisions that increased the chances that flammable gas would come flowing out of the well. It also failed to run a common test on the integrity of the cement or to employ a ""lockdown sleeve"" that would have helped contain the eventual blowout, it said.","NEW: Halliburton says BP's report has ""substantial omissions and inaccuracies""

1774,"(CNN) -- It's football season: From Pop Warner, Young American Football League and other children's football leagues; from high school to college and the pros, football is the name of the game. Unfortunately, it's also a time when we see sports-related concussions, particularly among children. This year, there will be millions of sports-related concussions and many of them will go undiagnosed. Around 300,000 will result in a player losing consciousness. Research indicates that multiple concussions may lead to dementia and lasting brain damage, and more concussions happen in football than in other sport. The result is a brain injury epidemic that affects 4.5 million players who are still too young to play in the NFL. Football is a tough sport, but the concussion epidemic is a problem we can work to fix. Part of the issue is the culture of the game. Retired NFL great Nick ""the Kick"" Lowery, the all-time leading scorer for the Kansas City Chiefs and one of the greatest kickers to play the game, wrote to me about his experiences. ""When I played football, suffering a concussion was often shrugged off as merely having your 'bell rung,'"" Lowery wrote. ""My teammates had no shortage of toughness and wanted to build the mentality to out-tough our opponents. We now know that multiple concussions can lead to lasting brain damage and should be treated as a serious matter."" The good news is that concussions are being treated as a serious matter, more and more. New Mexico is one of several states with a sports concussion law. It requires that coaches be trained about concussions and brain injuries, and that students who suffer concussions must stay on the sidelines for at least a week, and until a medical professional approves his or her return to play. But coaching is not the only way to approach the problem. When kids step onto the field, they need to be confident that their safety equipment will provide adequate protection. Far too often it doesn't keep the young athlete as safe as it should. Although football helmet safety has improved since the days of leather helmets, today's voluntary football helmet safety standards don't take our modern understanding of concussion risks into account. For example, the industry standard primarily protects against serious injury from a severe, direct blow â€” but it does not address the risk of a concussion caused by less severe impacts, or by hits that spin the head and brain. The standard for reconditioning used football helmets also does not specify how often these old helmets must be recertified. One young student-athlete, Max Conradt, returned to play too soon after suffering a concussion. Max was wearing a 20-year-old helmet when he suffered another concussion that led to brain damage. His parents wrote me asking, ""How is it possible that our son was issued a helmet three years older than he was?"" Unfortunately, about 100,000 helmets out there are more than a decade old. These helmets are on the heads of high school and younger football players across the country this season. As knowledge of head injuries improves, some companies advertise newer helmets with sweeping safety claims. Young athletes could put themselves at greater risk if they think a new ""anti-concussion"" helmet, headband, or mouth guard makes them invulnerable to brain injury. We can do better than this. Parents should be able to let their kids play football confident that the equipment they're using has been created with the best science and technology for protection of injury. That's why I introduced the Children's Sports Athletic Equipment Safety Act. This bipartisan legislation, which has been endorsed by the National Football League Players Association, would help ensure that new and reconditioned football helmets for high school and younger players meet safety standards that specifically address concussion risk and the needs of young athletes. The bill also increases potential penalties for using false injury prevention claims to sell helmets or any other children's sports equipment. There will always be some risk of injury in football â€” it's inevitably part of the game. But, we must make sure that athletes, coaches and parents know about the dangers and signs of concussion; we must make sure that they are using safe equipment; and we must take any false advertising out of the game. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sen. Tom Udall.","Tom Udall: Millions of sports-related concussions a year; most happen in football .

1775,"(CNN) -- Pacific Gas & Electric Co. will pay San Bruno, California, $70 million in restitution for the pipeline rupture that killed eight people and destroyed dozens of homes in September 2010, the utility and city said Monday. ""This money will be used for the benefit of all the citizens of our city and to help us, as a community, get beyond the tragedy and devastation caused by PG&E's explosion and fire,"" San Bruno Mayor Jim Ruane said in a joint news release. Federal officials said in August that a faulty pipe, flawed operations and inadequate government oversight led to the natural gas explosion in the San Francisco suburb. ""The community of San Bruno has suffered through a terrible tragedy and we understand that this accident will affect this community forever,"" PG&E President Chris Johns said. The city will establish a separate not-for-profit public purpose entity to manage the funds and determine how the restitution should be spent for the benefit of the community as a whole, the statement said. ""This $70 million payment is in addition to PG&E's commitment to fund replacement and repair of the city's infrastructure and other costs related to the accident and restoration of the neighborhood,"" it said. ""The utility will not seek to recover the contribution through insurance or customer rates."" During a public board meeting after delivering their final report on the matter, National Transportation Safety Board investigators sharply criticized pipeline owner PG&E for the explosion, saying the pipe was inadequate from the time it was installed in 1956. That was compounded ""by a litany of failures"" over the years, including poor record-keeping, inadequate inspection programs and ""an integrity management program without integrity,"" NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said. ""It was not a question of if this pipeline would burst,"" she said. ""It was a question of when."" Hersman said the probe yielded ""troubling revelations about a company that exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight, and government agencies that placed a blind trust in operators to the detriment of public safety.""","Money from PG&E will benefit all citizens, San Bruno's mayor says .
""This accident will affect this community forever,"" says PG&E president .

1776,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It is still remembered as one of the worst days in the history of modern sailing. The Fastnet race still remains one of the biggest events in the yachting calendar. Yet the Fastnet tragedy of 1979 in which 15 people were killed and ex-British leader Edward Heath went missing helped to usher in a new era of improved safety in the sport. It was 30 years ago today that a freak storm struck over 300 vessels competing in the 600-mile yacht race between England and Ireland. Mountainous seas and vicious high winds sunk or put out of action 25 boats. The British rescue attempt turned into an international effort with a Dutch warship and trawlers from France also joining the search. In spite of the biggest rescue operation launched by the UK authorities since the Second World War a total of 15 people died. Some of them drowned and others succumbed to hypothermia. Six of those lost went missing after their safety harnesses broke. ""It was a catastrophic event that had far-reaching consequences for the sport, the biggest of which was in the design and safety of the boats,"" Rodger Witt, editor of the UK-based magazine Sailing Today told CNN. ""Most people in the sailing community at the time knew someone who was involved in one way or another. I had a friend who lost his father. It was devastating."" In total 69 yachts did not finish the race. The former British prime minister, Edward Heath disappeared at the height of the storm, though he later returned to shore safe from harm. The corrected-time winner of the race was the yacht ""Tenacious"", owned and skippered by Ted Turner, the founder of CNN. Witt said that in the aftermath of the disaster the rules governing racing were tightened to ensure boats carried more ballast. Improvements were also made to the safety harnesses that tied crewmen to their boats, many of which proved ineffective in the tragedy. It also became mandatory for all yachts to be fitted with radio communication equipment and all competitors were expected to hold sailing qualifications to take part. At the time of the tragedy the Fastnet race was the last in a series of five races which made up the Admiral's Cup competition, the world championship of yacht racing. Competitors from around the globe attempted the route which sets off from the Isle of Wight, off the English south coast, and rounds the Fastnet rock on the southeast coast of Ireland. Roger Ware was in charge of handling press for the event on behalf of the organizers, the Royal Ocean Racing Club. Ware said that even today the tragedy ""still spooks me."" The racers set off on a Saturday but it wasn't till three days later that the authorities in the English coastal town of Plymouth realized there was a problem. The press team was based at the Duke of Cornwall hotel in Plymouth and early Tuesday morning Ware got a call from his superiors to go to the hotel immediately in order to field calls from journalists. ""The night before we'd noticed high winds but there'd been no forecast of bad weather so we didn't think much of it,"" Ware told CNN. ""As the morning progressed though, we heard that more and more boats were missing. It became obvious a tragedy was unfolding."" Ware said the worst part for him was fielding calls from concerned relatives. ""The Royal Ocean Racing Club headquarters was overloaded so calls were getting transferred to the press team. ""I found myself talking to a woman whose husband I knew was in one of the boats where there'd been fatalities. I couldn't give her the information she wanted and to this day I still think about that telephone call.""","The 1979 Fastnet race ended in tragedy after a freak storm hit competitors .

1777,"(AP) --   The world's largest jetliner made aviation history Thursday, completing its first commercial flight from Singapore to Sydney with 455 passengers, some of them ensconced in luxury suites and double beds. Australians Tony and Julie Elwood share a romantic moment on their double bed in an exclusive suite aboard the Airbus 380. The Airbus superjumbo lifted off from Singapore's Changi Airport and landed about seven hours later in Sydney. Also aboard Flight SQ380 was a crew of about 30, including four pilots. Flight attendants handed out champagne and certificates to passengers, some of whom paid tens of thousands of dollars in an online auction for seats. ""I have never been in anything like this in the air before in my life,"" said Australian Tony Elwood, reclining with his wife, Julie, on the double bed in their private first-class suite. ""It is going to make everything else after this simply awful,"" he said, sipping Dom Perignon champagne after a lunch of marinated lobster and double boiled chicken soup. He paid $50,000 for the two places. The double-decker A380 ends the nearly 37-year reign of the Boeing 747 jumbojet as the world's most spacious passenger plane. Its European manufacturer, Airbus SAS, also claims that the A380 is the most fuel efficient and quietest passenger jet ever built. Thomas Lee, who was also on the Boeing 747's first commercial flight from New York to London in 1970, described the latest experience as ""spectacular ... fantastic ... incredible."" ""It was a festive atmosphere, I can tell you. Everybody was excited. People were up out of their seats in the aisle. It was quite difficult for the cabin crew to do their job ... not like a normal flight I can assure you,"" he said. The A380 was delivered to Singapore Airlines on Oct. 15, nearly two years behind schedule after billions of dollars in cost overruns for Airbus. Still, the wait was worth it, says Singapore Airlines, which got the exclusivity of being the plane's sole operator for 10 months. ""This is indeed a new milestone in the timeline of aviation,"" said Chew Choon Seng, chief executive of Singapore Airlines (SIA) in a speech before the departure. The Boeing 747 jumbo jet generally carries about 400 passengers. The A380 -- as tall as a seven-story building with each wing big enough to hold 70 cars -- is capable of carrying 853 passengers in an all-economy class configuration. However, Singapore Airlines opted for 471 seats in three classes -- 2 Singapore Airlines Suites, 60 business class and 399 economy class. Each suite, enclosed by sliding doors, is fitted with a leather upholstered seat, a table, a 23-inch flat screen TV, laptop connections and a range of office software. A separate bed folds up into the wall. Two of the suites can be joined to provide double beds, one of which the Elwoods occupied. On the upper deck, business class seats can turn into wide flat beds, while the economy class seats on both decks have more leg and knee room, the carrier says. Business class passengers also have a bar area. Francis Wu, a student from San Francisco who turned 22 on the flight, was updating his journal on the in-flight computer system when airline crew surprised him with a white chocolate cake and a song. ""This is the best birthday I have ever had in my whole life,"" he said. SIA auctioned most of the seats on the inaugural flight on eBay, raising $1.26 million for charity. The highest bidder was Briton Julian Hayward who bought two suite seats for $100,380. He was the first passenger to board. SIA has ordered 19 of the A380s, hoping to benefit from a boom in air travel that has seen global air traffic growing 5 to 10 percent a year. Dubai-based Emirates, Airbus' largest A380 customer with 55 on order, will take its first delivery in August. Not all analysts are convinced that the plane, which has a list price of $320 million, will be a success. ""I see there's some demand for the A380, but it's an expensive way to address a small market,"" said Standard & Poor's Equity Research analyst Shukor Yusof. Shukor said the market was set to be dominated by mid-sized, long haul two-engine aircraft such as the rival Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which offers greater fuel efficiency than four-engine jets of the same size. He pointed out that orders for the 787 have exceeded 700. The A380 has received 165 orders to date. Shukor noted that Singapore Airlines renews its fleet frequently to maintain an average age of about six years. Once the planes are older than six years, Singapore Airlines might have trouble selling them, he said. ""What would happen if the plane didn't meet their expectations, say, in a year? Would SIA be tempted to sell it? What is the secondary value of the plane? It has not been commercially tested yet,"" Shukor said.

1778,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Since last year's Tohoku earthquake, the scenes of devastation and Daiichi nuclear disaster immediately come to mind when people hear ""Fukushima."" Few see the beauty of Fukushima's landscape, both before the quake and how it now remains.Two photographers, Frances Tong and Katsumi Omori, respectively from Hong Kong and from Japan, are determined to offer artistic alternative. ""In spring, the mist filled up each and every space in the air. In autumn, the falling leaves colored the forest and the sweet scent of maple leaves merged with every breath that I drew in ... and that's the image of Fukushima that I can recall,"" said Tong, an amateur Hong Kong photographer who went to Fukushima prefecture several times before the earthquake. ""Fukushima after the quake is no longer the Fukushima that I once visited,"" said Tong. ""Despite the sad side of Fukushima, I want to show its peaceful and hopeful side as well. The scenes of Fukushima that I've seen on television are so dark and devastated."" Tong founded a charity organization called ""Friends of Fukushima,"" which set up three photo exhibitions in Hong Kong showing 30 photographs of Fukushima's mountains and lakes for charity. Earlier this year, $12,000 was raised and donated to Citizens Nuclear Information Centre, an anti-nuclear organization in Japan, to help the Fukushima nuclear plant workers. Tong, a 36-year-old business development manager, discovered Fukushima prefecture's scenery during a business trip in 2007. Since then, Tong went to Fukushima every year to capture the scenery on film. Tong says she feels a bond with the prefecture's environment, including one unforgettable sunrise. ""I woke up at 3:30 in the morning. I waited there for hours with my tripod. I witnessed the rising sun gradually lightening up the sky, from dark to dawn to morning. I felt so light and relaxed, as if I was merged with nature,"" said Tong. Rather than looking back in the past, Katsumi Omori chose to show the existing beauty of Fukushima. Right after the quake, Omori, who lives in the Tokyo suburb of Urayasu, felt the need to go to the affected areas last April. ""The world has changed. It wasn't what it was before,"" the 48-year-old said. ""I had to see it for myself."" Without any precise idea of what would be seen in the area, he decided to head to Fukushima to take pictures of ""sakura"". These Japanese cherry blossoms are the main theme of his ongoing artistic project since 2001, consisting largely of photos taken in Tokyo and his neighborhood. ""Sakura is planted by people. I wanted to see how those people are living and their conditions,"" he said. His sakura photo series was presented to the British public in ""Everything Happens for the First Time"", his solo exhibition held in London, August 2011. ""People who were expecting to see the massive devastation caused by the tsunami and the earthquake might have been disappointed,"" he said. ""Those who saw my work as an artistic expression of my feelings told me that they really like my exhibition."" Omori wanted to show the ""unseen"" which has not been exposed by the media. He believed that, as a photographer, his job is to capture things out of the ordinary rather than what is easily seen. Some people told him they felt natsukashi, or ""nostalgia"" in Japanese, when looking at his pictures. Being a photographer for 20 years, he observed that artists' attitude has somewhat changed after this disaster. ""People seem to realize that things do break and things that humans made get washed away,"" he said. ""The way artists pay tribute has changed. Their works are sometimes offered to charity organizations and remember what happened."" Haruka Nuga contributed to this story .","To most people, scenes of Fukushima evoke death and destruction .

1779,"Jos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Tensions ran high in the central Nigerian city of Jos on Sunday in the aftermath of an explosion outside a Catholic church that left six people dead, according to hospital and government officials. The apparent car bomb attack happened outside of St. Finbar's Catholic Church, according to Plateau Gov. Jonah David Jang. A spokesman for the Plateau state government, Machias Abraham Yiljab, said three bodies were at the scene of the explosion. Ishaya Pam, chief medical director of the Jos University Teaching Hospital, said in a statement that the hospital had three bodies and was treating 14 people for wounds suffered in the explosion. He said additional people had been wounded in the blast, but had been treated and released. Images sent by Mark Lipdo, program coordinator for the Stefanos Foundation, showed a charred crater in the pavement, a vehicle bumper in the road and smoke rising in the distance. Stefanos is a foundation that aims to help persecuted Christians in Nigeria and elsewhere. After the explosion, youths took over a roadblock on the street leading to the church, and an agitated crowd of residents upset with the violence gathered nearby to talk with Jang. 'This is an unfortunate situation and we will do all we can to prevent future occurrences,"" Jang said. ""We all must be calm and we all must leave things in the hands of God who knows why he has allowed this to happen."" iReport photo from the scene . The explosion at St. Finbar's church was the second in two weeks at a Christian church. On February 26, a car packed with explosives rammed into the compound of the Cocin (Church of Christ) headquarters, killing three people. It was not clear if anyone had claimed responsibility for the attack. Nigeria has suffered a rash of attacks on churches and mosques in the last year. In December, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in several northern states following a series of Christmas Day attacks on churches. A shadowy Islamic militant group called Boko Haram has been frequently blamed for the violence on Christians, who have sometimes responded with reprisal attacks. In a statement issued by his spokesman, Jonathan urged residents to refrain from reprisal attacks. ""The President urges Nigerians not to despair or be discouraged by the persistence of the attacks in spite of government's efforts to deal decisively with the menace of terrorism within the country's borders because despite seeming appearances to the contrary, government is indeed winning the war against the terrorists and will continue to progressively destroy their ability to unleash murderous attacks on peaceful, law-abiding Nigerians,"" spokesman Reuben Abati said in the statement.","Six people confirmed dead in Nigeria court attack .

1780,"(CNN)  -- Trailing what would become a fatal flight by some 27 minutes, the same kind of aircraft operated by the same airline traveled the same route last week and landed safely, the NTSB said Monday. Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. The pilot of the second Continental Connection flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Buffalo, New York, reported ""moderate icing"" during the trip and ""made it to destination in Buffalo,"" said Steve Chealander of the National Transportation Safety Board. The second plane was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, like the plane that crashed Thursday night near the Buffalo airport, killing 49 people on board and one person on the ground. Also like the fatal flight, the aircraft was operated on the Continental Connection route by Colgan Air, Chealander said. Possible icing -- and how the aircraft and the flight crew performed if icing was an issue -- has become a focus in the aftermath of the crash of Flight 3407. The pilot and first officer of the flight discussed ""significant"" ice buildup on the aircraft's windshield and wings before the crash, the NTSB said after listening to the cockpit voice recorder. Chealander said Monday that he had been asked about possible icing on the aircraft's tail. ""If there's icing on the wings, there's icing on the tail,"" he said. ""The significance of that is yet to be determined."" The flight data recorder indicated the plane's deicing system was activated 11 minutes after takeoff from Newark and remained on until the crash, according to the NTSB. Chealander said investigators have recovered most of the pieces of that system and will examine those materials to determine whether the system was operating properly. Chealander also said questionnaires were being sent to every pilot who flew in the Buffalo vicinity the night of the crash to find out what icing conditions they might have encountered. He said the only report to air traffic controllers of ""severe"" icing that night came from a pilot ""well south of the Buffalo area."" On Sunday, Chealander gave details of the final violent seconds of the flight, saying the flight data recorder indicated that in the final seconds, the plane's nose pitched drastically up, then down, and the plane then rolled left 46 degrees and then right 105 degrees, or past the 90-degree vertical point. Before impact in a residential neighborhood, the plane fell 800 feet in five seconds, Chealander said. On Monday, he said about half the aircraft wreckage had been removed from the crash site and taken for detailed examination. Giving an indication of the explosive nature of the impact and subsequent fire, Chealander said wreckage is being taken away ""in bins and on trailers."" He said investigators hope to have all wreckage removed from the crash site by Wednesday, when a snowstorm is forecast for the area. Authorities have not discussed the status of the removal of victims' remains since Saturday night, when they said 15 bodies had been recovered.","NTSB says pilot who traveled same route in identical plane reported ""moderate icing""

1781,"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian emergency officials have begun evacuating 800 families from an area at high risk from the expected eruption of a volcano that killed at least six people in November. Colombians make their way across a landslide in November after the Nevado del Huila volcano erupted. The Nevado del Huila volcano is on orange alert, meaning an eruption is probable within days or weeks, the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining said last week. An eruption would cause an avalanche down the Paez and Simbola rivers, officials said. The town under evacuation, Belalcazar, sits on the bank of the Paez River about a half-mile (less than a kilometer) from the junction with the Simbola River. It was the worst-hit area in November's eruption. The volcano's crater holds 52 million cubic meters (1.8 billion cubic feet) of lava, said Colombia's Caracol Radio. That's the equivalent of 13.8 billion gallons. The Colombian national emergency agency said Monday it is ready to evacuate thousands of residents if the volcano's condition turns to red, which means an eruption is imminent or ongoing. The snow-capped Huila, the highest active volcano in Colombia, last erupted on November 20. At least six people, including four children, died then. Gas and hot ash caused snow on the mountain peak to melt, sending mud, rocks and floodwater rushing down the Paez and destroying at least 20 homes and washing out five bridges, the presidential office said at the time. Much of the sparsely populated region about 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Bogota is a reservation for Nasa indigenous communities. All six fatalities were native Indians, the government said. The youngest victim was a year old. The Huila volcano, which has a summit of 17,598 feet (5,364 meters), has erupted four times. The first documented eruption occurred in the 1500s, then it stood silent for more than 400 years, according to the Web site volcanolive.com. Colombian emergency officials said Monday they are asking the 800 families where they want to be moved to, Caracol Radio said. Scientists with the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining, commonly known as Ingeominas, said they did not detect any major action inside the volcano Monday, Caracol reported. Ingeominas and the National System for Emergencies are monitoring the volcano around the clock and have acquired new equipment, including additional telecommunication gear and an infrared camera to monitor Huila's temperature. Officials also plan to install a microphone on Huila to detect any new rumblings from inside the volcano, Caracol said. Officials already are monitoring the volcano with four stations that detect seismological activity, a video camera, a communications network and a system that measures mudflow, Caracol said.","Eruption likely within days or weeks at Nevado del Huila volcano, agency warns .

1782,"(CNN) -- Less than a year after a tornado swept through central Alabama, killing scores of people, a debris field created by that tornado caught fire Tuesday, threatening more than a dozen houses in the town of Brookwood, an official said. ""It is currently burning 100 acres in the tornado debris field,"" Alabama Forestry Commission Spokeswoman Coleen Vansant told CNN. The field was created April 27, when the powerful EF-4 tornado killed 64 people in Tuscaloosa and Jefferson counties and flattened a number of houses. Tornadoes took terrible toll almost a year ago . On Monday, firefighters contained a pile of burning debris that had spread, but it jumped the containment line on Tuesday in Brookwood, which has 1,483 residents and is about 17 miles east of Tuscaloosa. The fire then spread into a field of debris left by the tornado, threatening at least 20 houses, Vansant said. Among them were some that had been rebuilt after the tornado, she said. Dry weather, low humidity and gusty winds made the firefighters' job more difficult, she said.","Brookwood, Alabama, gets double whammy in less than a year .

Caleb Linn's remains were found in the South Fork River in northern Arkansas, according to Fulton County Sheriff's dispatcher Arles Lenderman. No foul play was suspected in his disappearance. Two T-shirts worn by Caleb were found Tuesday afternoon along the river at the Boy Scout camp where he was last seen, officials said. ""We had pictures of the boy when we he went missing. They were the same clothes he was wearing that day,"" Sheriff Buck Foley said. Caleb's family was devastated by the loss of a boy they described as having a genial disposition. ""He was full of life,"" stepfather Randy Muir told CNN affiliate KARK. ""He was an amazing young kid."" CNN affiliate KATV reported that the boy was last seen by his aunt on Saturday at Kia Kima Scout Reservation. Caleb had asked whether he could catch up with some other children who had gone back to a cabin area about 300 yards away, according to the station. The search covered about 1,000 acres, Foley said. The camp is near the Arkansas-Missouri border, about 160 miles north of Little Rock. Caleb's aunt and mother identified the clothes as the little boy's, Foley said. ""The family took it hard,"" he added.","NEW: ""He was full of life,"" stepfather says .

1786,"(CNN) -- Severe flooding in the Pacific island nation of Fiji has killed four people and left 800 people seeking shelter in evacuation centers, a government official said Monday. Tropical Cyclone Daphne has lashed Fiji's largest and most populous island, Viti Levu, with strong winds and heavy rain. The Fiji Meteorological Service said Monday that it was maintaining its severe flood warning for ""all major rivers, streams and low lying areas"" on the island. Sharon Smith Johns, the Fiji government's information secretary, said she was touring the affected areas with the prime minister, Voreqe Bainimarama. She said some people had started to try to move back to their homes. The extreme weather has disrupted both internal and external travel. Authorities on Sunday suspended inbound flights to Nadi International Airport because nearby roads were flooded. The suspension was lifted Monday but remained subject to review. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advised its country's citizens planning to fly into the airport ""to reconsider their need to travel.""

1787,"(CNN) -- Peanut butter makers not affected by the deadly salmonella outbreak linked to a Georgia peanut plant are trying to get consumers to keep buying peanut butter. It could be an uphill battle. J.M. Smucker Co. wants to assure consumers that its Jif brand of peanut butter is safe to eat. Companies such as ConAgra Foods Inc. and J.M. Smucker Co. have started running ads and offering coupons, trying to lure peanut butter customers as sales have plunged at least 20 percent since the salmonella outbreak. Eight people have died and nearly 600 have been sickened in the outbreak. The original peanut butter recall launched weeks ago has expanded to include more than 1,000 products. On ConAgra's Web site, a letter assures customers that the company's peanut butter is safe. ""ConAgra Foods, the maker of Peter Pan Peanut Butter, has confirmed that none of the ingredients used to make Peter Pan Peanut Butter come from Peanut Corporation of America, the company linked to the government's current salmonella investigation,"" the letter says. ""We are extremely confident in the safety protocols."" J.M. Smucker, maker of Jif peanut butter, had a similar message for customers. ""Our Smucker's peanut butter brand and peanut butter products are safe for consumption. The J.M. Smucker Company does not purchase peanuts or any ingredients from Peanut Corporation of America,"" its Web site says. The Peanut Corporation of America is under investigation by the Food and Drug Administration, and the FBI searched its Blakely, Georgia, plant on Monday, CNN affiliate WALB-TV in Albany, Georgia, reported. Americans have shied away from peanut butter despite the FDA's assurances that major-label peanut butter in grocery stores is safe.  Watch a senator express outrage at the outbreak » . ""With eight dead and almost 600 sick, it's a time to be prudent,"" said Dr. Douglas Powell, an associate professor of food safety at Kansas State University, which is the home of the International Food Safety Network. There's another problem, Powell said: ""None of these companies are really coming out and saying this is what we do to ensure safety. They say, 'Yeah, we test for salmonella.' But are those tests public? They're not."" Shoppers are wary because they don't know which products are safe, he said. Tainted peanut butter and peanut paste were shipped by Peanut Corporation of America to institutions such as schools, nursing homes and prisons, not to grocery stores. But that isn't preventing consumers from playing it safe. Powell said he understands. ""If you're a parent packing a lunch and you have all the hectic things going on in the morning, is it really realistic to say, hey, before you put that peanut snack cracker individually wrapped item into your kid's lunch, you're going to go onto the Internet and check a Web site? I think that's a bit much. I think it's prudent to avoid this stuff until we see where this is going,"" he said.","Makers of Peter Pan and Jif distance firms from salmonella contamination .

1788,"New York (CNN) -- Most people toss out their busted umbrellas after a strong storm rips them apart. But for Catherine Charlot, these broken remnants are true treasures. After rainy weather hits New York City, Charlot takes to the streets collecting umbrellas from roads, subway stations and trash cans. Then she totes them back to her Brooklyn studio and transforms them from trash into fashion. Her unique pieces are anything but shabby. Charlot creates chic cocktail dresses, tote bags and dog clothes from umbrella material and other recycled fabrics for her clothing line Himane. She has even made a wedding dress using 15 white umbrellas. After watching the film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" Charlot was inspired to make her own version of the little black dress, thinking, ""I really love that black dress, but I don't want to do the same kind of little black dress. What about I try something out of umbrellas? ""And I took 3 umbrellas and I designed a beautiful gown."" Wet-weather months provide an abundance of fabric for Charlot. ""In March, during the rainy month, I collected 237 umbrellas,"" she said. The job can lead to interesting situations. One woman who came across Charlot digging deep in a trash can mistook her for a homeless person and offered her lunch. But Charlot doesn't mind. She believes she is helping to reduce the amount of garbage on the streets. ""I think I'm doing a lot. I'm helping a lot because all those umbrellas and all those fabrics are going to end up in a landfill."" Her creations are mostly sold online. The umbrella dresses start at $200, dog clothes are $40, and purses are about $150. It's fashion for a good cause. Charlot says 10 percent of every sale she makes will go to a school she is building in her home country of Haiti. The school, Charlot said, will be ""something young kids can just go and learn something positive, learn how to recycle, how to do something with their hands, and be useful for tomorrow."" Charlot believes she is making a difference at home, too. ""By purchasing and buying one dress, a bag made out of a recycled umbrella, right there you're showing your support, you're doing something that is right, that is good for the environment, for you, for your kids, or for everybody,"" she said. Meanwhile, Charlot is committed to braving the rainy New York City streets on the hunt for trashed umbrellas.

1789,"(CNN) -- An explosion occured late Monday morning at the Fukushima Daiichi's No. 3 nuclear reactor building, a government official told reporters. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said that the head of the nuclear plant reports that the container vessel, surrounding the reactor, remains intact. Japanese public broadcaster NHK showed images of white smoke rising above the facility, which is in northeastern Japan. Citing the nation's nuclear and industrial agency, NHK said that a wall of one of the reactor's buildings had collapsed. The 600 residents remaining within 20 kilometers of the plant, despite an earlier evacuation order, have been ordered to stay indoors, according to Edano. The secretary added that initial reports suggested that radiation levels had increased after the blast. But Edano said he did not believe there was a massive leak, given that water continues to be injected into the reactors and that the pressure inside the reactor is ""within a certain range."" ""We are now collecting information on the concentration of radiation,"" Edano said. The facility is in the area of northeast Japan devasted by last week's earthquake and tsunami.","The explosion occurred late Monday morning at the Fukushima #3 reactor building .

1790,"Seattle (CNN) -- Even as snowfall slowed Wednesday in the Pacific Northwest, officials warned that falling temperatures would make roads icy and dangerous for drivers. ""We are seeing multiple spinouts and collisions,"" the Washington State Department of Transportation reported on its website, advising drivers to slow down as road conditions worsened. Some normally busy streets in Seattle looked more like ski runs, as residents with sleds and snowboards took advantage of what could be one of the area's largest snowfalls in decades. The National Weather Service canceled a winter storm warning for the area Wednesday afternoon, but said a winter weather advisory would remain in effect until midnight. Light snowfall was expected to continue throughout the evening. High-wind warnings were in effect along the coast, where winds could gust to hurricane force, knocking down trees and causing power outages, said CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. Wednesday's snowfall in Seattle may equal its annual average, Ward said. CNN affiliate KOMO showed images of overturned vehicles and carports and awnings that collapsed under the weight of the snow. Precipitation moving in from the south and west is combining with cold air moving south from Canada to create the heavy snowfall, said Dustin Guy, a meteorologist at the weather service's Seattle office. If snowfall amounts top 7 inches, the winter weather event will rank among Seattle's 10 worst since the early 1940s, when record-keeping began, he added. A series of severe winter storms and record-breaking cold also hit the region in the 1950s, according to CNN affiliate KOMO. While that amount of snow is no problem in places that receive snow regularly, heavy snowfall is relatively rare in Seattle, where steep hills can make winter travel treacherous. ""This city shuts down when winter hits. It's nuts. ... This city is just so unprepared for snow,"" Derek Stanek, 25, told CNN's iReport. Are you there? Share your photos and video . Nevertheless, city officials maintained they were ready for the storm. Deicing measures were in place on bridges and overpasses, emergency shelters were opened, schools were closed and some flights were canceled. Using a ruler outside his home near Tacoma, Washington, Joel Pederson measured 6 inches of snow Wednesday. And it was still coming down, Pederson told CNN's iReport. ""We have not had this much snow since the 1980s,"" he said. Official snow measurements for the day were not expected until Thursday morning. But Washington's capital, Olympia, had already received 13 inches of snow by Wednesday afternoon: the third highest 24-hour snowfall on record and the largest amount of snow that had fallen there since 1972, when 14.2 inches of snow fell in one day. As of late Wednesday morning, the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport had received 4 inches of snow, with 4.7 inches measured in Tacoma, as the second of twin winter storms moved through, according to the National Weather Service . Up to 8 inches of snow was forecast for the metropolitan area. The town of Winlock, Washington, about 105 miles south of Seattle, had received 16 inches by late Wednesday morning, the weather service said. The town of Chehalis, about 18 miles north of Winlock, had 14 inches. Mountainous areas of the Pacific Northwest will see even more snow, with the largest accumulations on the eastern slopes of the Cascades, according to the weather service. Significant snowfall is expected across southern Washington, northwest Oregon and into western Idaho. From late Tuesday through early Thursday, 2 feet to 3.5 feet of snow is forecast for the mountains east of Seattle, Guy said. Mount Rainier could see 10 feet of snow by Friday. However, the snow in Portland, Oregon, had changed into heavy rain Wednesday morning as warm air intruded into the area. The city was under a flood advisory because of the rain and melting snow, the weather service said. High winds were also forecast for the area. At Otter Rock, on the central Oregon coast, a gust of 110 mph was recorded, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris reported, along with gusts topping 80 mph at Lincoln City and Florence. The first storm moved into the area Monday and Tuesday. ""It's pretty big when you get back-to-back storms like that,"" weather service meteorologist Roger Cloutier said. Winter storm warnings Wednesday touched portions of eight states, stretching into Montana, Utah and Wyoming. The snowfall extends south into Oregon, with as much as 18 inches forecast for the Bend area. CNN affiliate KTVZ in Bend said an earlier round of snow over the weekend gave a boost to local ski resorts but also created dangerous driving conditions that left at least one motorist dead. Those conditions were expected to worsen. ""Expect extreme travel difficulties to develop on Wednesday,"" the weather service said, advising those who must take to the roads during the storm to carry a flashlight, blankets and extra food and water. The Washington State Department of Transportation said 1,250 workers will use nearly 500 pieces of equipment statewide to treat and plow roadways. The heavy snowfall will be followed by rain in Seattle, which could produce accumulated water and urban flooding, Guy said. ""It's just gonna be a mess all around,"" he said of the coming few days in the Seattle area. CNN's Thelma Gutierrez, Brad Lendon, Sean Morris and Christina Zdanowicz contributed to this report.","NEW: Officials say falling temperatures will make roads dangerous for drivers .

1791,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It doesn't have the brutality of rugby or the physical intimidation of a boxing match, yet sailing is still one of the most dangerous sports in the world. Capsized: This French catamaran flipped near New Zealand while attempting to win the Jules Verne Trophy. This danger is never more evident than in the epic Volvo Ocean Race. The round-the-world event which begins this month in Alicante, Spain, always throws up its fair share of drama as the crews face all types of conditions right through to the race finish around July 2009. To give an idea of the extreme dangers this year's crews will face over the coming nine months, here is a look at some of the worst tragedies to strike yacht racing. There's no question about it: this is no sport for the faint-hearted. September 2008 Régates Royales-Trophée Panerai Death toll: One . Wilfrid Tolhurst was killed during the famous Régates Royales-Trophée Panerai yacht race off Cannes that sees the major classic yachts in the Mediterranean gather. Skippering the eight-meter yacht, Safir, in the coastal race, Tolhurst was struck by the boat's falling mast that broke off under the impact of a collision with another boat, Rowdy. Although rescue crews reacted quickly to bring the skipper ashore, nothing could be done to save his life. A police inquiry is currently in progress to determine the cause of the incident. September 2008 Sean Whiston Perpetual Cup Race Death toll: One . Kenneth Jones (46) lost his life while sailing in a race from Wicklow to the Poolbeg Yacht Club in Dublin, Ireland. It was not clear what caused the incident, however, a mayday was issued by the yacht Allanah, stating that there was 'a man in the water.' Jones was lifted from the water and transferred to Tallaght Hospital where he later died. May 2006 Volvo Ocean Race Death toll: One . During the seventh leg of the race Hans Horrevoets, 32, of The Netherlands was swept overboard from ABN Amro Two in heavy seas. Although he was recovered from the water, attempts to resuscitate him were not successful. The savage storm that hit the fleet could easily have claimed more lives.

1793,"(CNN) -- Just weeks before a Continental Connection commuter plane crashed near Buffalo, another airline had reminded its pilots about safety issues with instrument approaches at the airport. Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. However, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday said it was extremely unlikely the February 12 crash and the warning were related. Instrument approaches are those in which pilots use cockpit displays to line up their aircraft with the runway when visibility is low. The alert, initially issued by Southwest Airlines and reissued Wednesday by the airline's pilot association, warned there was a ""potentially significant hazard"" concerning the instrument landing system's glide slope guidance signal for runway 23. The airline advised, ""Pilots who are preparing to configure and land have the potential to experience abrupt pitch up, slow airspeed, and approach to stall if conditions present themselves in a certain manner."" Southwest Airlines spokesperson Linda Rutherford said an earthen dam at the end of the runway was interfering with the signal being sent to inbound flights. Rutherford would not confirm if any of Southwest's recent flights into Buffalo experienced problems on approach. ""We often put out alerts on obstructions to a navigation aid,"" Rutherford told CNN. She also pointed out, though landing on the same runway, Southwest Airlines flights approach runway 23 from the north, turning right, while the Colgan Air flight that crashed was approaching from the south turning left. Rutherford called that distinction important.  View a Google Earth image of runway 23 » . The National Transportation Safety Board told CNN the agency was ""aware"" of the Southwest Airlines alert, but would not comment further. The issue is caused by a geographic feature at the airport, a valley, ""something we can't do anything about,"" said FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown. She said the ""altitude reading makes it look like you're a lot higher than you are, because there is a valley there."" The feature has been noted on FAA charts for years, she said. ""As far as we can tell, there is no way this had any role in the accident,"" Brown told CNN. ""It's not a navigation aid that would have applied to the approach."" The alert from Southwest Airlines advises pilots that the problem could cause the planes navigational system to interpret data ""in such a way as to result in a nose-up pitch and loss of airspeed."" Flight data recorders obtained by the NTSB of the crashed Colgan air Flight 3407 show during its approach to runway 23, the twin turbo prop Dash-8 pitched up 31 degrees before going into a stall due to lack of airspeed. Southwest Airlines Pilot Association told its pilots the ""issue is being addressed on several levels in an attempt to address procedures, facilities, and communication regarding this matter."" The alert advises any pilots experience trouble to contact the association's safety office.","NEW: FAA spokeswoman says it doesn't appear issue was related to crash .

1794,"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- More than 100 people were injured when a strong earthquake shook coastal Peru early Monday, civil defense officials said. The magnitude 6.3 quake hit about 15 kilometers (9 miles) southeast of Ica, at a depth of 39.2 kilometers (24.4 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Civil defense officials reported that 119 people were injured and 40 homes were either damaged or destroyed. Power was temporarily down in parts of Ica, they said. State-run TV Peru reported that police were patrolling the area while officials assessed damages. A 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck the same region in October, leveling dozens of buildings and leaving some homeless. In 2007, an 8.0-magnitude quake struck southwestern Peru, killing more than 500 people and injuring more than 1,000. The most serious damage from that quake occurred in towns and cities along the country's Pacific coast south of Lima, including Chincha, Canete, Pisco and Ica.

1795,"(CNN) -- A small central Texas community has begun trucking in thousands of gallons of water to avoid running dry during the state's historic drought, a water official said. Two trucks filled with about 8,000 gallons of water reached Spicewood Beach Monday afternoon and the precious liquid was immediately pumped into community water tanks. ""The community could be trucking for two weeks or two months, it just depends on the weather,"" according to Lower Colorado River Association spokeswoman Clara Tuma. ""It's raining right now, though."" The town is under a Stage 4 water emergency -- the most severe level -- and it won't ease until the town gets more rain over an extended period of time. ""The water supply is dangerously low"" in the community of 1,100 about 35 miles northwest of Austin, Tuma said. The town sits on Lake Travis and is popular among retirees and people who own lake houses or second homes. The water level in the Spicewood well has leveled out since the water emergency was declared last week. ""All outdoor watering is now prohibited and customers are strongly urged to cut out all nonessential use of water immediately,"" the company said in a news release on January 24. Officials believe conservation by the community has helped. Residents are only supposed to be using water for bathing, cooking and drinking. Besides trucking in water, the LCRA is looking at other alternatives for water, including digging another well, Tuma said. The Spicewood Beach Regional Water System is served by a single well after three other wells in the community were shut down in recent years. ""We're going to run out of water,"" resident Joe Barberra told CNN affiliate YNN Austin. ""Something should have been done a long time ago ... They waited too long. Now we're in this predicament."" The dry spell began in 2010 and is the worst the state has seen since 1895, Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst has said. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","Spicewood Beach may need supplemental water for several months, official says .

1796,"(CNN) -- A fire broke out inside the reactor building at a nuclear power plant on France's northern coast, but there were no injuries or release of radiation, French utility EDF reported Thursday. The cause of the blaze in Unit 2 of the Penly nuclear power plant, near the English Channel port of Dieppe, was still under investigation, EDF said. The fire was extinguished Thursday afternoon, and inspectors were inside the unit, the company said. The reactor shut down automatically when the fire broke out, and regional authorities were notified immediately, EDF said. Nuclear power provides more than three-quarters of France's electricity. The two pressurized-water reactors at Penly, designed by the French nuclear company Areva, went online in the early 1990s.","The cause of the fire at the Penly nuclear plant is under investigation .

1797,"(CNN) -- A small amount of radioactive gas escaped from a steam generator at Southern California's San Onofre nuclear power plant during a water leak, but there was no threat to public health, federal regulators said Wednesday. Operators shut down the plant's No. 3 reactor on Tuesday after the water leak was discovered, Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Victor Dricks said. The gas was vented from the steam generator into an auxiliary building, where it triggered a radiation monitor, he said. The amount of gas that leaked was not immediately known, but it was a small amount that won't endanger the public or plant workers, Dricks said. He said the water leak was about six-hundredths of a gallon per minute, far below the levels required to declare an ""unusual event"" -- the lowest of four NRC alert levels. NRC inspectors will conduct a follow-up review of the incident, Dricks said. The plant's owner, Southern California Edison, reported the problem Tuesday, but had no new comment on Wednesday. The water leak occurred in the thousands of tubes that carry heated water from the reactor core through the steam generator, a 65-foot-tall, 640-ton piece of equipment that boils water used to drive the unit's turbines. Though leaking tubes periodically occur in older units, Dricks said, Southern California Edison replaced the steam generators at San Onofre between 2009 and 2011. CNN's Karan Olson and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","A small amount of radioactive gas escaped from a steam generator, the NRC says .

1798,"New York (CNN) -- Firefighters continue to battle a series of brushfires raging on nearly 2,600 acres in the U.S. Northeast, which officials say were triggered by high winds and dry conditions. Parts of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have been issued warnings by the National Weather Service after a recent dry spell in the region. New York . Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday declared a state of emergency for New York's Suffolk County, where a 1,000-acre blaze broke out Monday. The declaration makes the county eligible for financial assistance. ""It could have been a lot worse,"" he said. The fire began in the area surrounding the Brookhaven National Laboratory, according to County Executive Steven Bellone. The fire continued to rage into Tuesday morning and prompted Suffolk County officials to ask for the emergency declaration, he said during a news conference Tuesday. ""We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to get the fire under control before winds pick up again,"" he said. Two firefighters were released from a hospital Monday with minor injuries, and a third suffered second- and third-degree burns after winds fanned flames in a wooded area where he was working, Bellone said. The injured firefighter, who was taken to Stony Brook University Hospital, is ""doing well"" and ""in good spirits,"" he added. State officials planned water drops Tuesday from a helicopter in an attempt to control the flames, said Jerry Hauer, New York's commissioner of homeland security and emergency services. The National Guard is also on standby in the event that the fire worsens, he said. Homes in Brookhaven and Riverhead, Long Island, were evacuated Monday, and residents were still unable to return as of Tuesday morning, Bellone said. Three homes were destroyed in the fire. The Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island was also hit hard by a five-alarm fire Monday. Four firefighters suffered minor injuries while fighting the blaze, authorities said. The fire was first called in about 11 a.m. Monday, and 168 firefighters were sent to the scene. The fire was under control by around 4 a.m. Tuesday, but firefighters remained at the scene through the morning, officials said. No homes were evacuated. New Jersey . In New Jersey, a wildfire that sprawled across about 1,000 acres of rural forest at its peak had been about 75% contained as of Tuesday, according to Michael Achey, the state's Forest Fire Service spokesman. The flames were reported just after midnight Monday and spread rapidly in Tabernacle and Woodland townships in Burlington County, New Jersey. ""We had a very strong wind yesterday, and that fanned the blaze,"" Achey said. ""The conditions are a little bit better today, but they are still calling for a strong westerly wind."" Twenty-five homes are in the fire area, Achey said, but no homes were evacuated. No injuries have been reported, and the fire remains under investigation, he added. Connecticut . A 60-acre fire in Milford, Connecticut, was about 90% contained Tuesday, according to Chris Zak, a Milford Fire Department spokesman. Two buildings were evacuated, but residents were allowed back into their homes Monday night. The flames whipped through northern parts of Milford -- a wooded, marshy area with very few buildings, Zak said. No injuries were reported. He said his department is accustomed to marsh fires, but Monday's blaze was on a different scale. ""This was a fast-moving brushfire, so it's something we're not used to,"" Zak said. ""The guys did a fantastic job."" By Tuesday morning, firefighters were still at the scene. ""We're aggressively attacking it,"" Zak said. ""It's still windy out here today, so we don't want anything to flare up or rekindle."" Pennsylvania . In southeast Pennsylvania, a blaze that spread over 450 acres at its worst point was about 95% contained Tuesday, said Joe Frassetta, district forester at the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry. Firefighters from 30 different companies fought the fire, which raged in French Creek State Park in Berks County, through Monday night and into Tuesday. Residents of more than 100 homes along the border of the park were evacuated Monday. Flames came within 100 yards of several homes but did not cause any structural damage, Frassetta said. ""For this area of Pennsylvania, this is about as bad as it gets,"" he said. A second, smaller fire in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, was about 90% contained as of Tuesday. Despite several smaller overnight fires, rainfall helped keep the brush blaze in check, said Duane Hagelgans, a regional emergency management spokesman. The 30-acre fire began in a private logging area on Peter's Mountain, Hagelgans said. No homes were evacuated, but volunteer firefighters battled both the blaze and rough, mountainous terrain, which hampered efforts to contain the spreading fire. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries, Hagelgans said. ""The winter hurt us because its been very dry,"" he said. ""There are a lot of leaves on the ground.""

1799,"New Delhi (CNN) -- At least 435 patients, mostly children, have died this year from encephalitis in one of India's most impoverished regions, health officials said. Most of the deaths happened between August and September, according to K.P. Kushwaha, chief pediatrician at BRD Medical College and Nehru Hospital in Uttar Pradesh state's Gorakhpur district. Some 30 to 35 people are being diagnosed daily with the infection in Gorakhpur, he said. The outbreaks are common in the district, near India's border with Nepal. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain, primarily caused by food and drink contamination and mosquito bites. The very young and the elderly are more likely to have a severe case, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. As many as 500 people died last year in the region from the disease, Kushwaha said. In 2009, India reported 774 fatalities from encephalitis, including 556 in Uttar Pradesh, federal data shows.","Some 30 to 35 people are being diagnosed daily with the infection in the Gorakhpur district .

1800,"(CNN) -- A sharp increase in the number of reported cases of the H1N1 virus in Australia may prompt the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the first global pandemic in over forty years. Australian rugby league star Karmichael Hunt is one of several players being tested for the H1N1 virus. The number of Australian cases of the virus, commonly known as swine flu, has reached more than 1,200, with state and federal medical officers set to hold an emergency meeting in Sydney to review the country's swine flu protection measures. ""We will take each decision along the way in response to the expert medical advice,"" Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). On Wednesday it was announced that the entire Brisbane Broncos rugby league squad had been placed into quarantine after one of their players was suspected of having the virus. The Queensland club confirmed on its Web site that full-back Karmichael Hunt was being tested for the virus, while the sport's governing body, the National Rugby League (NRL), said Hunt had tested positive for the common flu, influenza A. With over 26,000 H1N1 cases worldwide, the WHO could move to Phase 6, the highest on its pandemic alert system. ""It's really a matter of making sure that countries are prepared as possible. We do not want people to overly panic,"" Keiji Fukuda, WHO's Assistant Director General, told ABC. In a statement a day earlier, Fukuda said the WHO had been working extremely hard preparing countries for what a potential move to a global pandemic would entail. ""I want to point out that by going to Phase 6 the activity has become established in at least two regions of the world,"" he said. ""It does not mean that the severity of the situation has increased and that people are getting seriously sick at higher numbers or higher rates than they are right now.""","Australian cases of the H1N1 virus reach more than 1,200 .

1801,"Kennesaw, Georgia (CNN) -- It was the most famous high-speed chase of its day. The pursuers didn't have flashing blue lights. They couldn't swing around and cut off the hijacked vehicle. But they didn't have to. The locomotive General weighed more than 20 tons and was confined to a single iron track between Atlanta, Georgia, and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Its top speed was about 70 miles per hour, it had no brakes, and it eventually ran out of fuel. However, ""The Great Locomotive Chase,"" which occurred 150 years ago Thursday, made heroes of Union soldiers and civilians -- who tried to put a critical railroad line out of commission during the Civil War -- and the Southern train crews and troops who pursued them. Several members of the raiding party were the first to receive the new Medal of Honor. The suburban Atlanta town where the chase began and other Georgia communities along the 80-mile route this week are commemorating the wild, failed escapade immortalized in two movies. ""It's the greatest war story ever told,"" said Jere Martin, 60, of Atlanta, as he prepared Thursday to enter Kennesaw's Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History, which houses the General. ""It's a classic tale of daring versus persistence."" Civilian leader James J. Andrews and his band of raiders boarded the General in nearby Marietta, bent on damaging the Western & Atlantic Railroad line as well as Confederate communications as they rushed northward to Chattanooga. ""The whole thing was snake-bit from the start,"" said Russell S. Bonds, author of the 2006 book ""Stealing the General: The Great Locomotive Chase and the First Medal of Honor."" ""Two raiders overslept and missed the train, and there was bad (rail) traffic and weather,"" Bonds said. On the morning of April 12, 1862, as the General made a breakfast stop in Big Shanty (present-day Kennesaw), Andrews' men unhooked passenger cars and sped away. Stunned conductor William A. Fuller, thinking Confederate draftees at a camp in Big Shanty might have commandeered the General, literally ran after his train. He came across a handcar and cranked it until he found a train that could follow the General. Confederate horsemen eventually joined the madcap pursuit. As Fuller kept the heat on and changed trains, Andrews' colleagues made two small breaks in the track and cut telegraph wires. Andrews, who thought any pursuit had been stalled, was nearly caught in the town of Kingston, but continued on to a spot near Ringgold, where the General ran out of wood and water as the Texas closed in -- about seven hours after the caper began. That is when he is reported to have said, ""Every man for himself!"" The raiders jumped off, but were rounded up. The cost for taking part in the sabotage attempt was high. Andrews and seven other captured participants were subsequently hanged as spies. A dozen others escaped or were exchanged. Besides the General, the dogged chase involved, in order, pursuing locomotives Yonah, William R. Smith and the Texas. Remarkably, the Texas also survives. Its role often is overlooked. The locomotive, which operated in reverse during its portion of the chase, is housed at the Atlanta Cyclorama & Civil War Museum. ""When the Texas got in the race, it was a duel between evenly matched locomotives,"" Bonds told CNN. Some consider the hijacking of the General as the Doolittle Raid of its time: An attempt to boost morale and throw a little scare into the enemy. ""It's not a military battle,"" said Richard Banz, executive director of the Kennesaw museum. ""This is an ingenious concept of 'let's go 200 miles behind enemy lines.' "" In the end, however, Andrews and his saboteurs did little damage and failed to burn a vital bridge. Kennesaw, Marietta and other cities along the chase route, which now parallels Interstate 75 in northern Georgia, are sponsoring a range of events through the weekend, including tours, music, living histories and the screenings of two movies about the Andrews raid: Buster Keaton's silent comedy ""The General"" (1927) and Walt Disney's ""The Great Locomotive Chase"" (1956), starring Fess Parker. On Thursday, the General was festooned with red, white and blue bunting as museum visitors took photos and learned more about regional railroad history. It saw service until the early 1960s. Most of its parts, including the smokestack, have been replaced or modified. The wheels and axle are believed to be original. The episode proved the importance of railroads in the war and society, Bonds said. The line is still in operation today, serving as a busy CSX Transportation freight artery. And the chase continues to capture the imagination. ""It is like the Dirty Dozen, the Great Train Robbery and the Great Escape all rolled into one,"" Bonds said.","150 years ago Thursday, Union raiders stole a train in Georgia .

1802,"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Three people were killed and seven others injured, two of the seriously, when an improvised explosive device went off Monday near government offices here. It is unclear who is behind the blast, a rare occurrence in the Himalayan capital, although a previously unknown group, United Ethnic Liberation Front, has claimed responsibility, police Officer Dhiraj Singh said. ""We cannot verify that as we are still investigating,"" Singh said. No arrests have been made so far. The explosion happened outside a court house and less than 200 meters from the Central Secretariat, which houses most government ministries. Two people died on the spot while third died while undergoing treatment at hospital. All 10 victims are men. As Nepal prepares a new republican constitution and adopts a federal model, various ethnic groups in a population of about 27 million are demanding special rights and calling for provinces based on ethnicity.","Bombing occurs near central secretariat in Nepal's capital .

1803,"(CNN) -- Rescuers were searching Friday for nearly 120 people unaccounted for after a passenger ferry sank off the east coast of Papua New Guinea, authorities said. The 238 known survivors arrived by five vessels at the city of Lae. Many were undergoing medical tests, according to Capt. Nurur Rahman, rescue coordinator with the country's National Maritime Safety Authority. About 350 people were aboard the MV Rabaul Queen when it sank Thursday, said Rahman. The MV Rabaul Queen went down about 16 kilometers (10 miles) off Cape Fortification in the Vitiaz Strait after getting into trouble early Thursday, officials said. The ferry is about 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) below the surface, Rahman said. After an alert was sent out, boats and helicopters rushed to the scene to try to save scores of people left adrift at sea by the sinking. They had to deal with high winds and ocean swells. Joanne Meehan of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority told CNN two of that country's aircraft were assisting in the search. Australia is Papua New Guinea's closest neighbor minus Indonesia, with which it shares a border. ""I'm pleased that a large number of people have been rescued,"" said Kevin Rudd, the Australian foreign minister. ""We're deeply concerned about those who are still missing."" Rudd said he didn't have any information on the nationalities of the passengers aboard the ship. ""This is a difficult operating environment,"" he said. ""We are doing everything within our power."" The Rabaul Queen was ferrying passengers from the town of Kimbe on New Britain Island to Lae when it got into difficulty. ""Taking ferries is the most economic method of transport for people traveling between the islands and the mainland,"" Rahman told CNN. ""What I understand from local media is that a lot of students and their parents were traveling to schools that recently reopened on the mainland."" Jurgen Ruh, the chief executive of Manolos Aviation Ltd. in Lae, was in one of the helicopters that helped with the rescue effort. ""I could see the survivors on the debris,"" he said, noting that the passenger ship had sunk completely by the time he reached the scene. There were about 10 life rafts visible, each with roughly 10 people on them, the first time his helicopter flew overhead, he said. However, when the helicopter returned to the area after refueling, no more survivors were spotted. The weather was likely to be a contributing factor in the ferry's sinking, Ruh said, as there were high winds at the time in what is a notorious area. Papua New Guinea had a population of 6.7 million in 2010, the U.S. State Department says, with about 190,000 people living in Lae. Most of the population is scattered in small settlements across the state's many islands. The largely Christian country is part of the Commonwealth and has Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. The bulk of the estimated 2,000 American residents in Papua New Guinea, are missionaries and their families, the State Department says. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, Karen Smith, Jethro Mullen, Phil Gast, Laura Smith-Spark and Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","NEW: Vessel is about 3,280 feet below the surface .

1804,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Questions swirled Sunday about what caused iconic singer Whitney Houston's sudden death, with authorities offering little information at a time when many were still struggling to come to grips with the news. While an autopsy was complete as of late Sunday afternoon, Assistant Chief Ed Winter of the Los Angeles County Coroner's office said it could take six to eight weeks before the results are in on toxicology and other tests. ""There was no visible signs of trauma, and foul play is not suspected at this time,"" Winter said, adding that ""the cause of death right now is deferred."" More official details on the investigation aren't expected to surface anytime soon, after the Beverly Hills, California, police department was granted a ""security hold."" Common in high-profile cases, this puts limits on what can be revealed about a probe. Authorities have said that police and fire officials were called to Houston's room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel at 3:43 p.m. Saturday after her bodyguard found her unconscious body in a bathtub. Winter, from the coroner's office, said Houston was removed from the tub before paramedics performed CPR. She was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m. Pill bottles were found at the scene, entertainment news website TMZ reported, citing ""informed sources."" CNN could not immediately confirm the TMZ report and Winter declined to comment. Whatever the exact cause, the grief about the death of Houston -- whose soaring voice and enormous talent were clouded in recent years by her battles with drug addiction -- was evident Sunday at the 54th annual Grammy awards show, which is typically the biggest night on the music industry's calendar. After a performance by Bruce Springsteen, Grammy host LL Cool J began his monologue by acknowledging ""we've had a death in our family"" and offering a prayer thanking God ""for sharing our sister Whitney with us."" ""Although she's gone too soon, we remain truly blessed to have been touched by her beautiful spirit and to have her lasting legacy of music to cherish and share forever,"" the rapper and actor said. Earlier, on the red carpet, Kim Burrell told CNN she'd exchanged voicemails with her good friend Houston shortly before her death, describing her as being ""in great spirits, as always."" She always thought of Houston as a ""fighter"" and a ""survivor,"" which made the idea of her passing all the more difficult to comprehend. ""She's my sister and she'll always be my sister,"" said an emotional Burrell, herself a singer. ""I love her dearly."" Burrell said she'd flown to California to join Houston in attending a pre-Grammy party Saturday night hosted by the songstress' longtime mentor, Clive Davis. Houston never made it, dying at the age of 48. Amid the outpouring of grief, Beverly Hills police said Houston's 18-year-old daughter, Bobbi Kristina, was taken to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, at about 11:15 a.m. Sunday. Details of her condition were not disclosed. A source close to the family told CNN that by late Sunday afternoon the teenager was out of the hospital and would be heading back to New Jersey possibly as early as Sunday night. She was expected to go to the home of her grandmother, gospel singer Cissy Houston, in New Jersey, the source said. Bobbi Kristina Brown was born during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. Burrell said she was with the teenager late Saturday, admitting the girl had felt ""overwhelmed"" while expressing confidence that ""she'll pull through."" Her father, Bobby Brown, did not perform at a scheduled New Edition concert Sunday night in Nashville in the wake of his ex-wife's death, said Candy Lowd, a promoter for the concert. The previous night, he was openly emotional during a concert in Southaven, Mississippi, said attendee and CNN iReporter Moshiu Knox, at one point asking people to say a prayer for his daughter, for his mother and ""for me, because I'm going to need it."" ""Bobby was crying during his performance and at one point had to walk off stage,"" Knox said. Houston's battles with drugs had long made headlines, but she was in the midst of a comeback, with a few shows scheduled and a movie in the works. ""I did really get the sense that she was really trying to make a comeback,"" megachurch pastor T.D. Jakes, executive producer of Houston's upcoming movie ""Sparkle,"" said Sunday. ""And I think that the reason that so many people are devastated is because it is not just her music, but it is her misery that attached itself to the hearts of Americans, and we watched her struggle to regain her footing after a tumultuous relationship and bouts with abuse and substance abuse. ""I think the believability of her human struggle made her song and her acting that much more powerful because we recognize that often it is the caged bird that sings,"" Jakes said. Fans: Houston's music spanned an era . A music industry executive, who recalled hearing two loud booms from the room below hers -- the room where, she later learned, Houston had died -- said she had seen Houston and Bobbi Kristina swimming in the hotel pool days before. The two looked happy, she recalled, and Houston seemed healthy and beautiful. However, it remained unknown whether the singer had won her battle with substance abuse for good. Houston had performed as late as Thursday night at a pre-Grammy event in the area, singing a raspy rendition of ""Jesus Loves Me"" with singer Kelly Price. Music exec: Houston looked 'healthy and beautiful' days earlier . Houston's family said in a statement Sunday, ""We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Whitney. This is an unimaginable tragedy and we will miss her terribly. We appreciate the outpouring of love and support from her fans and friends."" Grief flows at hotel where Houston died . Her fans remembered her in her prime on Sunday, when she reigned as pop queen during the 1980s, selling some 170 million albums, singles and videos. ""Perhaps now Whitney can rest in everlasting life without the harsh judgment that she felt in this world,"" said CNN iReporters Kimberly and Betty Kiel from Pearland, Texas. And in the church where Houston grew up, the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, members gathered to honor her. As a young girl, Houston grew sang solos in the choir at the church. Her mother served as director of sacred music at the church for 54 years and is still a member there. Whitney Houston was born in Newark in 1963 and was soloing in the junior choir by age 11, according to the All Music Guide. ""Whitney's mother and cousins nurtured her passion for gospel music since birth,"" according to Houston's official website. Her cousins include singers Dee Dee Warwick and Dionne Warwick, and her godmother was Aretha Franklin. Franklin told CNN on Sunday that the news of her goddaughter's death is ""almost unbelievable."" ""It's stunning, absolutely stunning,"" the iconic performer said. ""I could not believe what I was reading ... It's a sad day, a very sad day."" Sorrow at church where Houston got her start . The Rev. Jesse Jackson was among those attending the service in Newark. ""Whitney is a winner,"" he told reporters outside the church. ""Her singing, her inspiring people around the world, it's been a great source of joy and uplift. And so we grieve, and yet we rejoice even in our grieving."" Houston's career: A regal rise, a tragic fall . Jackson said he spoke to Cissy Houston on Saturday night and Sunday morning and headed to her home after the service. ""They're having to process this,"" he said of Houston's family. ""This was not some long, debilitating sickness. This was sudden. And so when this happens, there's no rational explanation, just you have to cling to your faith and hold on until the morning comes.""

1805,"(CNN) -- A series of viral outbreaks causing diarrhea and vomiting has affected scores of people in North Carolina in recent weeks, sickening them, but causing no fatalities, health officials there said Wednesday. Several health departments have reported multiple outbreaks, prompting officials to urge residents to take precautions to prevent possible exposure to the virus, which they identified as norovirus. The largest outbreak, with 135 cases traced to a single restaurant, was found in Catawba County, said Kelly Schermerhorn, a public information officer with the Catawba County Public Health Department. She said the cases were linked to the Harbor Inn Seafood Diner in Conover. The restaurant is about an hour northwest of Charlotte. Most of the complaints were from people who had eaten at the restaurant on January 13 or January 14 and became ill 12 to 24 hours after dining there, said the health department in a posting on its website. Health officials are calling about 100 Harbor Inn patrons in a case-control study to find out what they ate and how they may have become sick. ""We are not sure yet how it started,"" Harbor Inn Seafood Manager George Ciogas told CNN in a telephone interview. Following the initial report of illness, Catawba County Public Health's Environmental Health specialists said they conducted a thorough inspection of the restaurant and found no violations. ""There does not appear to be any concern about ongoing exposure to norovirus at Harbor Inn,"" said Doug Urland, health director of Catawba County Public Health Department, in a statement. ""A case-control study will give us and state health officials the ability to learn more about the nature of norovirus, how it spreads, and what steps may be available to help better prevent this type of illness in the future."" But health officials acknowledge they may never be able to track down the cause. ""The most important message we have right now is that people who are ill with vomiting or diarrhea should not work, go to school or attend day care while they are having symptoms,"" said Dr. Megan Davies, the state epidemiologist. ""Everyone needs to wash their hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water. This is the most effective way to protect yourself and others against norovirus, since hand sanitizers alone are not as effective against this hardy virus."" Common symptoms of norovirus infection include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some victims may have fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and a general sense of tiredness, it says on its website.

1806,"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- Authorities in Uganda were investigating the death of a U.S. reality television producer whose work included ""The Amazing Race"" and ""Whale Wars,'"" officials said Wednesday. Andrew Kaweesi, commander of the Kampala Metropolitan Police Force, said that, based on preliminary toxicology results, officials believe Jeff Rice died of a drug overdose. Kaweesi said he did not know what drug may have been involved. An official police statement will be issued Thursday, according to Kaweesi. Rice's body was found late last week in a hotel room, according to reports. Sally Blackman, Rice's wife and business partner, announced his death Sunday. ""Jeff was on a film production in Uganda and was doing what he loves. ... He was a true asset to the film industry worldwide and Africa was his 'home,'"" Blackman wrote. The nature of Rice's work in Kampala was not immediately known. Earlier Wednesday, Blackman wrote CNN in an e-mail that ""this is a tragic event and it is unbelievable to read the messages of how many lives (Rice) has positively influenced."" CNN was trying to contact her and other family members for comment, including their reaction to the assertion Rice died of an overdose. Rice is survived by daughters, ages 2 and 7. The U.S. Embassy in Uganda referred questions on the investigation to Kampala police. Rice, who also served as a production facilitator, and Blackman were co-owners of SB Productions in Durban, South Africa. Rice was a native of Oklahoma. He worked as a freelance facilitator for the latest season of CBS's ""The Amazing Race,"" which wrapped up shooting months ago. Rice was not working with the show at the time of his death. Bertram van Munster, co-creator and executive producer of ""The Amazing Race,"" said in a statement that the show's team ""is shocked and deeply saddened to learn of Jeff's untimely death. ... He was well liked and his work was highly respected."" Rice served as a production facilitator in 2010 for SyFy's ""Destination Truth,"" the show's executive producer said in a statement. Shooting took place in Madagascar and Namibia. He also assisted in production of ""Whale Wars"" for Animal Planet. ""(Jeff) became an absolute expert in how to do productions in countries all over the continent, from Tanzania to Madagascar,"" said Liz Bronstein, executive producer for Lizard Trading Co., which produces ""Whale Wars."" Rice ""was given a name by the Zulu people: Lengai, which means 'a gift from God."" I've never met anyone like Jeff. He made working in the toughest environments look effortless,"" Bronstein said in a statement. Bronstein said Rice wrote her e-mails last week from Uganda indicating he planned to be in the country through mid-March. Journalist Gregory Branch and CNN's Jennifer Wolfe and HLN's Anisa Husain contributed to this report.","NEW: ""The Amazing Race"" team is ""shocked"" and ""saddened""

1807,"(CNN) -- Australian authorities on Monday pleaded with hundreds of people who had chosen to remain in a town in the path of rising flood waters to vacate their homes. The level of the Balonne River in the town of St. George, in the eastern state of Queensland, swelled to 13.63 meters at lunchtime on Monday, breaking its previous record, and was expected to crest overnight above 14 meters. ""We can't and won't physically drag people out of their homes,"" Bob Atkinson, the Queensland police commissioner, said. ""But we repeat the request for people to leave their homes."" Queensland has been deluged with heavy rains over the past week even as some parts of the region are still struggling to recover from devastating floods that took place about a year ago. Thirty houses in St. George have already been inundated, according to Neil Roberts, the Queensland police and emergency services minister. ""We do expect this to rise as the waters head towards their peak,"" he said. The majority of St. George's roughly 3,000 residents have left the danger area, by both bus and aircraft, Roberts said. The authorities had already been using military helicopters and a C-130 cargo plane to airlift thousands of stranded Queensland residents to safety. Hundreds of people were taking shelter in evacuation centers Monday. Rescue workers on Sunday recovered the body of a woman who died trying to drive her pickup through flood waters, the authorities said. Jane Sheahan was swept away Friday in the town of Roma. Witnesses told CNN affiliate Nine Network that Sheahan managed to hand off her 7-year-old son, Darcy, to a would-be rescuer before she was swept away. The floods have already damaged hundreds of homes in Roma and another town, Mitchell, according to Roberts. In the neighboring state of New South Wales, thousands of people remained isolated Sunday despite reports of receding floodwaters in some areas.","The Balonne River in the town of St. George reaches record level and is expected to rise further .

1808,"(CNN) -- A burst of intense rain caused perilous flash flooding Monday in parts of Louisiana, spurring the rescues of hundreds -- from people marooned inside their homes to middle school students stranded on a bus. According to the National Weather Service, southern Louisiana was pelted with an estimated 15 inches of rain in six hours, with on-and-off rain continuing for hours after that. ""I'm 46 years old, native to this area, and have been through several hurricanes, and I've never seen anything like this,"" said Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office spokesman Kip Judice. Hours after the biggest pocket of rain hit, Judice said that 10 rescues were under way around 6:30 p.m. This is in addition to the more than 150 such operations that took place earlier to get people out of residences and cars. One of those involved 16 adolescents whose bus became stuck after more than 4 feet of water covered the road, said Judice. Boats and dump trucks were used to reach the children and bring them to safety. The town of Carencro was among the hardest hit communities in Lafayette Parish, according to Capt. Craig Stansbury, who is also from the Parish Sheriff's Office. He noted there were reports of water as high as 8 feet on some roadways. Stansbury said fire department vehicles, tractors and conventional boats and air boats were being used to reach those stranded in homes and cars. ""A lot of things that we have at our disposal, we're just going to go ahead and utilize,"" he said. ""Whatever it takes to get to the people."" One of the worst hit parts of the state was St. Landry Parish, where Government Administrative Director Jessie Bellard estimated 2,000 people had been affected so far. A state of emergency has been declared for the parish, though there are no known injuries or fatalities there or elsewhere. People were driving dump trucks to rescue residents who have flooding in their homes and can't get out. He said several minor and major roads, including part of U.S. Highway 190, have experienced significant flooding. ""It's just a terrible situation,"" said Bellard. Maj. Ginny Higgins of the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office said at least 15 to 20 roads were affected by flooding Monday in that parish. Several people were safely rescued after being trapped in their vehicles, she said. A state of emergency has been declared for that parish, Higgins said. Stansbury, from Lafayette Parish, said residents knew Monday would be wet but didn't foresee the volume or intensity. ""There was a forecast of some heavy rains, but I don't think anybody could have predicted that amount of rain,"" he said. And while the worst precipitation is over, the headaches are not. Intermittent rain continued to fall Monday, with the National Weather Service issuing a flash flood warning for all or parts of the parishes of Allen, Evangeline, Acadia, Lafayette, St. Martin and St. Landry through 11:30 p.m. The agency called conditions ""dangerous ... with numerous roads and homes flooded."" Judice, from Lafayette Parish, said Monday evening that water levels were continuing to rise in his area. ""It's still a very crazy situation,"" he said.

1809,"(CNN) -- Coast Guard and Air National Guard crews spent a second day in search of four sailors from a yacht that ran aground off San Francisco over the weekend, the services said Sunday. At least one person died and three were rescued from the ""Low Speed Chase,"" Petty Officer 2nd Class Levi Read said. But the remaining four people aboard remained unaccounted for Sunday afternoon, and rescuers were searching a 15-by-30-mile patch of the Pacific Ocean in hopes of finding them alive. The 38-foot sailboat was taking part in a race around the Farallon Islands, 28 miles west of the Golden Gate Bridge. The vessel's skipper reported that the yacht was hit by a series of large waves that rolled it over, tossing several crew members overboard and running it aground, the Coast Guard said Sunday. The search effort included three helicopters, a C-130 transport and four Coast Guard vessels, including the cutters Aspen, Pike and Sockeye. The yacht was taking part in the Full Crew Farallon Race, a contest that dates to 1907, according to the San Francisco Yacht Club. In a statement on its website, the club said ""Low Speed Chase"" was one of its vessels and that it was awaiting news of the rescue effort. Late last month, the Coast Guard rescued racers taking part in an around-the-world contest when a giant wave damaged their yacht off the coast of San Francisco. The Geraldton Western Australia was on the sixth leg of an eight-leg, 11-month race when it was struck March 31.","NEW: The yacht was hit by several large waves, causing it to roll over, Coast Guard says .

1810,"(CNN)  -- Earthquake scientist James Roddey is known up and down the Oregon coast as the ""prophet of doom"" -- a nickname that seems even more ominous after the disaster in Japan.  As an earth science officer for the state, Roddey educates communities on how to prepare and survive the earthquake and tsunami that he predicts is virtually inevitable. ""They want to know more. They want to know what they can do,"" said Roddey, who spoke to CNN on Monday shortly before his scheduled appearance at an Oregon school near Gold Beach.   He's the bearer of bad news. Very bad news: there's a one-in-three chance that a major quake will strike the region by 2061, according to Oregon State University scientists. The risk lies along a fault line that extends near Newport, Oregon, to Northern California. Despite those odds, many Oregon coast residents are nonchalant about the threat of a catastrophe on the scale of the temblor that struck Japan last week. ""A lot of people don't even realize that we get earthquakes in Oregon,"" Roddey explained.  ""This used to be the place where Californians moved to get away from earthquakes."" As Japan reels from what its prime minister called its ""toughest crisis"" since World War II, emergency preparedness officials in the United States around the world are paying close attention. Friday's 9.0-magnitude quake was the strongest in recorded history to hit Japan, according to U.S. Geological Survey. ""What you are seeing in Japan today is what you will also see in our future,"" said Oregon State University geologist Robert Yeats. ""Except they're better prepared than we are."" Disaster preparations have been permanently imprinted on Japan's collective memory since the terrible Kanto earthquake in 1923 killed more than 140,000 people. The breathtaking damage from this most recent quake speaks to how bad the toll could have been -- if not for preparation. ""On a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the most prepared and zero being the worst-prepared ever, you can put Haiti at zero, you can put Japan at eight and you can put the U.S. at five,"" said Erwann Michel-Kerjan, managing director of the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at the Wharton School.   A nation's mindset surrounding disaster preparedness is directly linked to disaster frequency, say experts. But even in California, where so many quakes have occurred, less than 10% of residents have earthquake insurance, Michel-Kerjan said. Nuclear power plants . Last week's earthquake and subsequent tsunami triggered fires, explosions, and radiation leaks at Japan's nuclear power plants.  That has raised concerns of a far more dangerous radiation threat in Japan. It has also prompted a discussion in the United States and around the world about nuclear power safety. Some U.S. lawmakers are calling for new nuclear plant projects to be put on hold until regulations can be examined. The United States nuclear reactors operate at 65 plants across the country. In addition, there are dozens of reactors, weapons labs and other nuclear facilities associated with national defense. Most of the civilian plants are located near major population centers.  See locations of U.S. nuclear power facilities . There hasn't been a new nuclear plant commissioned and completed in the United States since the Three Mile Island meltdown in Pennsylvania in 1979, although dozens that were approved at the time have come on line. Federal regulators are reviewing 20 applications to build nuclear plants, and several existing facilities have applied to extend their operating licenses. Typically, nuclear power plants are designed to withstand natural disasters, including earthquakes. Perhaps the most vulnerable U.S. nuclear power plants are two located in the quake-prone state of California.  The Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo and the San Onofre station, north of San Diego, were built along Pacific coast near the San Andreas Fault. Opinion:  Japan and the future of U.S. nuclear power . Those plants were built to withstand a magnitude-7.5 earthquake, said Robert Alvarez, a nuclear expert at the Institute for Policy Studies and a former senior official at the U.S. Department of Energy. If there was a nuclear catastrophe, health officials warn that there are ""substantial gaps"" in how prepared the United States is for a ""major radiation emergency event,"" an American Medical Association journal reports "" Preparing for the tsunami threat . Back in Oregon, the shoreline community of Cannon Beach has proposed construction of a tall, reinforced municipal office building that would double as a tsunami shelter. ""You're looking at a $4 million building in a community that's only 1,700 people,"" said Roddey. ""A small community like that can't raise the money by themselves."" Cannon Beach is seeking federal money to help fund the project, which may include deep foundations and seawalls to protect against the ocean's crushing forces. Would U.S. taxpayers -- especially with the ongoing budget battles in Washington -- be willing to shell out more money to save lives and limit property damage from natural disasters? The world became acutely aware of the widespread damage a tsunami can cause in December 2004, when a massive quake triggered a wave that swept across the Indian Ocean, wiping out villages in several south Asian countries, killing over 200,000 people. Since then, Asia had taken big steps to improve its warning systems, the United Nations said. In the United States, budget cuts could directly effect the country's tsunami preparation system.  A spending plan passed last month by House Republicans allegedly would result in cuts to the National Weather Service's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Republicans deny their budget would specifically reduce the tsunami center. Whatever the case, some argue that cutting the center would be shortsighted. The American Society of Civil Engineers says that paying for resilient critical infrastructure before a disaster strikes saves money and lives in the long run, according to its 2008 report. ""Consider that an additional $2 billion investment in the levees surrounding New Orleans may have reduced the tragic loss of life caused by Hurricane Katrina,"" the report said. Making safer buildings and bridges . In Japan, engineers must adhere to strict construction codes aimed at making structures quake-resistant. ""The Japanese spend more of a premium on the construction of their buildings,"" said professor Stephen Mahin of the University of California, Berkeley. ""When you buy a condo in Japan, the owners and engineers will make a big point of the seismic safety of a building. Here in the United States, that kind of thing may not even be mentioned."" In the western United States, public buildings that are deemed critical have been strengthened against quakes in major cities from Seattle south to San Diego and east to Salt Lake City, he said. Major universities, including the University of California, have spent millions of dollars over the past 20 years upgrading their existing buildings, said Ronald Hamburger of the American Society of Civil Engineers. Private corporations that include AT&T, Hewlett-Packard, Procter & Gamble and Sears have spent significant money upgrading their buildings against quakes, he added. And, in California, nearly all of the state's bridges have been retrofitted for seismic resistance. ""We are far better off today than we were 20 years ago,"" said Hamburger. However, if a repeat of San Francisco's 1906 7.8-magnitude quake hits Los Angeles, San Francisco or Seattle, Hamburger said, ""I would not be surprised if one or two of the high-rise buildings in those cities would collapse."" Most of the high-rise office buildings built in those cities before the mid-1990s do not meet current standards for new construction, and most of them have not been upgraded, said Hamburger. ""Those buildings were designed in the 1960s, '70s and '80s,"" he said. ""The building codes in place in the Western U.S. in those years were far better than building code requirements in force in the Eastern U.S. today, but they're really not adequate for an event like what Japan experienced."" Risk to shipping ports . Key California shipping ports that lie in quake zones, such as Los Angeles, Long Beach and Oakland, may also be at risk, although a 2007 study suggested the danger from tsunamis was minimal because the major fault lines in the area are on shore. These ports represent major U.S. revenue arteries. But because many of the facilities at these ports were built in the 1960s and '70s, they could sustain damage from a big earthquake or tsunami, according to experts. Upgrading these facilities could cost in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. A Georgia Tech team of engineers, including professor Glenn Rix, is developing new, less expensive construction methods aimed at protecting shipping ports from possible destruction. Rix is studying the use of prefabricated plastic vertical drains in the wharf structure, which might allow for easier upgrades to protect against quakes. Raising awareness . After the Kanto earthquake, Japan established National Disaster Reduction Day as a way to teach future generations about preparedness. Other nations have created similar holidays, including Bangladesh, Chile, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Madagascar, Mexico, Mozambique and Vietnam, according to the UN.  To raise awareness in the United States, Americans should focus more on education, said Roddey, so they can  raise support for disaster preparation and ultimately  save lives. ""The United States needs to take more preventative action to prepare for disasters, said Roddey. ""If I had my hands on the purse strings I'd be spending hundreds of thousands -- if not millions of dollars -- to educate people, and to move schools and other critical facilities out of the inundation zones."" For Roddey, the right thing to do is crystal clear: Look to what the experts are predicting and act rather than react. ""We're the first generation in modern history that understands the risks and consequences of an event like what happened in Japan,"" said Roddey. ""How we prepare for it here literally defines us as a people.""

1812,"Woodward, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Paul Lord's home is a shambles, and a large bandage is draped across his head -- not from four previous brain surgeries he had endured but from the plywood that smacked him, while he was outside trying to warn a family across the street about a coming tornado. And yet Sunday, the Woodward, Oklahoma, resident was all about giving thanks. Thankful for the neighbors who, after the twister slammed through his and other homes, had rushed over and picked up the washer and driver sitting atop his grandson. Another grandson had been blown away from the house, only to be found with two big cuts on his arm. Lord also expressed appreciation for staff at Woodward Regional Hospital who, he said, had treated him and his family with a minimum of paperwork and maximum of caring and expertise. Tornado threats from Arkansas to Minnesota . And lastly, he gestured to those working feverishly behind him -- some of them neighbors, some strangers -- to clear the rubble. ""We are truly blessed. God saved us, and that's what it's about,"" Lord said. Following an earlier bout of severe weather, the tornado barreled through Woodward just after midnight Sunday. Compounding the fact it struck at such a late hour, the high winds ""took out"" the transmitter for the public siren and tornado notification system, and ""we lost our manual override"" when the electricity was knocked out, City Manager Alan Riffel said -- meaning there was no warning system. ""It caught us asleep, mostly,"" Mayor Roscoe Hill told CNN. Afterward, it was learned that five people in Woodward -- a community of about 12,000 people about 85 miles west of Enid and not far from the Panhandle -- had died as a result. While the powerful system hit a hospital, blew truckers off highways and shredded buildings in several states, Woodward was the only place where fatalities were reported over the weekend. They include Frank Hobbie, who died along with two girls -- presumed to be his 5- and 7-year-old daughters -- according to state medical examiner's spokesman Amy Elliot. Hill earlier said that a father and his two children were inside a trailer at the Hidden Valley Mobile Home Park when the tornado rolled through and killed them. Elliot identified one of the other dead as Derrin Juul. A 10-year-old girl who was found with him is thought to be Juul's daughter. Hill had said that two people died when the car they were in rolled over several times. Still, given the power and timing of the storm, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin said late Sunday afternoon that she believes it is ""remarkable that we didn't have more loss of life in Woodward."" Fallin detailed some survival stories from the small city. One man was lying asleep on his sofa, with his dog beside him, when the tornado came through, Fallin said. The intense winds picked up him and his sofa and dumped him behind his house. But except for some scrapes, he escaped unscathed. The governor also recalled how a woman described hunkering down with her family, wrapping her arms around her pregnant daughter, as the twister approached. Afterward, the daughter was rushed to a nearby hospital where her baby was delivered, safely by cesarean section, according to Fallin. Lord was a survivor long before this weekend's storms, having undergone two heart procedures in addition to his four brain surgeries. His latest wound, a big gash to his head, was stitched back up early Sunday. He said he did not initially notice it, as he rushed to get his grandson to the hospital even before he'd located his wife of 43 years. Hours later, Lord was back where his home once stood. People young and old were working hard nearby, tossing debris, cutting through wood with chainsaws and otherwise trying to bring order to the chaos caused by the tornado. ""This is Woodward, Oklahoma,"" said Lord. ""We're here to take care of each other ... We're truly blessed in so many ways, and one of them is to live here."" As to what what treasured mementos he hopes to find among the wreckage, Lord said he already had everything he needed. ""I found them. My son, my daughter, my son-in-law, my grandbabies, my wife,"" he said. ""Everything else is brick and stick, and they're all easily replaced."" CNN's Rich Phillips and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Paul Lord and his family survive after a tornado tears through his home .

1813,"Eric Moody was the pilot aboard a British Airways flight that managed, barely, to fly through volcanic ash thrown up by Mount Galunggung in Indonesia in 1982. All four of the engines stopped because of the ash, and the plane glided through the air for about 15 minutes, he said. ""The engines just ran down,"" Moody said. ""We couldn't see out the windscreen and half the electronic aids to landing weren't working, either."" Passengers were told to prepare for an emergency crash landing, with Moody making this now-famous announcement to passengers: ""Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, it's Captain Eric Moody here. We've got a small problem in that all four engines have failed. We're doing our utmost to get them going, and I trust you're not in too much distress.""

1814,"(CNN) -- The death toll from bushfires in southeastern Australia has risen to 208, the Australian Red Cross said Thursday. Forensic teams sift through the remains of a house in Pheasant Creek, north of Melbourne. Four fires are still burning across the state of Victoria, a spokeswoman with the Country Fire Authority said. All are under control, but one of the fires spawned a smaller blaze that is actively burning, said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be named, in line with policy. That fire is burning in the area of Narbethong, about an hour north of Melbourne. ""Two communities are in that area, we suspect they may be directly impacted by that particular fire,"" the spokeswoman said. ""Residents in that area are being asked to action their fire plans."" The Red Cross said it has teams in 13 locations across Victoria to help with first aid, food, and personal support. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced a national day of mourning Sunday to honor the victims of the bushfires and recognize the efforts of emergency workers. ""This day will give all Australians the chance to reflect and remember this terrible tragedy as an important step in rebuilding these communities,"" he said in a statement. The fires have destroyed more than 1,800 homes and displaced about 7,000 people. At the height of the fires, about three dozen separate blazes were burning. A suspect, 39-year-old Brendan Sokaluk, has been arrested on suspicion of setting one of the fatal fires. Sokaluk is suspected of lighting a fire on February 7. He has been charged with arson causing death, intentionally or recklessly lighting a bush fire, and possessing child pornography, Victoria state police said. The fire Sokaluk is accused of setting killed at least 21 people in Gippsland.","Authorities: Five fires still burning across the state of Victoria, all under control .

1815,"(CNN) -- The White House indicated Wednesday that a report and a photo from the controversial low-altitude New York flyover by a 747 plane used as Air Force One could be released soon. A 911 caller on the day of the flyover said, ""There's a plane falling. There is a big aircraft falling like 9/11."" Earlier, White House officials had said that there were no plans to release photos to the public. But the tone seemed to change on Wednesday. ""The report, I believe, will be concluded at some point this week. We'll release its findings and release a photo,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said during his daily press briefing. The review, led by Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina, will focus on ""why that decision was made and to ensure that it never happens again,"" Gibbs said. The flyover, officials said, was a training mission -- it was also a government-sanctioned photo shoot. Military officials also estimate that the mission and the photo shoot, aimed at updating file photos of Air Force One -- cost $328,835 in taxpayer money. But they said ""the hours would have been flown regardless, and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission."" The photo shoot, which President Obama said he was ""furious"" with, happened on April 27. The image of a low-flying plane accompanied by an F-16 fighter jet sent some New Yorkers into the streets and into a panic -- reminding them of the tragic 9/11 attacks on the city. Building evacuations also took place across the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey. Read more of Obama's reaction . White House Military Office Director Louis Caldera later apologized for the flyover. Witnesses reported seeing the plane circle over the Upper New York Bay near the Statue of Liberty before flying up the Hudson River.  Watch the plane fly over Manhattan » . A YouTube video showed people standing in a parking lot, watching the plane approach. As it nears, they begin to run. ""Run, run!"" said one person. ""Oh my God,"" cried another. A 911 call, released later by the Hudson County Sheriff's Department in New Jersey, illustrated the fear and panic felt by residents since the 9/11 attacks. ""There's a plane falling. There is a big aircraft falling like 9/11,"" a man says to the operator. ""Everybody is running and people are crying and panicking."" CNN iReporter Tom Kruk, who saw the plane and took a photo, called the sight of the aircraft low in the sky ""unsettling."" Mayor Michael Bloomberg was visibly angry last week. ""I'm annoyed -- furious is a better word -- that I wasn't told,"" he said, adding that the decision by the White House Military Office and Federal Aviation Administration to withhold details about the flight were ""ridiculous"" and ""poor judgment."" But according to Air Force Capt. Anna Carpenter, local law enforcement agencies and the FAA had been notified of the exercise. New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne confirmed that department had been alerted about the flight ""with directives to local authorities not to disclose information about it."" That decision riled local media. ""Given that we are not big on reminders of 9/11, we could have done without the whole thing. But the FAA outdunced itself by asking the NYPD to keep the photo op a secret, as if no one would look up and say, 'What the hell?' "" the New York Daily News said on April 28. The New York Post, in its editorial on the same day, said: ""The FAA had long preferred to keep passengers ignorant of these dangers. Better to have people panic, it seems, at the sudden sight of low-flying aircraft over Lower Manhattan. ... Someone needs to straighten out these folks -- quick."" The controversy had some questioning President Obama's declaration of a new era of openness, who on January 21, said: ""The old rules said that if there was a defensible argument for not disclosing something to the American people, then it should not be disclosed. That era is now over."" So why, exactly, didn't that initially apply to the photos? An advocate for government disclosure said it should, and that it's ""silly"" and ""absurd"" to withhold them.  Watch more on the photo flap » . ""These are public records because they were done on government time, with government resources, and government personnel,"" said Patrice McDermott of openthegovernment.org. In New York, news that the photos might not be released reignited public outrage over the incident. ""It doesn't seem right,"" said Kurt Wallin from New Jersey. ""If we spent the money to have these photos taken, they should be available for the public to see."" Emily Ritter from Park City, Utah, added: ""I feel like maybe they're covering it up because it's been seen in a bad light already ... maybe they are still worried about their image and don't want to be seen in a bad light.""

1816,"(CNN) -- Shortly after 10 a.m. Blair Scott sent a text to his daughter Rose, a junior at Buckhorn High School in northeast Huntsville. He could feel the lump in his throat as he warned her: You have three minutes to get to a safe place. The twister was hurtling straight toward her. It was one of two apparent tornadoes that ripped through the area Friday. Scott jumped in his car and furiously drove the three miles from his home to the school. The speedometer said 80. In his read view mirror, he could see four police cars. But they weren't chasing him. They were also charging towards to the school and the sitting targets within. Scott arrived to a surreal scene wrought by the fury of the storm. His heart skipped a few beats. He was one of thousands of Americans unnerved Friday by a swath of severe weather that extended from Alabama to Indiana. Inside the school, it was hot, damp and dark -- the power was out. The staff had gone into storm mode at about 8:45 in the morning, huddling the students in the safest place of all, the hallway, Scott said. Rose was huddled with her classmates. She could feel her frightened friend's clawing into her arm. Everyone knew the tornado coming their way, like a killer approaching a helpless victim. Everyone was terrified. Rose was 20 feet away from the door and could feel the wind forcing its way underneath. It was so strong that even through the cracks, it made her hair fly. ""We didn't know if it was going to bust open at any minute,"" she said. Signs outside were blowing; trees bending. Suddenly, it became sunny. The wind went one way one minute and another, the next. Then, it began raining. Hard. The pressure changed and got so bad it made Rose's ears hurt. She got low to the floor. A large trash bin flew through the air. Where once there had been tall oaks, there was nothing. They were horizontal with the earth and Rose could see the house that used to be hidden by vegetation across the street. When it was over, teachers screamed as they saw their wrecked cars, the building's windows shattered and part of the roof in the parking lot. Similar storms ripped through the Huntsville area about a year ago. Students, teachers and parents all had their memories. Rose had even chased tornadoes with her dad -- both father and daughter are fascinated with science and meteorology. But she had never lived through a tornado before. Now she knew what it felt like. ""It was a whole different experience,"" she said. ""I couldn't even text. My hands were shaking so bad."" Many of the students were trying to call their moms and dads but cell phone service was sketchy. She was relieved to see her father when he arrived at the school. Scott said his daughter's friends pleaded with him. ""Please, Mr. Scott,"" they said. ""Take us home."" But he couldn't. School policy forbade it so that all the students could be accounted for. ""It was heartbreaking,"" he said. ""It was horrible in there. They were so scared and apprehensive."" Scott felt incredibly lucky that everyone he loved was alright. He took his daughter home and passed the rest of the day under a tornado watch.","Blair Scott sent a text warning to his daughter at Buckhorn High School .

1817,"(CNN) -- A man walked into a Pittsburgh psychiatric hospital with a pair of guns Thursday and began firing, leading to injuries to seven people and two deaths -- including his own as police arrived and shot back, authorities said. ""This is a tragic day, a sad day, a senseless day,"" Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said after the shooting at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. City and hospital officials speaking at a Thursday evening press conference did not give the identity of the shooter, nor did they elaborate on what his motive might have been. The assailant walked through the psychiatric hospital's front door with a pair of semi-automatic handguns around 1:40 p.m., according to Ravenstahl. Officers from the University of Pittsburgh police department arrived within ""a matter of minutes"" and ""engaged"" the gunman, the mayor added. ""There is no doubt that their swift response saved lives today,"" said Ravenstahl, lauding the police officers' ""courage and willingness to step up."" Like the man who is believed to be the shooter, no details were offered on the other person killed besides the fact he, too, was an adult male. Those wounded were swiftly ushered to nearby UPMC Presbyterian. All are expected to survive. Officials said two of five hospitalized patients have undergone surgery. The conditions of the five ranged from fair to serious. Two victims were treated and released. One had an injury not related to a gunshot wound. Medical center officials said the injured included hospital employees and a visitor. ""I expect all of these patients to survive and do well,"" said Dr. Donald Yealy, chairman of emergency medicine at UPMC, said in a statement. ""As the busiest trauma centers in the region, we prepare for this kind of multi-casualty situation."" Ravenstahl said that a University of Pittsburgh police officer ""was grazed with a bullet, and I believe he is doing well."" Steven Bartholomew, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said that his agency is ""working with Pittsburgh police and other authorities in the investigation."" ""Any firearms recovered will be traced to determine their source,"" Bartholomew said. Claudia Roth, the Western Psychiatric Institute's CEO, said five of those hurt are hospital employees. No other details were offered on the victims, including whether they had been targeted, how they got hurt and who might have shot them. At one point Thursday, the University of Pittsburgh's official Twitter account had a message that suggested a ""possible 2nd actor"" was involved and called for a lockdown. But later in the day, the medical center's own Twitter feed had a message insisting ""there was no second shooter"" and that there was ""no hostage situation,"" as had been reported elsewhere. While the crisis appeared to be over by 6 p.m., Pittsburgh's mayor stressed the hospital -- particularly its first and second floors, where the gunman may have been -- ""is still an active scene."" That said, authorities said they have no indication that anyone else was involved or that there is any continuing danger. ""Our crews are methodically going through the building to make sure that every floor is cleared and every room is cleared,"" Ravenstahl said. The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine's psychiatric department is based at the institute, which describes itself on its website as a ""leader in the treatment of mental health and addictive disorders."" U.S. News and World Report ranks University of Pittsburgh Medical Center -- and thus the Western Institute -- as being the nation's eighth-best psychiatric hospital. In addition to about 2,000 employees, the hospital has 310 beds, of which about 90% had been occupied on Thursday, said Roth. She emphasized after the shooting that treatment at the facility ""will be uncompromised,"" with care continuing to be delivered through the day and night ""the same way we always have.""

1818,"(CNN) -- About 40 students at a university in New Jersey have been taken to hospitals for treatment after an outbreak of what authorities believe is the norovirus. The Rider University students, at the school's campus in Lawrenceville, were brought to hospitals late Wednesday night, the school said Thursday. The suspected outbreak comes a week after an outbreak began at nearby Princeton University, which is still under way, officials said. ""We are coordinating treatment information with that university. We have also informed neighboring institutions,"" Rider said on its website. Norovirus is a highly contagious illness that is often called stomach flu or food poisoning, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States. The most common symptoms are diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain. Most people get better within one to two days. Rider officials worked with health authorities throughout the night ""to identify ill students in the residence halls and treat them either on site or send them to area hospitals,"" the school said. Some of those taken to hospitals have been discharged and returned to campus. People who get the virus are contagious ""from the moment they begin feeling sick until at least three days after they recover,"" the school said. Infection can occur by eating contaminated food; touching contaminated surfaces and then putting contaminated fingers in your mouth; or having direct contact with an infected person. The school's food and custodial services are taking necessary steps, including cleaning all residence hall bathrooms and other areas. Rider has about 4,700 undergraduate and 1,100 graduate students, and 250 full time faculty members.","The school worked through the night to help sick students .

1819,"(CNN) -- Foreign aid to the Philippines in the wake of a deadly tropical storm has reached $12.6 million, the Philippine government announced Thursday. The United States, Australia and China were the top donors, giving cash and in-kind donations and pledges in the wake of the storm, which struck the weekend of Dec. 17. Sixteen other nations from Asia, the Middle East, and Europe also made donations or pledges, the government said. The death toll from Tropical Storm Washi, known locally as Sendong, reached 1,257 on Thursday -- largely unchanged from earlier in the week. Nearly 40,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, the government-run Philippines News Agency reported. The northern part of Mindanao, the main island in the southern Philippines, was hit the hardest. It was the scene of the worst devastation, and rain that followed the storm complicated recovery efforts. Sendong caused the Cagayan, Agus and Madulong rivers to overflow their banks, drowning many people in their sleep, the PNA reported. It sent torrents of water, mud, and logs through villages and two major cities, Cagayan de Oro and Iligan. More than 60,000 people are now taking shelter in 53 evacuation centers and another nearly 310,000 people are staying with relatives or in makeshift structures, PNA reported. Weather conditions were mostly dry by Friday morning in Mindanao.","Foreign aid has reached $12.6 million .

1820,"(CNN) -- Colombian authorities have issued a red alert, the highest level, for the Galeras volcano, because a non-explosive eruption occurred early Wednesday. Images show a slight plume of smoke and ash emanating from the volcano, which is in southwestern Colombia, near the border with Ecuador. Officials have called on about 7,000 nearby residents to evacuate to one of nine shelters in the area, but only 205 people had gone to four of the structures by Wednesday morning, the Ministry of Interior and Justice said in a news release. The volcano is not in a heavily populated region, and there were no reports of injuries or structural damage. Galeras, an ancient volcano that previously erupted in January, became active again in 1989.The only fatalities were in 1993, when nine people -- all scientists or tourists in or near the volcano's crater -- were killed. The volcano's summit stands about 14,000 feet (4,200 meters) above sea level.","Galeras volcano previously erupted in January .

1821,"Rome (CNN) -- A cruise ship of the Costa Cruises line is adrift off the coast of the Seychelles after a fire in its engine room, the Italian coast guard said Monday. The ship, the Allegra, is a sister of the Costa Concordia, which wrecked off the coast of Italy on January 13, killing at least 21 people. The fire left the Allegra without propulsion, although its communications equipment is intact, the authorities said. The Allegra's fire has been put out, and the passengers are all in good health, the authorities said. The Seychelles is sending a tug, and merchant ships in the area are steaming toward the Allegra, the coast guard said.","An engine room fire leaves the Costa Allegra without propulsion, authorities say .

1822,"Rome (CNN) -- The family of a Minnesota couple that remains unaccounted for after a massive cruise ship ran aground off an Italian island last month plans to hold a memorial service to celebrate their lives. Gerald and Barbara Heil have been missing since the Costa Concordia hit rocks and ran aground off Giglio Island on January 13. Relatives said they accept the decision to call off the search for missing passengers. A service is planned in the coming weeks, the family said in a statement. ""We are certainly disheartened to hear this news but understand and accept the decision to bring the search operation to a halt,"" the statement on the family website said. ""We cannot express enough our sincere gratitude to all those involved in the search and rescue effort."" Their daughter said her mother had not traveled much until her father retired from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. ""They'd been going a lot of places,"" Sarah Heil told Chicago's WBBM Radio. ""I was really happy because they deserved to go on this awesome trip they had planned."" The Heils are from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. A total of 15 people remain missing after the cruise ship's collision off the coast of Tuscany with about 4,200 people aboard. Seventeen bodies have been recovered. Franco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, said after the ship hit the rocks, he ran it aground to keep it from sinking and limit the tilting. It came to rest on its right side with roughly 50% of the ship under water. It is currently rotated nearly 90 degrees. Salvage operations in the part of the ship above the water line will continue, salvage officials said, along with searches around the wreck. Underwater operations have previously been temporarily suspended for safety reasons, but have always resumed. Technical experts are advising they come to a permanent end. Schettino is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still aboard. He denies the charges, saying his actions saved lives. Schettino has admitted to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge that he made a ""mistake"" in colliding with the rocks off shore. But he has brushed aside suggestions that he was going too fast, as prosecutors allege. The lead prosecutor is asking that Schettino be sent back to jail. A hearing has been scheduled for Monday. However, Schettino's lawyer says his client should be released from house arrest. A number of survivors have filed lawsuits against the company that ran the cruise, Costa Cruises. Costa has announced it is offering each of about 3,200 passengers who had been aboard the vessel a lump sum of 11,000 euros ($14,400), in compensation for their loss of property and emotional distress, as well as a refund of costs associated with the cruise. Separate agreements will be reached with those passengers who were injured and needed treatment at the scene and with the families of those who died, Costa said.

1823,"(CNN) -- Twisted metal beams still jut from the top of Japan's Fukushima Daiichi stricken reactors, almost one year after a massive tsunami triggered nuclear meltdown. They remain as an eerie monument to the country's worst ever nuclear disaster, frozen in time by the dangers that surround the reactors and what's inside. The reactors at the northern Japanese plant were declared last December to be in cold shutdown, a term used to indicate that operations are under control and pose no immediate threat. Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants, said in this instance the words ""cold shutdown"" are ""completely inappropriate"" to describe the situation at the Fukushima plant. Inside Fukushima's meltdown zone . ""There reactors are very much cold from a nuclear standpoint and from an energy standpoint, and the likelihood of it ever having another criticality or having another explosion is virtually zero,"" he said. ""But it's a consequence of the fact that they've now been shut down for a year, much more so than anything that TEPCO or that anybody else has ever done,"" he said, referring to the plant's operators Tokyo Electric Power Company. The biggest threat to the stability of the reactors, Friedlander said, is another earthquake or external event that causes a radioactive leak. ""The biggest real risk is that a pipe breaks and that hundreds of thousands of gallons of highly radioactive water ends up underground or ends up leeching back into the ocean or something like that. That's the real bottom line,"" he said. ""The chance of a massive contamination or a massive plume of radioactive contamination is almost zero,"" he added. On March 11, 2011 more than 15,000 people died after a magnitude-9.0 earthquake ruptured a 300 kilometer long fault stretching from the southern end of Japan's Ibaraki Prefecture to the middle of the Iwate Prefecture. The tremor generated a massive tsunami which smashed into the coast, swamping three prefectures including Fukushima, the site of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Three of the plant's six reactors suffered meltdowns despite frantic efforts to flood them with seawater to bring surging temperatures down. During a tour of the nuclear plant, manager Takeshi Takahashi told CNN's Kyung Lah that the biggest risk is if something goes wrong with the reactors. The nuclear fuel needs constant cooling. Huge tanks around the site hold water contaminated with radiation and finding more space to store the water is a constant challenge. ""The reactors are no more or no less stable than they were in April of last year,"" Friedlander said. ""They fundamentally continue to be reliant on a feed and bleed cooling mechanism and anything can happen. Another earthquake could happen; another tsunami could happen."" Nearly 700 aftershocks of magnitude 5 or greater have been registered since last year's quake, according to a report released in January by the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute. The report warned that there was a 70% chance that a magnitude-7 quake would hit Tokyo's metropolitan area within four years. The probability rose to 98% probability within the next 30 years, it added. Tokyo see high quake probability, scientists warn . Friedlander said that while the ticking bomb nature of the Fukushima disaster ""very appropriately"" focused attention on stabilizing the site, a year later the world should be paying more attention to the inevitable spread of radioactive material. ""I think that the reason why people don't give it attention is because they say, you know, the levels of concentration are very low, so even if you did become contaminated the risk to you is actually quite low, which is true,"" he said. ""But again, when you start exposing millions and millions and millions of people to very low levels of concentration, it's inevitable that it's going to have an impact."" Last week, fish and plankton collected from the Pacific Ocean near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were said to contain elevated levels of radioactive materials. However, the levels were below those that pose a threat to public health, according to Nicholas Fisher, a marine science professor at New York's Stony Brook University. The samples were taken in June 2011, outside the 30-kilometer (19-mile) exclusion zone around the plant, at points in and around the Kuroshio Current, the Pacific version of the Gulf Stream. Fisher said that the contaminants were more likely to have settled in coastal sediments, of which little is known. ""There's a lot of key missing information about the sediments,"" he said.","Threats remain despite cold shutdown at Fukushima plant .

1824,"(CNN) -- After a day of recovery for battered regions of the Midwest and South, a line of storms stretching from Illinois to Louisiana will bring the threat of tornadoes and severe weather Friday, forecasters said. Areas most at risk for twisters are southern Indiana, southern Ohio, most of Kentucky, central Tennessee, northeastern Mississippi and northwestern Alabama. The storms are forecast to rapidly develop around noon ET Friday. The most likely window for tornadoes will be between 4 p.m. and 8 pm. ET Friday, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. There is the potential for widespread damaging wind gusts, large hail and violent tornadoes in some areas. Storms will begin to weaken during the late evening as they move eastward toward the Appalachians. The severe weather threat will diminish overnight Friday into Saturday morning, Morris said. The tornado outbreak that began Tuesday night left 13 dead across Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Tennessee and battered parts of Kentucky as well. The latest death was reported in Kansas, where authorities said 53-year-old Richard Slade died Thursday from injuries suffered when a tornado struck Harveyville on Tuesday night. Slade had been airlifted to a nearby Topeka hospital after being pulled from the wreckage of his home. The decision was made to take him off life support, officials said. National Guard troops helped police and sheriff's deputies direct traffic and patrol streets in stricken areas of Missouri and Kentucky, while those who survived began the task of cleaning up. In Harrisburg, Illinois, where the highest death toll occurred, a tree smashed in the front window of Chris and Alice Retzloff's home before dawn Wednesday. But their neighbor's house was ""pretty much gone,"" Chris Retzloff told CNN's ""Starting Point."" ""Our damage was minimal compared to this,"" his wife added. ""We have a basement, and we went in our basement and huddled together with our dogs and the sirens went off,"" she said. ""The wind was just immense, the sound, and then the next siren went off, and there was just this incredible pressure that we all had on us."" Four women and two men died in Harrisburg, about 30 miles north of the Kentucky border. The tornado that struck it had a preliminary rating of EF4, the second most powerful on the rating scale, according to the National Weather Service. The twister appeared to have been on the ground for several miles, said Harrisburg Mayor Eric Gregg, and the path of destruction was about three or four football fields wide. Sheriff's deputes said about 100 people were injured and between 250 and 300 houses were damaged or destroyed. This Just In: Harrisburg's path of destruction . Darrell Osman lost his mother to the storm. After the twister struck, he ran to her house, only to find nothing left. ""Her house was literally gone,"" Osman said. He found his mother in an ambulance, but she passed away later at a hospital. In Washington, the White House said President Barack Obama called the governors of six states affected by the storms -- Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana -- ""to offer condolences and assistance as necessary."" One person died in each of three towns in southern Missouri where the twisters struck -- Buffalo, Puxico and Cassville -- while another three died in two east-central Tennessee counties, authorities in those states reported. A smaller tornado caused significant damage in the music resort city of Branson, Missouri. The city's entertainment district, which boasts 50 theaters, had five or six damaged; of the city's 200 hotels, 15 had significant damage, Branson Mayor Raeanne Presley said. But she told CNN, ""We'll be open for business in short order, and we will be helping those who suffered damage to rebuild."" Presley took cover with her family in the basement before immediately going out to survey the damage. Tourist town of Branson, Missouri, hit . An EF2 tornado smashed at least seven miles of the city's commercial strip, leaving 33 people hurt, most with minor to moderate injuries. The city's convention center and an attached Hilton were damaged, as was a portion of Branson Landing, a large shopping and entertainment complex. City Administrator Dean Kruithof said about five or six of the city's roughly 40 theaters were damaged. iReport: Branson Hilton windows blown out . Two tornadoes were confirmed in Tennessee's Cumberland and DeKalb counties, between Nashville and Knoxville. The one that struck Cumberland County, where two people died, was an EF2 with top winds of around 125 mph, the weather service reported Thursday evening. The remaining fatality was from an EF1 twister with top winds around 90 mph, according to forecasters. CNN's Logan Burruss, Kara Devlin, Joe Sutton and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Storms are forecast for Friday afternoon from Illinois to Louisiana .

1825,"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The death toll has risen to six following an attack on a Kenyan bus station that left dozens wounded, the Red Cross said Sunday. At least 68 people are undergoing treatment at a Nairobi hospital, according to the agency. The explosions, which authorities believe are grenade attacks, occurred Saturday at a normally-crowded bus station in central Nairobi. ""We still need to complete investigations and we cannot immediately confirm who did this, but we highly suspect that it is Al-Shabaab or sympathizers of Al-Shabaab,"" said Charles Owino, the police deputy spokesman. ""Eyewitnesses say that grenades were thrown from a vehicle and the suspected perpetrators fled from the scene."" There have been several instances of grenade attacks at bus stations and at a bar in Nairobi in recent months. One person was killed and 20 injured in October when an attacker hurled grenades into a bar and a bus station. In that attack, a Kenyan man pleaded guilty to being a member of the Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab and was charged with causing grievous bodily harm. The East African nation has been on edge since it sent its troops into Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab militants after the abductions of tourists and aid workers in Kenya. It blames the abductions on Al-Shabaab, which has denied involvement. Al-Shabaab, which the U.S. considers a terror group, has threatened to attack Kenya if it does not withdraw its forces from Somalia.","NEW: At least 68 others are injured .

1826,"(CNN) -- Authorities treated more than 700 people for food poisoning after a political rally in southern Mexico this week, officials said. Exactly what caused the food poisoning was unclear, officials from the healthy ministry in Mexico's Guerrero state said Wednesday. Authorities were testing food and drink samples from the event and sending representatives to communities throughout the area to look for additional cases. Alberta Garcia Adame told CNN affiliate Televisa she started to feel sick after eating egg tacos at a rally Tuesday in Chilapa, Guerrero, for Sergio Dolores Flores, who is running for congress as a candidate for Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party. As the number of cases grew, doctors treated many patients at a local hospital and a temporary shelter at the back of a local church, Televisa reported. Guerrero State Health Secretary Rufino Dominguez said in a statement Wednesday that nearly all of the patients had been treated and released.","Authorities are testing food and drink samples from the event .

1827,"(CNN) -- Oppressed by war and poverty for generations, the Sudanese have struggled with terrible hardships. But the people of this vast country have a narrow window of hope to achieve progress by ridding both their nation and the world of a horrible disease forever. With support from The Carter Center and others in one small targeted area where cases remain, Sudan -- the last stand for Guinea worm disease -- could quickly eliminate this parasitic infection contracted from contaminated drinking water. Guinea worm victims endure the horror of a thin worm, up to 3 feet (1 meter) long, emerging slowly through a burning blister in their skin over the course of about a month after the parasite has incubated inside them for a year. This can be stopped by educating people to filter all drinking water and to stay out of water sources when they have a worm emerging to keep it from discharging new larvae back into the water. Click to see Guinea worm disease: Then and now . Because the worm requires a human host, it is within our control to eradicate it. Poised to become only the second disease eradicated from Earth besides smallpox -- which had different challenges -- Guinea worm cases have been reduced from about 3.5 million in 20 nations in 1986 to about 3,200 in 2009. Eighty-six percent of remaining cases in the world are in Southern Sudan, where violence continues to threaten the population and health workers. The few other cases are in Ghana, Mali and Ethiopia. I recently returned to Southern Sudan to visit an endemic Guinea worm village and met with ministers of health from Northern and Southern Sudan, who are assisted in their Guinea worm eradication effort primarily by The Carter Center and other partners, including the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sudan has reduced its cases by 98 percent since the eradication program began there in 1995, and we expect even greater reductions in 2010. But continuing insecurity is a major concern. In 2009, Guinea worm workers were forced at least 32 times to remain in their homes or offices or had to be evacuated temporarily because of violence or threatened violence, and areas affected by violence reported at least half of all cases last year. The greatest periods of progress have been when violence abated -- during a cease-fire lasting almost six months that I negotiated between Northern and Southern Sudan in 1995 to initiate the Guinea worm program there, and since the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Also challenging is the slow pace of providing safe drinking water in endemic villages, only 16 percent of which have even one safe water source. The campaign has hinged on providing cloth filters, health education, and a mild insecticide to kill the parasite in water. This has been effective in bringing us to the brink of eradication, albeit slowly. But wherever possible, creating new sources of clean groundwater can accelerate elimination, with the added benefit of preventing many other water-based maladies. This is just one example of how investing in disease prevention and eradication can strengthen the foundation for progress in developing nations. Across Africa, Guinea worm eradication workers have blazed new trails to prevent the disease in remote villages. Likewise, networks of thousands of volunteer health care workers have been created to identify cases, deliver cloth water filters, and ensure that their infected neighbors do not step into a water source. They form the backbone of a rudimentary health care delivery system that is both low cost and effective in fighting other diseases, too. A war waged to vanquish the fiery serpent . No one is working harder to eradicate Guinea worm disease than the Sudanese themselves. Sudan has a corps of more than 13,500 passionate and dedicated volunteer health workers -- foot soldiers of Guinea worm eradication under the very capable direction of the Southern Sudan Ministry of Health and supported by 41 Sudanese and expatriate technical assistants from The Carter Center. Whatever the outcome of April's national elections in Sudan and the referendum on national unity in Southern Sudan next January, ridding their nation of Guinea worm disease will show the world what Southern Sudanese can do when they are not distracted by war. This will be an important victory for Sudan and the world. With a little more help from their global neighbors, this achievement could be within reach very soon.","Jimmy Carter: Sudanese have chance to rid nation and world of a horrible disease .

1828,"(CNN) -- A powerful tornado ripped through West Liberty, Kentucky, last week, making the quaint community look like ""a war zone,"" according to the state's governor. Fortunately, the First Response Team of America was there to help. Founded by 2008 CNN Hero Tad Agoglia, the organization brought its specialized fleet of disaster recovery equipment to West Liberty. Since 2007, the First Response Team has crisscrossed the country, providing free aid to as many as 40 disaster sites. Agoglia recently spoke to CNN's Rob Marciano about the team's efforts in West Liberty. Rob Marciano: It seems like you got here right as the storm hit. Were you one of the first guys on the ground? Tad Agoglia: We arrived just a few hours after the storm went through this mountain community. It was very interesting trying to figure out a way in, because we have huge tractor-trailers. A lot of these mountainous roads are very windy, and there were trees down, power lines down. But we eventually found the epicenter of the city right where the tornado went through. Marciano: You've seen a lot of disasters like this. What was your first reaction? Agoglia: The tornado that went through West Liberty was pretty unique. Not only did it go directly through the heart of town and destroy all of the infrastructure that's needed for a community to get back on their feet, but it also went through the hills where a lot of folks were in their homes. (That) makes it very difficult for firefighters and emergency workers to get through those windy hills and access those home sites to do search and rescue. Marciano: What's the reaction to your team when you get into town? Agoglia: When we arrive on the scene sometimes, it is hard for these community leaders to really believe that we are here for free with all of this gear. But they quickly do realize that we are there to help and that we care. And when they see the equipment working and the light towers go up and the roads start being cleared, they begin to realize that we are good people and that we are coming with no strings attached to help them. ... They need tools and resources that they don't have themselves. And when they see us coming in with all the equipment ... they welcome us into the community because they know they need the help. Marciano: What are some key things your team does to help communities like West Liberty? Agoglia: After a tornado of this magnitude strikes a small community like this, the priorities have to be identified. The roads need to be cleared so that emergency workers like firefighters and search-and-rescue teams can come in and find the people and extract them to safety. They need lighting so they can see. It is very easy to walk into power lines or step on nails ... so light towers are important. So, we've cleared the roads, we've provided the light towers. This town has a small grocery store and gas station. ... It needed power so that people could get food and water and baby food and the essentials, including gasoline so that the emergency workers can have fuel for their trucks and carry on. Marciano: At what point do you decide: ""OK, our work is done here. It is time to move on?"" Agoglia: The First Response Team provides a unique service. It's that in-between phase, that gap when the storm first strikes and when traditional help arrives. Our priority is that first day, that first night and that first few weeks until traditional help arrives. Marciano: Why do you do this? Why did you choose this road? Agoglia: There is just something inside of me that feels compelled to help. When I am watching the news and I see those super cells go right over these small communities and heart of America, I know that people are going through some of the most traumatic times they have ever experienced in their lives, and I want to be there to help.","CNN Hero Tad Agoglia and his First Response Team provide free help after natural disasters .

1829,"(CNN) -- Two pilots in northern California were lucky to be alive Monday after they escaped a midair collision without serious injuries. A helicopter clipped a small plane in the skies over northern California on Sunday evening, sending both crashing to the ground, CNN affiliate KCRA reported, citing the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office. The collision snapped off the helicopter's tail, but firefighters found the pilot sitting in the car of a driver who had stopped to help, the station said. ""She was a little shaken up, but she was completely with it,"" said Capt. Brandon Wilson of the Rio Vista Fire Department. ""Initially, she didn't want to go to the hospital. ""The person that was flying it was very lucky -- very lucky -- to walk away pretty much uninjured."" The helicopter, a Robinson R22, went down about eight miles south of the Rio Vista Airport, between San Francisco and Sacramento. It collided with a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza, which landed near Byron Airport, some 20 miles to the south, said Ian Gregor of the Federal Aviation Administration. Footage of the helicopter showed it resting in a field. KCRA said its severed tail rotor landed about 50 feet away from the fuselage. The plane's pilot was not injured. ""Absolutely a best-case scenario, very lucky for everybody involved,"" Wilson said.

1830,"(CNN) -- Authorities were using military helicopters and a C-130 cargo plane Sunday to evacuate thousands of residents stranded by rising floodwaters in the eastern Australian state of Queensland, the government said. Heavy rains in recent weeks have swollen rivers beyond their banks, threatening a number of communities in Queensland and New South Wales. Authorities were using the plane and helicopters to evacuate patients from a hospital in particularly hard-hit Queensland town of St. George, where officials were warning about 4,000 residents to get out of the path of what officials say will be a record-breaking flood. ""This is a very serious situation and I urge people to cooperate,'' Queensland Premier Anna Bligh told CNN affiliate Nine Network. The Balonne River is expected to crest Monday at 15 meters (49.2 feet), swamping the town of St. George. Prime Minister Julia Gillard said authorities were coordinating calls for assistance. """"Emergency Management Australia has liaison officers in flood-affected regions to ensure that requests for any further assistance can be actioned immediately,"" Gillard said in a statement. Food and medical supplies have been flown to isolated communities elsewhere in Queensland, authorities said. Rescue workers on Sunday recovered the body of a woman who died trying to drive her pickup through floodwaters, authorities said. Jane Sheahan was swept away Friday in the Queensland town of Roma, authorities said. Witnesses told CNN affiliate Nine Network that Sheahan managed to hand off her 7-year-old son, Darcy, to a would-be rescuer before she was swept away. In the neighboring province of New South Wales, thousands of people remained isolated despite reports of receding floodwaters in some areas. Emergency officials lifted a number of evacuations ordered evacuations early Sunday, though they warned residents not to walk, drive or swim in the receding waters. Flood waters have started to recede around North Moree after five days of major flooding, the New South Wales Emergency Services said, but many of the town's streets remain closed. Aerial assessments show some 300 homes and businesses have been inundated -- making it the worst flooding in nearly 60 years, CNN affiliate Seven Network reported.

1831,"Tokyo (CNN) -- One year after a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck northeast Japan, killing nearly 16,000 people and sparking the world's worst nuclear crisis in 25 years, the country will pause Sunday to remember the exact moment the earth shook. At exactly 2:46 p.m. local time (12:46 a.m. ET), a moment of silence will be held to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the 9.0-magnitude quake -- a tremor so great, it literally shifted the earth's axis. Observances will be held across the country, with a main ceremony at the New National Theatre in Tokyo. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda is expected to attend that event and offer remarks. He spoke to CNN recently about the country's rebuilding efforts, which represent Japan's greatest challenge since the end of World War II. Total damage has been estimated at about 25 million yen, or roughly $300 billion so far. ""The Japanese people are united in working with the government to put all our might towards working on the reconstruction,"" Noda said this month. Read iReporters' reflections on the anniversary . ""The debris cleanup, the building of temporary houses and daily support for the disaster victims -- we have been making steady progress on all those issues,"" he said. Besides wrecking havoc itself, the earthquake triggered one of the worst tsunamis in recent years, unleashing a wall of water that swept away lives, homes and sent millions of people fleeing for higher ground. Read Banana Yoshimoto's piece on living after the disaster . Japan also found itself dealing with the worst nuclear crisis since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the quake's wake. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility was knocked offline, resulting in a meltdown of three reactors, with radiation leaking into the air and contaminated water spilling into the sea. While no deaths were attributed to the nuclear disaster, more than 100,000 people remain displaced from the towns where its long-lived fallout settled. Read what the Fukushima accident did to the ocean . One year on, Japan is far from dug out of the destruction wrought by the triple disaster, which killed nearly 16,000 people. More than 3,000 others are still missing. But the country, the prime minister said, is committed to rebuilding and emerging as a strengthened nation. Read about the 'low-tech' disaster cleanup . ""I would like to accelerate the reconstruction and by doing so energize Japan as well,"" Noda said.

1832,"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- The death toll from a tropical storm that pummeled the Philippines rose to at least 447 on Sunday, according to the national chairman of the Philippine Red Cross. The vast majority of the bodies were found in the cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro, according to military officials and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Five people were killed in a landslide, but all others died in flash flooding. The provinces of Compostela Valley and Zamboanga del Norte were also hit, added Benito Ramos, chairman of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. About 400 people remain missing after Tropical Storm Washi, which is called Sendong locally. More than 2,000 have been rescued, the country's military reported. Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said officials are investigating reports that an entire village was swept away. Philippine Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon will travel to the stricken region Monday to assess the damage, according to a statement from the organization. Authorities have also begun distributing food rations for some 10,000 families affected by the storm, while also handing out thousands of blankets and mosquito nets, the Red Cross reported Saturday. Flash flooding overnight Friday -- following 10 hours of rain -- fueled the devastation, compounded by overflowing rivers and tributaries. As much as 20 centimeters (8 inches) of rain fell within 24 hours in some areas. Ramos said despite government warning, some did not evacuate. An estimated 100,000 people are displaced, according to the Department of Social Welfare and Development. At least 20,000 people were staying in 10 evacuation centers in Cagayan de Oro, Social Welfare Secretary Dinky Soliman said Saturday. Some 20,000 soldiers embarked on search-and-rescue operations, the military said. Officials asked for volunteers to pack food to send to those displaced. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed her condolences on behalf of the U.S. government and said the United States ""stands ready to assist Philippine authorities as they respond to this tragedy.""

1833,"(CNN) -- Canadian skier Nik Zoricic died of head injuries sustained from a crash while racing Saturday at a World Cup Ski Cross event in Grindelwald, Switzerland. The 29-year-old Toronto resident died as a result of ""severe neurotrauma,"" despite being hospitalized shortly after the crash, according to a statement from the International Ski Federation. Zoricic fell just before the finish in the competition's eighth round, slamming into the course's safety netting, the statement said. Video footage showed him going wide to the right in the final jump. ""Nik was a very talented young ski racer and a great athlete who was much loved by his teammates and fellow competitors,"" Alpine Canada president Max Gartner said. ""He will be greatly missed by all of us and the ski community as a whole."" Zoricic, who was born in Sarajevo, began as an alpine racer but later switched to ski cross, a type of timed racing that includes skiing over a variety of terrain which is thought to test both a skier's freestyle and alpine skills. He was sixth in the overall standings in 2011, according to the federation. U.S. racer Ted Ligety tweeted Saturday that ""skiing is a great sport that gives but it also takes."" ""Sad day to lose Nik Zoricic, you'll be missed bud,"" he wrote. Zoricic's grandmother, Sofia Drudar, told CNN's Canadian affiliate CBC, ""It is such a tragedy. The hardest part ... I'm old already and still here and he is so young (and) gone."" The incident prompted race organizers to cancel the entire event, including the World Cup Final scheduled for Sunday. Zoricic's death on Saturday comes in the wake of the death of another 29-year-old Canadian skier, who died following a brutal crash during a training run in Park City, Utah. Sarah Burke, an X Games freestyler and Olympic hopeful, died after a fall on January 10. Dave Campbell, coach of Zoricic's home ski club in Collingwood, Ontario, said the community was in shock. ""All over the world he (was) a very competitive young man, a very talented athlete. He was kind of a role model here at the club for all the young racers."" Zoricic went to the ski cross team in 2008. His first World Cup podium finish was in January 2011.","NEW: Skier was a role model for younger athletes, his coach says .

The 35-year-old club captain was taken off the pitch at Fir Park on a stretcher in the closing stages of the Scottish Premier League match, which his side won 5-3. Motherwell's next two  matches, against Hibernian on Wednesday, and Celtic at the weekend, have been postponed. ""The players, the supporters, every one inside the executive are devastated and absolutely dumbfounded by the event of Phil's death,"" manager Mark McGhee said on Sunday. ""We had a meeting this morning with the players and obviously they have taken it very, very badly and we are going to have to help them through that."" O'Donnell, who started his career at Motherwell before stints with Celtic and Sheffield Wednesday, was about to be substituted at Fir Park against Dundee United but collapsed before he could leave the field. He was set to be replaced by substitute Marc Fitzpatrick, but fell to the pitch as the change was taking place. After been treated for about five minutes on the field, O'Donnell was carried off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance. Medical staff from both clubs said that they thought he suffered a seizure, and efforts were made to revive him en route to hospital. However, he did not regain consciousness and was pronounced dead at 1718 GMT (1218 EST). O'Donnell's nephew, David Clarkson, who scored twice in the match, was also taken off after being alarmed by the incident. Club chairman Bill Dickie said: ""Unfortunately I can confirm very, very sad news that Phil O'Donnell has lost his life. We don't know what it was but there will be a post-mortem. ""This is a tragic happening and that's all I can say."" Motherwell owner John Boyle said: ""Everyone here is shocked to the core, and we are sure that everyone involved in Scottish football will feel the same. ""Phil was not only an inspirational player for Motherwell and club captain, but was an inspirational person. All of us at Motherwell are thinking of his wife Eileen and their four children."" McGhee added: ""I don't want to say anything more than how devastated everyone at the club is for his wife and his young children. Obviously from the club's point of view, we'll gather round to give his family as much support as they need."" O'Donnell, who won one Scotland international cap, began his career with Motherwell and rejoined the club in 2004 following spells with Celtic -- who he joined in a $3.5 million transfer in 1994 -- and English side Sheffield Wednesday. Scottish Football Association chief executive Gordon Smith said: ""This is absolutely devastating news. Phil was not just a wonderful footballer, he was a great human being. My thoughts are with his family at this tragic time."" Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell added: ""When the news came through, everyone at the club was obviously shocked. ""Our thoughts are with his family to whom we offer extreme condolences for a tragic loss of a young life. Everyone at Celtic Park will mourn him."" O'Donnell is the second Motherwell player to pass away unexpectedly in the past 20 years. Club legend winger Davie Cooper died at the age of 39 in 1995 after suffering a brain haemorrhage when filming a training video. Cooper had been a Motherwell team-mate of O'Donnell, who made his debut as a 17-year-old. He went on to score, as a 19-year-old, in the 4-3 victory over Dundee United in the 1991 Scottish Cup final, and won his sole Scotland cap in 1993 as a substitute in the World Cup qualifier against Switzerland. Former Scotland manager Craig Brown gave O'Donnell his only international outing, and had coached him in the Under-21 side. ""But for injury, I'm sure he would have had many, many more caps,"" Brown said. ""It's very, very sad news, I just can't get over it. You would not get a more ideal role model for a young footballer than Phil O'Donnell. ""I think in his first spell at Motherwell he was probably the best box-to-box midfield player -- maybe not just in Scotland but in the UK."" Injuries affected O'Donnell's spells with Celtic and Sheffield Wednesday and he returned to Motherwell after being released by Wednesday in early 2004. He played in the 2005 Scottish League Cup final, and was appointed captain in 2006 after former skipper Scott Leitch left the club. Football has suffered several other deaths in recent years. Cameroon midfielder Marc-Vivien Foe collapsed and died at the 2003 Confederations Cup in France, prompting world ruling body FIFA to demand stricter physical testing on players. Sevilla midfielder Antonio Puerta died in August after he collapsed on the field during a Spanish league game due to heart problems. Striker Chaswe Nsofwa died of heart failure while training in Israel, and 16-year-old English player Anton Reid died after collapsing while training with his club Walsall.

1835,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Learjet departing Chicago's Midway airport last month came within about two plane-lengths of striking a taxiing Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 that had been cleared to cross the same runway, according to a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board. The airborne Learjet passed 62 feet above -- and within 287 feet laterally -- of the Southwest passenger plane, according to the NTSB, which is investigating the incident. According to the NTSB, the co-pilot of the taxiing Southwest jet saw the Learjet and shouted ""Stop"" to the plane's captain, who brought the plane to a halt near the edge of the runway. Air traffic control audio tapes, released by LiveATC.net, a website for aviation enthusiasts, captured conversations between the Southwest crew and controllers in the minutes immediately afterward. ""OK... You just cleared us onto a runway (where) there was a plane taking off,"" one of the pilots said to controllers. ""What technology clears us on the runway when a plane was taking off?"" a pilot added, sounding exasperated. The Southwest crew then radioed another controller. ""We had to hit our brakes and the thing went right over our head,"" the crew said. According to the NTSB's preliminary report, the incident occurred about 9 a.m. CT on December 1, when a Learjet 45 was instructed to line up and wait on runway 31 right. Southwest Flight 844 had landed on a parallel runway -- 31 center. As the Southwest plane was decelerating on the center runway, the Learjet was cleared for takeoff on the right. When an air traffic controller gave the Southwest plane clearance to turn right on a taxiway that crossed the right runway, the two planes came into potential conflict. Kevin Hiatt, a former 737 pilot now with the non-profit Flight Safety Foundation, said it is still unclear what caused the mishap, but credited the Southwest co-pilot for averting potential disaster. ""Fortunately, the first officer was 'heads up' in that cockpit and basically saw the Learjet coming, and told the captain to stop, which he did just prior to entering into the active runway,"" Hiatt said. ""If that Learjet had had any kind of a problem and not lifted off when it did -- they prevented a very serious accident,"" Hiatt said. Hiatt said Midway airport is one of 35 airports equipped with an surface movement detection system known as ASDE-X to detect potential runway conflicts. ""The investigation will probably look into whether ASDE-X was in operation at the time or (whether) the controllers using it or not using it,"" he said. The NTSB said the report is preliminary, and no blame has been assigned in the matter. No one was injured in the event. CNN's Mary Snow contributed to this report.","The Southwest crew tells the tower, ""The thing went right over our head""

1836,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A plane carrying dozens of British vacationers skidded on landing in Spain's Canary Islands on Friday morning, briefly causing the closure of the runway but causing no injuries, the country's airport authority said. The Air Europa Boeing-737 sits parked at the end of the runway at the airport in Lanzarote. The Thomas Cook-chartered Air Europa flight was arriving at the airport on the island of Lanzarote at 7:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) when it skidded off the runway, spokespeople for the airport authority told CNN. However two Air Europa spokespeople disagreed and said the plane came to rest at the end of the runway's asphalt. The flight from Glasgow, Scotland was carrying 74 passengers and six crew members. A spokesman for travel agent Thomas Cook told the British Press Association: ""We can confirm that an Air Europa flight (AEA196), which was charted by Thomas Cook, was involved in a runway incident at Lanzarote's Arrecife Airport this morning. ""Thomas Cook staff were on hand at the airport to assist all passengers and can confirm that all guests are now en route to their holiday hotels. ""Thomas Cook has called on Air Europa and the airport authorities to provide a full explanation."" Air Europa said it was investigating what caused the plane to skid. The plane was not damaged, the company added. The incident caused the airport runway to be closed for three hours, during which time the plane was removed from the runway, the airport spokesman said. The runway reopened at 10:25 a.m. (6:25 a.m. ET), he said. Air Europa was founded in 1986 and is based in Palma, on the Spanish island of Majorca. Its fleet comprises of 32 modern Boeing aircraft and an Airbus A340, PA said.","UK plane with 80 crew and passengers skids on landing in Lanzarote Friday .

1837,"(CNN) -- Scores of would-be swashbucklers found themselves in need of rescuing Saturday night when their ship -- the Pirate's Ransom -- ran aground in west Florida, a government spokeswoman said. The pirate-themed ship was actually one of two vessels in and around Clearwater whose passengers inadvertently celebrated New Year's Eve on shore, rather that at sea. The other ship -- the Island Time -- went aground while trying to take some of the first ship's passengers ashore, said city public safety spokeswoman Elizabeth Watts. Eventually, fire and police boats ended up ferrying the 100 passengers on the Pirate's Ransom safely back to shore, as intended. One 77-year-old female passenger was ""checked out at the scene, but refused treatment,"" said Watts. The Pirate's Random is the vessel of one ""Captain Memo,"" whose website invites ""briny buccaneers and seafaring seadogs"" to join his crew in feasting, drinking and searching for dolphins. Memo's mates include wenches, like ""Take Your Treasure Terri,"" and captains like ""Gangplank Gary"" and ""Scurvy Steve."" Watts said that ""fog is believed to be a factor in the ships running aground.""","Two ships run aground in west Florida, one of them a pirate-themed vessel .

1838,"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Italian search-and-rescue teams have found another body aboard the partly sunken cruise ship Costa Concordia, civil protection office spokeswoman Francesca Maffini said Sunday. The woman is the 13th confirmed victim of the wreck on January 13. Divers are working to recover the body, which was found underwater on bridge number 7, Maffini said. The victim was wearing a life jacket, she said. The discovery leaves about 19 people still missing since the ship hit rocks in the shallow waters off the coast of Tuscany, according to CNN count. A 12th body was found within the ship Saturday afternoon, according to Italian authorities. The body of a woman wearing a life jacket was discovered in an area of the ship that was under water, Maffini said. A committee comprising the parties involved in the rescue told a briefing for reporters and residents on the island that search and rescue efforts will continue -- but that the environmental risk is also becoming urgent. Officials said they cannot predict how long it will take to clear the wreckage, since that depends on maritime conditions and technical difficulties, but all legal, environmental and human factors will be taken into account. ""It's time for Italy to show it can do something right and do it well,"" said Franco Gabrielli. Gabrielli, who leads Italy's civil protection agency, warned that the task ahead was complicated and daunting, not least because it takes about 45 minutes to search each cabin, using special cameras and divers. The giant Costa Concordia had 1,500 cabins on board. Gabrielli said no fuel oil had yet leaked from the ship -- only kitchen and engine oil -- and that he did not see an immediate risk of the 2,400 tons on board escaping. A plan to remove the fuel oil has been approved, he said, and will begin once experts give the go-ahead. Booms have been put in place around the ship to stop the spread of oil and other pollutants such as detergents and sewage chemicals. With 4,000 people aboard, the ship was the size of a small town, Gabrielli said. Fuel will be replaced with water as it is removed from the ship's tanks to keep the ship balanced, said Adm. Ilarione Dell'Anna, head of coastal authorities for the port city of Livorno. Gabrielli said Costa Cruises, the company that owns the cruise ship is cooperative and was proving responsible, despite past errors. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. An audio recording obtained by Italy's Repubblica newspaper and published Saturday shows that the captain, at least at the outset of the incident, assured authorities he would do the right thing. According to the recording, an Italian Coast Guard official asks Schettino how many people needed to be evacuated to the top of the ship to be rescued on life boats. ""About two of three hundred people still,"" the captain says. The Coast Guard asks -- will everyone evacuate, or will someone stay behind? ""I will stay here,"" Schettino answers, saying that he believed that the boat was done leaning over. Other audio recordings previously released, however, indicate that Schettino did not stay on board, but left the ship, to the anger of authorities. The office of prosecutor Francesco Verusio said it would lodge an appeal against the investigating judge's decision to grant the captain house arrest. Verusio has said he that the captain should be in jail given the flight risk, and the gravity of his crimes. Schettino's lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, spoke to Italian news channel Sky Tg24 on Friday, urging people to reserve judgment on the captain until they have all the facts. Schettino's leadership has been repeatedly questioned. Earlier this week, a cook from the ship told a Filipino television station that the captain ordered dinner for himself and a woman at about 10:30 p.m. -- less than an hour after the collision. However, a Moldovan woman, Domnica Cemortan, 25, who also works for the cruise line but said she was on the Concordia as a passenger, defended the captain in a TV interview. ""I've heard in Russian media that the captain left the ship first, or among the first. But this is not true,"" she said. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members. The vast majority fled the ship safely.

1839,"Port Victoria, Seychelles (CNN) -- The cruise ship Costa Allegra, disabled two days ago by an engine room fire, is due to arrive in the Seychelles Thursday, Costa Cruises said Wednesday. Passengers and crew will be put on planes and sent home almost immediately, the Indian Ocean nation's tourism chief said. Costa Cruises said it had secured 600 plane tickets and 400 hotel rooms. There are more than 1,000 people on the Allegra. With power out, they are using mineral water for washing, Costa said. They have a supply of cold food including fruit, cheese and cold cuts, and fresh bread is being flown to the ship by helicopter, the company said. A large French fishing ship began towing the liner to port on Tuesday. A Seychelles Coast Guard ship reached the Costa Allegra later in the day, along with two tugboats from the Seychelles Ports Authority, said Seychelles presidential spokeswoman Srdjana Janosevic. The ship was being escorted to Port Victoria, the Seychelles capital, she said. The Allegra lost power in the Indian Ocean Monday with 636 passengers on board and a crew of 413, according to Costa Cruises. Most of the passengers are from Europe, but eight are from the United States and 13 are from Canada. Costa initially said Tuesday the ship was expected to arrive Wednesday at the Seychelles island of Desroches, but said later that after ""extensive and accurate checks,"" passengers could not get off on Desroches. The ship is instead being towed to the Seychelles island of Mahe, where Port Victoria is located, the cruise line said. ""The disembarkation in Desroches does not assure the necessary and adequate security conditions for mooring the ship and guests' disembarkation,"" the cruise line said in a statement. ""In addition, logistics and hotels on the island are not enough; it would require an immediate transfer from Desroches to Mahe through ferries."" The ship departed from Diego Suarez, Madagascar, on Saturday and was originally scheduled to arrive in the Seychelles Tuesday. The Allegra is a fleet mate of the Costa Concordia, which wrecked off the coast of Italy on January 13, killing at least 21 people.

1840,"Grosseto, Italy (CNN) -- The captain of the Italian cruise liner Costa Concordia ""committed a tragic error,"" but his crew did their best to evacuate the ship's 3,200 passengers, the last survivor found aboard said Wednesday. Manrico Giampedroni, one of the ship's officers, said he was on the darkened bridge with Capt. Francesco Schettino when the Concordia hit the rocks off the Mediterranean island of Giglio the night of January 13. He broke a leg as the liner rolled and was found 36 hours later in a half-flooded dining room, suffering from hypothermia. ""All of the members of the crew did their best. They made a good job, everybody,"" he told CNN before his release from the hospital. But, he said, Schettino ""committed a tragic error. Maybe he was too confident in his skills, and he relied too much on his knowledge of the ship."" At least 17 people died when the Concordia ran aground and settled sideways on the sea bottom off Giglio, with half of the vessel still sticking out of the shallow water. Another 15 remained unaccounted for more than two weeks after the accident. Giampedroni was the ship's purser, the officer in charge of passenger accommodations and food service. He also oversaw the evacuation that followed Concordia's grounding. Schettino had invited him to the bridge to watch as he steered the ship past Giglio in what the captain called ""a salute"" to the island town, Giampedroni told reporters on his way out of the hospital. About a half-dozen people were on the bridge, which was darkened for night operations. He said he thought the ship was passing too close to the island, ""but the captain drives the ship. He knows very well where he should pass."" ""In this occasion, we cannot say, 'Captain, we are too near the coast.' We cannot say that. In this case, it is best only to watch and nothing else."" Schettino has said that after the impact, he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking and limit its list. The captain is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still aboard. He denies the charges, saying his actions saved lives and dismissing prosecutors' suggestions that he was going too fast. Critics have also questioned whether Schettino waited too long to give the order to abandon ship. Giampedroni said that decision was up to the captain -- but once given, ""Everyone worked in the proper way."" ""Consider that the ship was leaning very fast, it was a little difficult for us to put the people in safe, on the life boats,"" he said. Most of the 3,000-plus passengers and the ship's crew of about 1,000 made it safely off the ship in less than two hours, he said. Giampedroni told CNN that he was hurt when he was heading back to the muster stations where passengers assembled to leave the ship. ""Muster station A was completely evacuated,"" he said. ""I wanted to check if there was anyone left on muster station B. When I was going there, in the restaurant, I had the accident. The ship was tilted, and it was easy to lose orientation."" Giampedroni was half-submerged in the chilly water flooding the restaurant when found. He said he survived by sipping at a soft drink that he caught as it floated by, since the contents had not been contaminated with salt water.","Manrico Giampedroni was on Concordia's bridge when the ship ran aground .

1841,"Paris (CNN) -- Two French soldiers died and a third was critically injured after being shot by a black-clad man wearing a motorcycle helmet in the southwestern French city of Montauban, the French Defense Ministry said Thursday. The defense ministry corrected its earlier report that all three soldiers had died. ""The last one is not dead, but he is in a very bad state,"" said ministry spokeswoman Natalie Neveu. The third soldier was hospitalized in Toulouse, she said. Two of the soldiers, aged 24 and 26, died at the scene of the shooting, officials said earlier. The three soldiers were at a commercial center when the man approached them, pulled a gun and started firing, city police commander Charles Cauquil told CNN. The police and army were seeking the shooter, who fled the scene after the attack. The three soldiers belonged to the 17th parachute regiment stationed in Montauban, a Defense Ministry spokesman said. The judiciary police in Toulouse were investigating the shooting, Cauquil said. Montauban, capital of the Tarn-et-Garonne area, is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Toulouse.

1842,"(CNN) -- As Tropical Storm Washi washed over the southern Philippine island of Mindanao last December, heavy rains triggered deadly floods and landslides. More than 1,000 people died and at least 1,500 were injured, according to the Red Cross. The storm, locally called Typhoon Sendong, left tens of thousands homeless. 'Calamity' after Philippines storm . When iReporter Vince Avena from Quezon City, a Manila suburb, saw the destruction spread across the southern part of his country, he knew he had to act. He and a group of seven friends planned a trip to Mindanao for the first week of February so they could help in the effort to rebuild. They named it ""Operation VALENTINES."" iReport: Operation VALENTINES under way . Shortly after the group arrived in Cagayan de Oro, Avena shared his thoughts and hopes for the trip with CNN by e-mail in this Impact Q&A. CNN: Tell me about your trip. How did it start? Avena: A handful of iReporter friends of mine, along with myself, wanted to do something for the victims of Typhoon Sendong other than just writing or talking about it. We felt the need to at least do something to show the people that there are those who do care about their situation. We started to plan a quick trip to [Cagayan de Oro] a day before the new year. But it was not enough. We needed to do something more. Thus, a second trip was planned, this time over a month after the typhoon. That is because we figured that by that time (this February), the attention of the general public would have shifted elsewhere. The victims would have been just statistical data and forgotten. What better thing to do on the love month of February, than to do something that will show these people the love and concern we do have for them. To give them the ""Christmas"" they didn't get. To bring to them some joy and happiness. CNN: What are you doing? Avena: We each tried to gather things, relief goods from friends and relatives, even our own personal belongings that we felt would be useful. We coordinated with people in the area -- Cagayan de Oro and Iligan -- who would accompany us in our relief efforts. Personally, I gathered the elementary school books of my kids from grade one to six for all subjects which the people in Iligan can use to start a small library. I do have almost half a ton of clothes ready just in case the people would need clothes. We hope to go back to the area and see what else we can do for the people we've met if possible, to help them rebuild a schoolroom at least, and help them with their water supply as they have only one source of water for the entire barangay (or district). CNN: Why is this project important? Avena: For all the hazards and disasters that occur, be it natural or man-made, the children are the ones that suffer the most. They are the most vulnerable. Though not related to us in any way, even as total strangers, our hearts lead us to do something, anything, that can help lighten the load of these people. We may not be able to help everyone, but those that we can help by whatever means possible, then it is something worth doing. CNN: How are you making an impact? Avena: By creating awareness. By getting others involved. By giving a way by which people, ordinary people, can help others through our joint efforts. By planning what we want to accomplish, and following through on our promise. By starting to help -- one life, one community, one step at a time. CNN: Why should other people get involved? Avena: Life has got to be more than just working and having a good time. We have to stand for something. There is a time when we should just stop criticizing, stop staying on the sideline, stop being a spectator. It is about time that people get involved in what's happening around them. Rather than being a part of the problem, let us be key to the solution. What are you doing to Impact Your World? We want to hear about how you or someone you know is making a difference in the lives of others.

1843,"(CNN) -- Federal officials say a plane crash that killed 265 people was caused in part by a rudder system design featured in various Airbus models. American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in a residential area of Belle Harbor, New York, soon after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport on November 12, 2001. All 260 people onboard died, along with five people on the ground. According to a recommendation issued this week by the National Transportation Safety Board, the plane's vertical stabilizer likely separated because of ""the first officer's unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs."" But those inputs were likely caused in part by ""characteristics of the Airbus A300-600 rudder system design."" Two families of Airbus planes use a system design that limits available rudder pedal deflection as airspeed decreases, according to the safety board. ""Consequently, at high airspeeds require lighter pedal forces ... to obtain maximum available rudder than at low speeds,"" the safety board wrote. The safety board notes the circumstances of flight 587 are similar to a 2008 accident involving an Airbus Industrie A319. Air Canada Flight 190 experienced ""in-flight upset"" and landed in Calgary. Three passengers suffered serious injuries. The popular Airbus A320 family could also be affected. The European-based company's website says it sold more than 3,200 A320 planes worldwide. ""The Airbus 320 family is also susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeeds,"" the safety board  wrote. Safety board officials recommended the European Aviation Safety Agency review options for modifying some Airbus planes ""to provide increased protection from potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs."" No one from Airbus was immediately available for comment early Saturday.","Federal officials say some Airbus planes have a potentially hazardous rudder system design .

1844,"Hong Kong (CNN) -- North Korea says its scientists have concluded their investigation into the failure of the country's long-range rocket launch last week, but it declined to divulge why the flight ended in a trail of debris strewn across the sea. Experts have ""wound up the specific and scientific probe into the cause"" of the rocket's failure to put a satellite into orbit, the official Korean Central News Agency said in a report late Thursday without elaborating on what the cause was. Pyongyang had insisted that the purpose of the launch was to send an ""earth observation satellite"" into space. But the United States, South Korea and Japan called the operation a ballistic missile test in disguise. ""All the scientific and technological data and precious experience gained this time will serve as a very precious boon to space development and a reliable guarantee for greater success in the days ahead,"" the KCNA report said, citing an unidentified spokesman for the Korean Committee for Space Technology. The rocket flew for only about a minute and half after its take off on April 13 before it broke into pieces above the Yellow Sea. On Monday, the U.N. Security Council condemned the failed launch, saying it was ""a serious violation"" of previous council resolutions and ""has caused grave security concerns in the region."" North Korea said in the state media report Thursday that it had ""never recognized"" the U.N. resolution on the matter, describing it as ""a product of sinister intentions of the hostile forces.""","A North Korean rocket broke apart soon after take off last week .

1845,"(CNN) -- A power supply problem left passengers stuck on Eurostar trains between Britain and France for several hours on Monday and early Tuesday, the high-speed rail company said. The glitch in the overhead electricity lines on the French side of the tunnel under the English Channel caused big delays on trains running in both directions. Eurostar, the company that operates the service, canceled several trains Monday and experienced ""severe delays totaling many hours on others,"" said a company spokeswoman. Some trains were still between stations at 1:45 a.m. Tuesday in Britain, she added. The train operator has also canceled four trains scheduled for Tuesday and expects more delays, the spokeswoman said, since the power supply problem means the trains can't use the high-speed lines they usually travel on. CNN's Juliet Mann was trying to get from Paris to London by Eurostar on Monday afternoon. ""It was very obvious as we trundled through the French countryside that we had been diverted from our usual route,"" she said, saying the train driver made regular stops to check for status updates via fax. ""We pulled into (London's) St. Pancras (station) four hours later than planned after the scenic tour of northern France,"" she said. Eurostar gave passengers regular updates and glasses of water, and offered them a complimentary round-trip journey, Mann said. The travel disruption took place at an inconvenient time for the fashion world, coming near the end of a week of Pret A Porter shows in Paris. The Eurostar runs a route between London and Paris, stopping in some cases at smaller towns in between.

1846,"Florence, Italy (CNN) -- The captain of the shipwrecked cruise liner Costa Concordia faced a closed-door hearing Monday over whether he should remain under house arrest. Francesco Schettino faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship after the vessel struck rocks and rolled onto its side in the waters off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13. Sixteen bodies have been recovered, and 16 people remain missing from the roughly 4,200 people who were aboard the cruise liner. One of Schettino's lawyers, Salvatore Parascandola, said the defense team was ""optimistic"" that he would be freed from house arrest. ""We don't think that any of the (justifications) for Schettino's house arrest are valid. He is not going to escape or to repeat the crime,"" Parascandola said. Prosecutor Stefano Pizza did not speak to reporters as he entered or left the court. Prosecutors want Schettino's house arrest revoked and the captain sent back to jail to await trial. By law, the three-judge panel has three days to reach a verdict on house arrest. In his answers to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge investigating the case last month, Schettino admitted he made a ""mistake"" in striking the rocks. ""I hit this projection of rock that seems almost stuck into the ship, but this was my mistake,"" Schettino said, according to a 126-page transcript. ""... There isn't anything I can say, as I was convinced that passing within .28 of a mile there wouldn't be any problem."" The captain also brushed aside suggestions that at 15 knots, he was going too fast, as alleged by prosecutors. ""There isn't a speed limit,"" he said. ""... We had more or less the speed needed to reach Savona on time."" According to the transcript, Schettino said he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking. ""This is what allowed me to limit the tilting,"" he said. Maritime lawyer Jim Allsworth said the maneuver is ""fairly standard"" in the case of a ship taking on water and in danger of sinking or capsizing. ""The best thing to do is to put it aground to stop it sinking."" But in statements made during a phone conversation with a friend, Schettino said managers pressured him to steer the ship to the area where the collision occurred, two Italian newspapers reported Wednesday. La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera published excerpts from a telephone conversation Schettino had with a friend after his January 14 arrest. The captain called his friend from the prosecutor's office, and authorities tapped the phone, the newspapers said. ""In my place, someone else wouldn't have been so benevolent to have gone right under there, because they have pissed me off, go, go there,"" Schettino said, in an apparent reference to getting close to the island, according to the newspapers. ""The shallows were there, but it wasn't signaled by the instruments that I had, and I went through ... in order to follow what the managers wanted."" Schettino attorney Alessandro Antichi confirmed the wiretap but would not comment on the conversation. The information should not have been published, he said, as it is part of the investigation. The man behind the steering wheel, Jacob Rusli Bin, told investigators that after the ship struck the rocks, Schettino cursed and said he had not seen them, La Repubblica reported. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Schettino's behavior. Costa cannot conduct an independent investigation because prosecutors seized the ship's data recorder. The recorder had some connection problems but is working, Costa chief executive Per Luigi Foschi has said. It contains conversation recordings and navigation system data, he said. Cruise ship passengers described a scene of panic and confusion as they rushed for lifeboats. Some said the crew seemed overwhelmed and did not have accurate information on what was taking place. In the transcript, Schettino also described the chaos, saying that he helped passengers onto lifeboats and that some became stuck because of the angle of the listing ship. He said he was trying to launch a lifeboat when he realized he was no longer on board. ""I was then on the lifeboat. It isn't as if I had boarded it,"" he said. ""Look, I fell on its roof."" However, in the wiretapped conversation, Schettino told the friend, ""When I understood that the ship was tilting, I decided to leave, and left,"" according to Corriere della Sera. A captain's leaving the ship with passengers still aboard is difficult to defend, said Italian criminal defense attorney Ugo Meucci, who does not represent Schettino. ""This is a very difficult position because our law is very strong, and the risk is very high for the captain,"" who could face a 15-year jail sentence, Meucci said. CNN's Dan Rivers and Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report.","Schettino faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship .

1847,"(CNN) -- One woman died and at least eight other people were hospitalized after being exposed to an odor at a McDonald's restaurant in eastern Georgia, a police chief said Thursday. Police and fire personnel were called to one of the chain's restaurants in Pooler, just west of Savannah, about 11:50 a.m. Wednesday, Pooler Police Chief Mark Revenew said. Upon arrival, first responders found two people unconscious in the women's restroom and also ""became stricken (by) an odor,"" according to Revenew. Pooler Fire Chief Wade Simmons said crews ""immediately backed out and put on their breathing apparatus,"" at which point they re-entered the bathroom. The stench notwithstanding, Revenew said, authorities were able to bring the women outside and begin providing medical attention, including CPR. Nine people, including three firefighters, were transported to a local hospital. The nine included Anne Felton, 80, of Ponte Vedra, Florida, who died. The police chief said that although an investigation is under way, authorities do not anticipate filing criminal charges. ""It appears to be an accident,"" Revenew said. The chief did not offer any other details, including the cause or nature of the toxic fumes. And in a statement released through McDonald's corporate offices, franchise owners John and Monique Palmaccio said ""authorities have been unable to determine the cause of the incident."" The owners noted that the restaurant reopened Wednesday afternoon after authorities, following a ""thorough investigation,"" ""deemed (the location) to be safe."" ""(We) are deeply saddened by this tragic incident,"" the Palmaccios said, adding that they are continuing to work with authorities. ""The safety of our customers and employees has and will continue to be our number one concern.""

1848,"(CNN) -- A grassroots group is pushing to have the sites of two levee breaches during Hurricane Katrina placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The group's founder said Thursday that the mission is to change the belief that the storm caused the flooding in New Orleans after Katrina struck in 2005, killing hundreds across six states, with a majority of fatalities in Louisiana. ""It was engineering failure,"" said Sandy Rosenthal, who also serves as the director of the group, Levees.org. The two nominated sites, which caused most of the flooding in New Orleans, are the 17th Street Canal and the Industrial Canal near the Lower 9th Ward, which is owned by the corps. Levees.org filed a nomination in August requesting the two sites be designated as national historic sites. The New Orleans Army Corps of Engineers said it's following the nomination process, but is concerned about the impact it will have on future levee lifts. ""There is no need to worry ... we are not nominating the levees and floodwalls, we are nominating the site,"" Rosenthal said. Many state and local officials support the initiative to have the sites recognized, including Mayor Mitch Landrieu's office and the city of New Orleans. The 39-page application was reviewed by a state preservation panel on November 17, where it was struck down 6-3. The Corps' federal preservation officer has 60 days from the date the office receives the nomination for review. According to the corps, they have the ability to approve, request additional information or make changes. The state office of historic preservation, which is under the jurisdiction of the lieutenant governor's office, will work with Levees.org to address concerns by the corps preservation officer and rework the application if necessary. It is unknown whether the corps federal reservation officer has received the application, according to Jacques Berry, spokesman for the lieutenant governor's office. Once the corps preservation officer gets the application, a response is due in 60 days. The National Park Service will make the final decision if the corps and Levees.org agree on the eligibility and the supporting documents for the nomination. The National Register of Historic Places was established in 1966 to recognize places worthy of preservation nationwide.","The two nominated sites caused most of the flooding in New Orleans .

1849,"(CNN) -- The king of the South Pacific nation of Tonga died ""peacefully"" Sunday at a hospital in Hong Kong, a Tongan government official said Monday. He was 63. A cause of death has not been released by the government. ""Tonga has just woken up to the sad news of the passing of King George Tupou V,"" said Paula Ma'u, an official in the Ministry of Information and Communication. ""We are all in mourning."" Ma'u said Crown Prince Tupouto'a Lavaka, heir to the throne, was with the king ""just before he passed away."" Pesi Fonua, editor of Matangi Tonga online news website, said the Oxford-educated king was known for his world travel and spending habits, but was also respected for his efforts to bring democratic reforms and modernize Tongo. ""This king brought in things like mobile phones and other advances that we couldn't dream would come to Tonga, and his push for democracy made a big impact on the people here,"" Fonua said. However, he said, Tongans had ""mixed feelings here in the community"" about the king. ""He lived a bachelor life, always a single man, and he traveled a lot around the world and spent money. He brought us in some ways forward into the 21st century, but some people have different -- not as good -- views on him."" Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed her condolences in a statement Monday, crediting George V with guiding ""his country through a critical process of constitutional change towards the establishment of a constitutional monarchy."" Tonga, with a population of 106,000, is the only monarchy that remains in the Pacific. George V ascended to the throne after the death of his father in September 2006 and quickly promised to speed up government reforms demanded by the people. ""Let us rebuild a new capital and a new Tonga,"" George V said in 2006, a week after a pro-democracy rally in the capital city of Nuku'alofa led to riots that left eight people dead and the central business district in ruins. In 2008, he announced he was giving up most of the near-absolute power that his family held for centuries and allowing the prime minister to guide the day-to-day governmental affairs. Tonga is an archipelago of 171 islands directly south of Western Samoa. Less than a third of the islands are inhabited. The present dynasty was founded in 1845 after the Tongan islands were first united.

1850,"(CNN) -- A blue car rushes by in the raging brown water. Moments later a whole family house is carried down the center of the flooded street before an even more frightening sight: a young man trapped in the rising water clinging to a telephone wire. ""Gambatte kudasai!"" screams out a young voice to the stranded victim, which means ""stay strong"" in Japanese. That voice belongs to 16 year old Mao Takahashi, who used his camera to record the moment the tsunami struck his neighborhood in Ishinomaki, Japan, on March 11, 2011. Send in your memories of Japan's tsunami . It is riveting to watch and has been viewed more than two million times on YouTube. When asked if he felt as if he was recording history for a global audience, Takahashi said he did not think about what he was doing or that he might be recording a piece of history. ""I was simply panicking,"" he explained. In Japan every person in the country has at least one mobile phone and when the tsunami tore across northern Japan, thousands like Takahashi pulled out a device from their pockets and started filming, making last year's disaster one of the most recorded in history. ""Because you had all of this very real footage, it made the incident much more real in people's minds. They no longer have to imagine what a tsunami is, they saw it live,"" said Tokyo-based technology consultant Steve Nagata. Nagata points out that Japan is recognizable to many people, even if they haven't visited the country. That familiarity helped people around the world connect to the disaster. The personal nature of the video also brought the disaster home to people around the world and compelled nations and individuals to engage and want to help, said Nagata. ""To be able to do this in near real time and to do it to audiences across the globe is unprecedented in how much power it's giving to individuals,"" Nagata said. In Takahashi's case, what his video doesn't show when he stopped recording is the most important part of his story. Takahashi took off his clothes, fearing their weight when they got wet and waded into the frigid waters, which had subsided as the tsunami retreated. He then grabbed the young man clinging to the telephone wire -- who was just a few years older than himself -- and carried him back into his house. He doesn't know what happened to the young man, other than he survived. Takahashi and his family are now living in temporary housing and their future is still uncertain; he doesn't know where they will finally end up. He still likes to look at the video that's still on his camera, even though it shows the fury of that traumatizing day. ""It has a happy ending for me,"" he said.","Mao Takahashi recorded moment tsunami struck his home town of Ishinomaki .

1851,"Seattle (CNN) -- While snow and ice continued to fall in parts of the northwest, others in the region struggled with the aftermath of the same winter storm -- including floods, slick roads, power outages and avalanche warnings. The system itself remained a threat, with winter storm warnings from the National Weather Service in effect Thursday night for parts of eight states -- Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. Yet fresh precipitation was just one of many continuing concerns. Chief among them was flooding, particularly in western Oregon and southwest Washington. Oregon's capital city, Salem, which is situated along the Willamette River, issued an emergency declaration Thursday afternoon. By then, at least 35 roadways had flooded and the Red Cross had set up a shelter amid fears that the situation will worsen. ""Water levels are projected to continue to rise,"" the city said in a statement, noting that the Willamette River is projected to crest in the city at 30 feet around 4 p.m. on January 20. Flooding is also a concern elsewhere along that river, including in Harrisburg, Corvallis, Albany and Oregon City. The city of Turner was evacuating about 50 families, including 30 to 40 elderly people, said Beth Myers-Shenai, spokeswoman for the Marion County Emergency Coordination Center. A shelter was also being set up as a precaution in the nearby town of Aumsville, she said. Floods contributed to a car accident in Albany on Wednesday night, said Wanda Omdahl, a spokeswoman for the Albany Fire Department. One car full of people drove into deep water and was swept into a canal. An adult and child were rescued, and a child's body was recovered, CNN affiliate KPTV reported. Fire officials still haven't said how many people are missing. Zach Williams told the station that he and a friend saw the driver steer into a swollen creek, perhaps thinking it was a road. ""I did what I thought I could. I tried to open the doors. The doors were obviously locked. When he broke the window, I assumed the child in the back was old enough to get out through the window,"" Williams said. ""Apparently, it was just an infant."" People in some mountainous areas were told to be on guard for avalanches. The National Weather Service noted that ""heavy new snow"" falling on top of a ""weak snowpack"" heightened the threat in sections of Washington, Montana, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming. In more populated sections around Washington state, many restaurants closed, hotels full and roads cluttered by fallen trees Thursday. Around Sammamish, south of Redmond, dozens of cars were parked on steep hillsides -- evidently stranded there by drivers. And CNN affiliate KOMO showed images of overturned vehicles and carports and awnings that collapsed under the weight of the snow. Even after the worst of the snow and ice had passed, electricity outages remained a major headache. Approximately 230,000 Puget Sound Energy customers were without power as of 4 p.m. Thursday, the utility said on its Twitter feed. The company said it had over 750 workers on the job, adding that ""an additional 140 power line crews from other parts of the country will be assisting (with) repairs and restoration work."" ""We can't make full estimate of how long the restoration effort will take until the ice and snow storm -- and the damage it's causing -- ends and our crews can make a comprehensive assessment of the damage,"" the utility wrote. ""But right now, we think it will be 3 to 4 days...maybe longer."" Around Seattle, city spokesman Bryan Stevens said that about 2,200 households didn't have power late Thursday afternoon. But he said he expects all those to have electricity again by midnight. Pacific Power reported only minimal outages in Washington, California and Oregon, including about 600 around Hood River, Oregon, who were expected to have their lights on again by midnight. Roads remained perilous in large parts of Washington late Thursday, though the situation had improved markedly since earlier in the day. The Washington State Department of Transportation noted, on its website, that disabled vehicles and collisions had caused back-ups on many major highways including I-5, I-90 and I-405. ""Collisions and tree limbs are piling up on state highways,"" the Washington State Department of Transportation reported at midday Thursday on its website. CNN iReporter Lauren Miles said the Capitol Hill area of Seattle, where she lives, received more than 4 inches of snow. ""The streets are not very drivable,"" she said Thursday. ""Most businesses are closed again today. Most hills near me have turned into places to sled instead of drive."" The storm also stranded scores of air travelers Thursday at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which got 6.8 inches of snow on Wednesday, shattering a 1954 record of 2.9 inches, officials said. By late Thursday afternoon, all three of the airport's runways were open -- after two of them had been closer earlier -- spokesman Perry Cooper said. But he noted that some flights then were still being canceled, because ice was being removed from 70 to 80 planes that had been parked overnight Wednesday at the airport. Even though the state hadn't received requests for assistance ""so far,"" Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire proclaimed a state of emergency Thursday ""purely (as) a precautionary measure."" The step would allow for the activation of National Guard troops and give state agencies more options to help cities and towns. ""I want to make sure we have every resource available to ensure our communities are safe,"" Gregoire said in a statement. The governor took action to ensure the delivery of dairy products with ""a brief waiver of the restrictions on truck drivers' work hours."" The measure ""is needed now to avoid shipment delays that could mean the loss of nearly $1 million a day for the state's dairy industry,"" Gregoire said.

1852,"(CNN) -- Initial tests detected blood on a comforter found in a storage unit in Washington state belonging to Josh Powell, the man who police say killed his two sons and himself, according to a document filed Friday. It was not immediately clear who the blood belonged to or how much investigators found on the comforter, which was among the items inside a unit at Western Self Storage in Sumner, Washington. The property report from authorities indicated succinctly that a ""presumptive test"" of the comforter had tested positive for blood. Prior to setting a deadly fire Sunday at his Puyallup, Washington, home, Josh Powell was the only person identified by law enforcement authorities in West Valley City, Utah, as someone they were investigating in the disappearance of his wife, Susan Cox-Powell. According to a search warrant request by Pierce County, Washington, Sheriff's Detective Ryan Salmon, last Sunday ""several people began calling 911 saying they had received e-mails from Joshua Powell, telling them goodbye, that he could not live without his kids, and to take care of several things related to his finances."" Before authorities arrived, Powell is accused of snatching his young sons from a social worker who was delivering them for a supervised visit, locking the door, hacking the kids with a hatchet and starting an explosive fire in the home. The search warrant request noted that the medical examiner's office found ""sharp impact wounds ... on the back of the head of the two children,"" that a hatchet was recovered near their bodies, and that ""accelerant was apparently used on the bodies."" According to the detective, Powell last visited the storage unit on the day before he was accused of committing the double murder-suicide. That same day, he withdrew $6,500 in cash from a bank -- money that is ""unaccounted for,"" the document said. In addition to the comforter, authorities took two plastic bins with miscellaneous items, a box with blocks, a white garbage bag filled with children's clothes and linens, another bag with toys and framed photos from the storage unit. Most of those items were handed over to relatives of Cox-Powell, the property report states. Funeral services for the two slain boys -- Charlie, 7, and Braden Powell, 5 -- will be held Saturday. Josh Powell had said that he last saw Susan in December 2009, after he and his two sons left after midnight to go camping in below-freezing weather in a desert area in Tooele County, Utah. Cox-Powell's sister eventually reported the mother, who would now be 29 years old, as missing. A month later, Powell and his children moved from Utah to Washington.","Washington authorities search a storage unit belonging to Josh Powell .

1853,"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- The body of a girl whose disappearance triggered a public outcry in Argentina was found naked inside a garbage bag in Buenos Aires Wednesday afternoon, authorities said. It was a tragic ending to the story of Candela Rodriguez, 11, who became an icon and symbol for the more than 200 missing children in the country. ""My God, they killed my daughter!"" Candela's mother, Carola Labrador, shouted at the scene after identifying the body, the state-run Telam news agency reported. Candela's family went to the media immediately after she went missing on August 22. But it was when social media sites like Twitter picked up and shared her case that Candela became a top story. Argentinean celebrities called for her safe return home, and President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner met with Labrador. But all the attention did not save the young girl. On Thursday, people placed cards and candles in a makeshift memorial at her home. Police are investigating the motive for Candela's kidnapping and killing, though early indications point to an extortion plot against her father. Candela's father, Alfredo Rodriguez, is serving a three-year prison sentence for belonging to a ""street pirate"" gang, Telam reported. The girl's aunt received a call after her disappearance from someone who threatened to kill Candela if her father did not return some money he owed, the agency reported. Police located a house in which they believe Candela was held and were searching it, Telam reported. Her body was found in a lot where a demolished building once stood, by someone who was sifting through trash there.","Candela Rodriguez was missing since August 22 .

The venerated producer ""brought soul music and dance to the world in a way that it had never been shown, and he was a cultural game changer on a global level,"" Sharpton continued. ""Had it not been for Don Cornelius, we would not have ever transcended from the Chitlin circuit to become mainstream cultural trendsetters."" Music industry heavyweight Quincy Jones echoed that sentiment. ""I am shocked and deeply saddened at the sudden passing of my friend, colleague, and business partner Don Cornelius,"" Jones says in a statement. ""Don was a visionary pioneer and a giant in our business. Before MTV there was 'Soul Train,' that will be the great legacy of Don Cornelius. His contributions to television, music and our culture as a whole will never be matched. My heart goes out to Don's family and loved ones."" Singer and actor Tyrese Gibson posted on his Twitter page, ""First day of black history month... We lost (a) legend today .. RIP Don Cornelius I will never forget our laughs and moments..! Bless you.!!"" Televison personality Tavis Smiley said, ""Don Cornelius was our cultural ambassador at a time when Black music, Black dance and Black fashion were underappreciated.""","Many express their grief on Twitter .

1856,"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The scene after a bomb exploded in the center of Oslo on Friday reminded New Yorker Ian Dutton of what he witnessed after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States. The scale of the Oslo explosion was smaller than that of 9/11, but the stunned feeling and confusion in the aftermath were eerily similar. ""Seeing the emergency response gives me that same feeling in my spine of being in someone's crosshairs,"" Dutton said. The roads near the government buildings that were the target of the attack were free of most people except emergency responders, whose reflective yellow jackets contrasted with their surroundings. Debris covered the streets -- pieces of metal, poles and glass littered the area. Photos from the state-run broadcaster NRK showed emergency personnel putting people on stretchers and wheeling them through the debris from the blast. Video showed one government building with its windows mostly blasted out along one side. The blast could be felt for miles, witnesses said. ""It rocked me out of bed,"" Dutton said. ""The building that sustained the explosion had a helipad on its roof and now has beams hanging from it,"" Dutton said. Most of the windows were blown out, and curtains were dangling. ""I can see the warped metal of the building,"" he said. There was a line of yellow ambulances by the scene, and a police cordon kept onlookers back. ""I didn't know Oslo had so many ambulances,"" he said. ""Everything is like a movie,"" said Paul Ronneberg, who works three blocks from the explosion. ""You can feel some kind of mystic energy surrounding the town. It's very quiet. Most of the city center is closed of the police. The smiling Norwegian people aren't smiling anymore."" Emily Anderson, a 22-year-old waitress from Fargo, North Dakota, was in Norway on her second day of a family vacation. ""I was in a store with a younger sister and a younger cousin and we were in there shopping and heard a humongous bang and felt an explosion,"" she said. ""We were on a lower level of a store and when we heard it, we gathered at the front doorway of the store. You could see tons of smoke pouring out of this building. It was extremely loud."" Others on the street appeared to be in shock, she said. ""I thought we were going to die. It was scary. It felt like 9/11."" ""It sounded like a thunderclap, but louder than a thunderclap could be,"" said Anderson's 33-year-old cousin, Dawn Lubka, a nurse from Minneapolis who was in her room at the Comfort Hotel Borsparken in Oslo when the blast occurred. She said she initially assumed it was a construction accident, as there are lots of new buildings and a new opera center going up nearby. But when she looked online, she found out what had really happened. ""I asked the concierge, politically, why would they have bombings here? The Norwegians couldn't believe that it could be a bombing in their city. He said, honestly, 'It's because we're friends with you. Because (Norway) is helping with troops in Afghanistan.'"" Morten Vaage said he was about 800 meters from the explosion when it occurred after he had attended a parade to welcome his brother and other soldiers back from Afghanistan. At the parade, the Norwegian defense minister, Grete Faremo, had addressed the soldiers ""and emphasized how lucky we are to live in this country of Norway, where we are safe and free,"" he said. The explosion soon after contrasted sharply with her words. ""It did not feel like Norway,"" he said. ""I heard the explosion and the whole central (train) station shook. ... People were shocked; some were crying, some were bleeding."" Ulrik Fredrik Thyve was finishing a day's work when he heard the ""huge, enormous bang."" ""The explosion was immense; my office felt like it contracted, expanded, and windows were blown all over the building,"" he said. ""Dust, smoke, people bleeding everywhere. I walked out and towards ground zero to see if there was anything to do."" Police evacuated him and his co-workers from the area. Nick Soubiea, an American-Swedish tourist in Oslo, said he was less than 100 yards from the blast, which he described as deafening. ""It was almost in slow motion, like a big wave that almost knocked us off our chairs,"" he told CNN. ""It was extremely frightening."" He said the streets were crowded with people trying to get away from the center of the city. ""There are people running down the streets, people crying, everyone's on their cell phones calling home,"" he said. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Nicole Saidi, Carly Costello, Jesicca Ellis, Joe Sterling and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","NEW: ""The smiling Norwegian people aren't smiling any more,"" says one witness .

1857,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A high-frequency radar in California detected the March 11 tsunami that devastated Japan, raising hopes for the development of a new early warning system, a University of California at Davis oceanographer said. It was the first time a tsunami has been observed on radar, said Professor John Largier, an oceanographer at the University of California at Davis and an author of a new paper describing the work. ""We have the hardware set up. We have the system operational. It's a software challenge that we show we can achieve"" for the West Coast, Largier told CNN Tuesday. His paper appears this month in the journal Remote Sensing. A consortium of universities in California already has a high-frequency radar system set up for the West Coast to detect changes in the ocean's currents. To develop an early warning system for tsunamis on the West Coast, software would be needed, Largier said. Such a detection system could provide a 15-minute warning for a tsunami approaching northern California and an early warning of an hour for southern California, where the shallow continental shelf along the coast is bigger, Largier said. The U.S. East Coast and southeast Asia would have to set up a system and software from scratch, but an early detection system could provide an hour's warning for the Eastern Seaboard and several hours for southeast Asia, where the coastal shallow waters are much bigger, Largier said. For the past decade, Largier and his colleagues have used a high-frequency radar array at the university's Bodega Marine Lab to study ocean currents off California. That radar array is state-funded, but researchers are concerned about the costs of continuing to operate it, Largier said. Researchers from Hokkaido and Kyoto universities in Japan and San Francisco State University and Largier used data from radar sites at Bodega Bay; Trinidad, Calif.; and two sites in Hokkaido, Japan, to look for the tsunami offshore. The radar doesn't pick up the actual tsunami but rather changes in currents as the wave travels, the scientists said. As the waves enter shallower coastal water over the continental shelf, they slow down, increase in height and decrease in wavelength, the scientists said.","A tsunami has been observed for the first time on radar, an oceanographer says .

1858,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Authorities in California on Friday identified the man whose severed head, hands and feet were discovered this week as 66-year-old Hervey Medellin. The victim was from Los Angeles, said Lt. David Smith with the Los Angeles County coroner's office. Earlier in the day, Los Angeles police completed their biggest search in recent memory, with 120 investigators scouring seven acres in the Hollywood hills looking for more body parts. But the search, which began Tuesday, didn't find additional limbs or a torso, and detectives were continuing their investigation, police said. Upon concluding the hillside search, police Friday reopened Bronson Canyon Park beneath the Hollywood sign and urged hikers and other recreational visitors to be careful and not walk the trails alone. The body parts happened to be located near the home of actor Brad Pitt, and authorities interviewed his bodyguard for possible leads, police said Thursday. ""It's standard procedure for us to have our detectives canvass the neighborhood,"" Los Angeles Police Cmdr. Andrew Smith said. The bodyguard saw nothing unusual, he added. Meanwhile, the dog walker whose golden retriever, Ollie, discovered the head in a park Tuesday below the Hollywood sign said she at first thought the head was a movie prop. ""Our assumption was that there was always people filming up there, and it was a prop,"" Lauren Kornberg, who was walking with her mother at the time, told HLN. ""We walked down the ravine and got closer and realized it was a freshly severed human head."" Authorities believe the dismemberment occurred in a place other than the park, Smith said. Officers, coroner's investigators, helicopters, all-terrain vehicles, a SWAT team trained in climbing skills and mounted officers searched the section of Bronson Canyon, next to Griffith Park, Smith said. The coroner's cadaver dog located the two hands and two feet scattered across the brushy and steep terrain, police said. Authorities believe the human remains were placed in one spot and then were spread by wild animals, Smith said. The body parts were hidden until the animals found them. ""You could say it was a determined effort to hide them,"" Smith said of the body parts, declining to elaborate. A search on Wednesday located first one hand, about 50 yards from where the head was found. Another hand and then two feet were found just before waning daylight forced an end to that day's search, police said. The real-life Hollywood mystery began Tuesday afternoon as Kornberg and her mother were walking dogs in the park below the Hollywood sign. In the interview with HLN, Kornberg said she was walking eight dogs when one of them, the golden retriever named Ollie, ran away from her. Kornberg was joined by her mother, who was walking her own dog. ""We were wandering the trail and the dogs are sniffing around, and he (Ollie) pulled away from me and made a beeline for some brush. He was barking,"" Kornberg said. ""A few minutes later, he had something in his mouth, which he immediately dropped,"" Kornberg said. The object rolled down the ravine, Kornberg said. Kornberg and her mother discovered it was a human head belonging to what she described as a white man. ""We were pretty much gasping, saying, 'Oh, my God!' I was shaking. It felt like a script,"" Kornberg said. ""It still doesn't feel real."" The secluded trails, adjacent to Griffith Park, are a favorite place for residents, including many celebrities, to walk their dogs or hike. The coroner's office is examining whether the man was dead when the dismemberment occurred, and what kind of instrument may have been used to remove the head and limbs, Smith said. Police don't have a theory on what happened. ""Right now, we're keeping an open mind ... on why this poor person was dismembered and deposited up there,"" Smith said. Detectives estimated the man had been dead since Sunday. CNN's Mike Martinez, Irving Last, Alan Duke, Rosalina Nieves and HLN's Selin Darkalstanian contributed to this report.","The victim is identified as 66-year-old Hervey Medellin .

1859,"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A faulty thermometer is likely to blame for rising temperatures inside a stricken nuclear reactor at the Fukushima-Daiichi plant, authorities said Monday, as Japan prepares to mark one year since a devastating earthquake and tsunami triggered a nuclear meltdown. The plant's operators, Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) said temperatures inside the Reactor Pressure Vessel of Unit 2 have been gradually increasing since February 2 and on Monday hit a high of 89.2 degrees Celsius. The reading is significant because an error margin of 20 degrees Celsius for the gauges takes the temperature well above 100 degrees Celsius, one of the pre-conditions for a ""cold shutdown."" Japan declared the shattered plant was in ""cold shutdown"" last December, a welcome milestone in a fraught battle to contain one of the world's worst nuclear disasters. Should we be concerned? A nuclear expert agreed that a faulty temperature gauge inside the Unit 2 reactor is the most likely cause for the higher heat reading. Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants, told CNN that the prospect of another catastrophic explosion at the Fukushima-Daiichi is ""virtually zero."" Scientists warn of Tokyo quake threat . ""If the reactor was going to become critical it would have become critical in March of last year, not now,"" he said. Another possible, though less likely, explanation, according to Friedlander, is that re-routing of pipe work in the last month or so has inadvertently taken cooling water away from where it was needed. How has TEPCO responded? Under Japanese nuclear safety regulations, operators are obliged to begin cooling methods when temperatures rise above 80 degrees Celsius. Authorities at the Fukushima plant have been pumping more water and boric acid into the feed water system and into the core spray system in attempt to bring the temperature down. Boric acid is included in the water to mop up stray neutrons. TEPCO said the higher reading is at odds with temperatures taken at other points within the reactor which indicates that it's probably faulty. ""Following our cooling efforts temperatures at the two other locations are declining steadily while that at the location in question keeps rising. This leads us to think that the thermometer at the location in question is not functioning properly, rather than the actual temperature rising,"" Junichi Matsumoto, TEPCO spokesman, said Monday. The company said it has also been analyzing gas levels within the building and says there's been no increase in radiation, or any other reading that would indicate that the reactor is heating up. TEPCO said it was continuing to monitor the situation. What happens if the temperature gauge is correct and the reactor is heating up? According to Friedland, one year on from the accident the amount of residual heat and radioactivity inside all three stricken reactors is relatively low. ""In the worst case scenario, if they were to completely lose injection and lose the cooling impact, the water in there would heat up and at some point it would begin to boil. And at some point they would have to get rid of that heat, but we're talking about something that would transpire in a matter of days and weeks, not in a matter of minutes and hours,"" he said. He said the greatest risks the reactors now pose are to the environment, and that any threats to the surrounding area pale in comparison to the devastation already delivered. ""The biggest real risk is that a pipe breaks and that hundreds of thousands of gallons of highly radioactive water ends up underground or ends up leeching back into the ocean or something like that. That's the real bottom line."" What is the state of the stricken reactors? It's been almost one year since an 8.9-magnitude earthquake sent a tsunami on a collision course with the Japanese coast killing more than 15,000 people, wiping out whole villages and industries and threatening nuclear mayhem. A hydrogen explosion then fire at the Fukushima-Daiichi plant triggered a nuclear emergency on a scale not seen since the Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine in 1986. Amid criticism that it was acting too slowly and indecisively in the face of disaster, TEPCO flooded three of its unstable reactors with water. It continues to do so while efforts continue towards long-term recovery. ""The reactors are no more or no less stable than they were in April of last year. They fundamentally continue to be reliant on a feed-and-bleed cooling mechanism,"" Friedland said. The other three reactors at the plant weren't operational at the time of the disaster but they've since been shutdown, as have nuclear installations across the country. Where to now? It's a long road ahead, and one that the Japanese have acknowledged could take decades to navigate. ""They have to get the spent fuel pools stabilized and that's largely done,"" Friedland said. ""The next issue is going to be getting the fuel out of the reactors, the fuel that was in the reactors when the accident occurred. That's probably going to be four or five years in the making, maybe even longer,"" he said. The disaster displaced more than 100,000 people as far away as 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the plant. The levels of radiation in the area closest to the plant are still dangerously high. TEPCO faces a staggering clean-up and compensation bill and has been forced to accept public funding to stay afloat. On Monday, the Japanese government approved an extra injection of 690 billion yen ($8.9 billion) for the troubled utility. Tokyo threatens to withhold TEPCO aid . However, trade minister Yukio Edano has threatened to block TEPCO's access to extra funds if the company doesn't grant the government sufficient voting rights.","TEPCO says a faulty temperature gauge may be behind higher readings .

1860,"(CNN) -- Debris from a cargo ship that ran aground off the coast of New Zealand last year, and split in two over the weekend, washed up on a local beach Monday. Four shipping containers also came ashore on Waihi Beach, and another seven are within a mile of the shore, Maritime New Zealand said in a statement. Police closed public access to the beach. People are being encouraged to steer clear of the water, and to report whatever debris they see. So far, the reported debris includes timber, milk powder and plastic material. ""There is inevitably going to be a lot of mess and disturbance for the next few days while this is cleaned up and we would like people to use common sense and stay well away from the debris -- in some cases this will mean staying out of the water as well as away from material washed up on the beach,"" National On Scene Commander Alex van Wijngaarden said in the statement. The Rena, a Liberian-flagged vessel, struck the Astrolabe Reef, about 12 nautical miles off the city of Tauranga, on the North Island, in October. It split in two over the weekend, triggering fears of a fresh oil spill. Hundreds of tonnes of oil have already leaked from the ship, leading New Zealand's environment minister to call the spill the country's most significant maritime environmental disaster. But on Monday, maritime officials said there is ""no indication of a significant release of oil from the Rena, although a sheen of oil is still visible off the vessel."" Between 200 and 300 containers on the ship were lost overboard when it broke in two, Maritime New Zealand said.","Police close Waihi Beach as shipping containers come ashore .

1861,"(CNN) -- The devastating wall of water that struck Japan in March was the result of at least two waves that combined to create a more powerful tsunami, U.S. scientists said Monday. Ocean ridges and mountain ranges below the surface of the water channeled the waves created by the 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Japan, bringing them together far out at sea to form a ""merging tsunami,"" according to researchers from NASA and Ohio State University. The earthquake and tsunami together killed 15,840 people, according to the most recent death toll, and set off a nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Satellite data have enabled the researchers to come up with an account of the formation of the tsunami and its destructive force. ""Nobody had definitively observed a merging tsunami until now,"" Y. Tony Song, a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in a statement. The results of the research could help predict the risks from tsunamis in the future. ""We can use what we learned to make better forecasts of tsunami danger in specific coastal regions anywhere in the world,"" said Professor C.K. Shum of Ohio State University.","Tsunami that struck Japan in March was the result of at least two waves that combined, scientists say .

1862,"(CNN) -- Authorities have recovered 54 bodies after a ferry crammed with people capsized in southern Bangladesh, police said Sunday. Among the victims were 22 children and 15 women, said Nazrul Islam, the police chief of Bhola district where the accident occurred Friday. Thirty more passengers are believed missing and presumed dead, he said. ""Hopefully, in few hours, we should be able to confirm the exact number of missing (people),"" Islam said. The boat had a capacity of 1,500 but was overcrowded with about 2,000 people who were traveling from the capital, Dhaka, to their homes in Bhola for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. The boat toppled as passengers weighted down one side to disembark, Islam said. Police and firefighters rushed to aid passengers, many of whom were trapped in the lower deck.

1863,"New York (CNN) -- Beachgoers are being warned to stay out of the water this weekend at four popular beaches around New York City after raw sewage from a Manhattan plant spilled into the Hudson River, authorities said. Health advisories also have been issued for portions of the Hudson River, the East River, the Harlem River and the Kill Van Kull, cautioning people against participating in water-related activities such as canoeing, kayaking and swimming, according to the New York City Department of Health. The sewage spill began Wednesday after a fire began in the engine room of the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant, according to a press release Friday from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. The sewage spill was stopped Friday night, and two of the engines damaged by the fire have been brought back online, the department said. The health advisories were issued for South Beach, Midland Beach and Cedar Grove Beach on Staten Island, and Sea Gate in Brooklyn, according to the release. The beaches are not closed, but the New York City Department of Health recommends that people not swim or enter the water at those locations. They also recommend that young and elderly people, as well as anyone suffering from a medical condition, not go near the water at those beaches. The advisories were expected to be in place until Monday. That would encompass one of this summer's hottest weekends, with the National Weather Service forecasting high temperatures Saturday of 99 degrees Fahreinheit and in the high 80s Sunday. Additionally, authorities were testing the waters in the harbor and at other aquatic locales that could potentially be affected by the sewage leak, the press release said. The plant is responsible for treating 120 million gallons of wastewater a day on Manhattan's west side. CNN's Jordana Ossad and Laura Batchelor contributed to this report.","A sewage spill at a Manhattan wastewater plant has been brought under control .

1864,"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- More than a thousand stranded people, cold and fearful, escaped blankets of snow and slippery roads Saturday after the Indian air force ferried them to warmer climates. In all,1,100 people on the sole highway linking the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir's winter and summer capitals -- Srinagar and Jammu -- were airlifted out of misery. People had been waiting for days for the treacherous highway to reopen after unusually heavy snowfall caused avalanches in the northern, mountainous Kashmir region. The road re-opened briefly three days ago but authorities allowed only big trucks carrying essential goods. Uncertainty set in as the highway remained unnavigable by most of vehicles. State authorities finally were forced to seek Indian military help. The highway has been closed 11 days in January. In some places, the snow has piled up several feet. More of the white stuff is forecast for Sunday. CNN's Mukhtar Ahmad contributed to this report.","NEW: 1,100 people were airlifted out .

1865,"(CNN) -- A San Francisco man was arrested and charged with murder Sunday, two days after five people were found dead in a residence in that northern California city, police said. The victims were found around 7:45 a.m. Friday in a building near the City College of San Francisco in the city's Ingleside district, said Commander Michael Biel, head of the San Francisco Police Department's investigations division. There were ""four separate homicide scenes within the residence"" -- suggesting people had been killed in four different locales -- Police Chief Greg Suhr said. Suhr said the five died ""apparently from blunt trauma, (though) we really didn't know what happened."" He added later that there also was an ""edge-weapon involved,"" capable of cutting someone, but there was no evidence of gunshots. The names and ages of those killed have not been released, though Suhr did say ""we believe that the victims may be related."" The man accused of killing them, Binh Thai Luc, is a 35-year-old San Francisco resident with a criminal record. He was arrested and booked on five counts of murder early Sunday, according to Suhr, who added Luc ""did not surrender"" and ""was not arrested at home."" His brother, 32-year-old Brian Luc, was also arrested and charged with narcotics possession, a felon in possession of ammunition and for a probation violation, according to police. The two live together in the city. The police chief said there was ""a relationship"" between the suspect and the victims, though he did not specify what that was.","5 people were found dead in San Francisco, all having suffered ""blunt trauma""

1866,"(CNN) -- A coroner has adjourned the fourth inquest into the death of a baby believed to have been killed by a dingo in central Australia more than 30 years ago. Azaria Chamberlain was just two months old when she was snatched from a tent during a family holiday to Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock, sparking one of the country's most sensational and enduring murder mysteries. Her mother, Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton, long maintained that a dingo, a wild dog native to Australia, took her baby, even as she was sentenced to life in jail for daughter's murder, a conviction that was later quashed. Her cries of a ""dingo's got my baby"" were immortalized in the 1988 film ""A Cry in the Dark,"" starring Meryl Streep who earned an Oscar nomination for the role. Outside Darwin Magistrates Court on Friday, Chamberlain-Creighton said she hoped the ruling would help educate the public about the dangers posed by dingoes. ""It gives me hope that Australia will finally realize dingoes are dangerous and hope that justice will finally be done for my daughter as well,"" she said. A ruling is expected next week. Chamberlain-Creighton is seeking to change the open verdict on her daughter's death certificate to indicate that she was taken by a dingo. ""There is a lot of new evidence. The last inquest was in 1995 and since then there have been a number of significant dingo attacks,"" said Stuart Tipple, the lawyer representing Chamberlain-Creighton and her former husband Michael. It is the fourth inquest into Azaria's death. The first inquest, in 1981, found that the baby died as a result of being taken by a dingo, but a second the following year committed her mother to trial for murder. The 35-day hearing created a media frenzy in Australia as commentators picked apart the intricacies of the case, while a fascinated public speculated wildly as to why and how Azaria had died. ""A lot of people just never believed a dingo was capable of doing it,"" Tipple said. The jury returned its verdict in 1982: Chamberlain-Creighton was found guilty of slitting her daughter's throat with a pair of scissors before hiding the body and concocting a story about a dingo to cover her crime. She was sentenced to life in jail. Her husband Michael was given a suspended sentence after being found guilty of being an accessory after the fact. The couple had two other children; two boys aged six and four at the time of Azaria's death. Chamberlain-Creighton served four years of her sentence before the Northern Territory government ordered her release in 1986 after the discovery of new evidence; a baby's jacket, believed to be Azaria's, found half-buried near a dingo lair at Uluru. In 1988, a Royal Commission set up to review the evidence formally quashed convictions for both husband and wife. Despite the finding that the couple was not to blame, a third inquest into their daughter's death returned an open verdict in 1995. It's that ruling that the Chamberlains now want changed. ""Certainly, like any parent, they want closure and they're not going to be able to get closure until the record's correct,"" Tipple said. ""At the moment an open finding is not a correct finding."" ""There's certainly a personal part in the journey but they want to warn people and make sure the tragedy doesn't occur again,"" he said. On Friday, he presented the coroner with evidence of at least 12 ""very significant"" dingo attacks in Australia since the last inquest in 1995. In one of the worst cases, a nine-year-old boy was killed, and his friend mauled, by two dingoes on Fraser Island, off the coast of Queensland, in 2001. Twenty-eight dingoes were culled in the public outcry that followed. The world's largest sand island, Fraser Island earned UNESCO World Heritage status for its ""exceptional beauty"" and its rare combination of tall rainforests and towering sand dunes. It's also home to the largest population of native Australian dingoes -- around 200 animals living in up to 30 packs -- and the site of most, if not all, dingo attacks. ""On Fraser Island the dingo has a particularly difficult role because tourists are as interested in the dingo as the dingo is interested in food,"" said Professor Gisela Kaplan, a dingo expert from the University of New England in New South Wales. ""Fear, very often, is the only thing that stands between a dangerous animal and a human. Once that fear is lost any predatory animal can become dangerous,"" she said. Dingo management strategies have been introduced in areas of the country where the mammals are prevalent. Fraser Island's includes approval to cull specific animals considered to pose a threat to humans. ""Once a dingo has lost its fear of people and starts to use aggressive tactics to gain dominance over, or food from, people the habit cannot be changed,"" according to the Queensland government's campaign ""Be dingo-safe!"" It adds: ""These dingoes display aggressive or dangerous behavior such as nipping and biting, and in some cases this escalates very quickly to attacks and serious mauling."" The Chamberlain's lawyer Stuart Tipple says that, if nothing else, the couple hopes a change in the official cause of Azaria's death makes ""public authorities more aware of their responsibilties. ""This will make them fine tune, hopefully, those plans and make them current and keep updating them,"" he said. Where once many people -- including the jury that convicted Lindy and Michael Chamberlain -- believed that it was unlikely that a dingo would kill a baby, evidence in recent years shows that is indeed possible. However, Kaplan said public opinion had swung too far the other way, and Australia's largest native predator had been unfairly ""demonized."" ""A dingo is a suitable animal to be demonized, isn't it? In one way you can know it, and in the other way it's mysterious,"" she said. Kaplan warned that if more wasn't done to protect the animals in their natural habitat, they would eventually die out. ""This is a very rare and endangered Australian native animal,"" she said. ""If that goes extinct, there will be outcry in future that we've allowed that to happen, because there are so many misconceptions about the animal.""","Inquest adjourned into death of baby believed to have been killed by dingo .

1867,"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- At least 84 Nigerian children have died after ingesting teething medicine that contained a solvent typically found in antifreeze, the country's health minister said Friday. The My Pikin teething medicine has been reomved from shops in Nigeria. Some 111 babies and children have been sickened since November by the tainted batch of My Pikin, which was found to contain diethylene glycol, which is used in some antifreeze and brake fluid. Tests on the teething formula showed high concentrations of diethylene glycol, Health Minister Babtunde Osotimehin said in a statement released Friday. Exposure to the solvent can damage the kidney, heart and nervous system, Osotimehin said, and it can be fatal. The dead ranged from age 2 months to 7 years, he said. ""The death of any Nigerian child is a great loss to the nation,"" he said. Several officials with pharmaceutical company Barewa Pharmaceutical Ltd have been charged with negligence. And the Nigeria National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, which is investigating the issue with the Ministry of Health, has shut the drug maker down. Former officials of the company could not be reached for comment. The food and drugs agency has said it believes the company thought it was buying propylene glycol, a normal ingredient in the teething medicine. The government has asked that all My Pikin teething formula be returned; however, it was not immediately clear if that had been done. Symptoms of diethylene glycol exposure include: abdominal pain; nausea or vomiting; dizziness; drowsiness; confusion; and decreased or lack of production of urine.","Drug company taints My Pikin teething medicine with antifreeze ingredient .

1868,"(CNN) -- After noticing smoke seeping inside, a North Carolina bus driver rushed six elementary school children off her vehicle moments before it burst into flames. The incident occurred Wednesday afternoon as Lindora Richardson was driving the children home from Chantilly Montessori Elementary School, a public school in Charlotte, school district spokeswoman Tahira Stalberte said. ""We are very proud of her and for her following proper procedures,"" said Stalberte, speaking on behalf of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, on Thursday. ""It could have taken a very different turn had she not done her job correctly."" Richardson told Vinnie Politan of HLN, CNN's sister network, that she was driving on her route through a Charlotte neighborhood when she detected a ""burning smell"" and pulled over to investigate. ""As that was going on, smoke started to come from under the dash of the bus,"" she recalled. At that point, Richardson guided the young students on board to the back of the bus. Describing the children as ""calm,"" she said that they exited ""one-by-one"" through the rear emergency exit. The bus driver said she and the students, ages 5 to 10, then ""walked so far up the street"" where they witnessed the smoke and flames engulf the vehicle. Video, posted on YouTube and apparently taken after the students had moved to a safe place, shows black smoke seeping out of open windows on the bus, as it sits along a residential street. Flames are then clearly visible creeping backwards from the front of the bus. Within just over a minute, fire had consumed about half the vehicle -- and shot up through the roof. There are no injuries related to the incident, Stalberte said. While describing Richardson as modest, the school district spokeswoman said that she deserves praise -- and she'll get some next week, when she is honored by the Charlotte Fire Department. ""I do have two kids, and I do love children, (and) I love my job,"" Richardson said of the satisfaction she gets working as a bus driver.

1869,"London (CNN) -- Energy giant Total was trying Wednesday to contain a gas leak that forced the evacuation of a platform off the coast of Scotland. A union representing workers on the rig warned there was an ""urgent need"" to stop the leak, which began Sunday. ""If the gas cloud somehow finds an ignition source, we could be looking at complete destruction,"" said Jake Molloy, an official with the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. ""This is an unprecedented situation and we really are in the realms of the unknown,"" Molloy said of the leak from the Elgin platform in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240 km) east of the Scottish city of Aberdeen. But oceanographer Simon Boxall said the risk of explosion may not be as high as initially feared. ""Initially the risk of explosion was seen as being very high. There were reports coming through of a large gas cloud enveloping the whole rig,"" he told CNN. But the fact that there has been no blast when the flare on the gas rig is still burning ""obviously contradicts the idea that there was a very high risk of explosion,"" he said. ""Perhaps the quantity of gas is not that great as first thought,"" he said. For the moment, the wind seems to be blowing the gas cloud away from the flare on the Elgin rig. Nearly 240 workers were taken off the rig as the problem developed Sunday, Total said in a statement. ""Investigations are ongoing to analyze the causes and to determine the remediation of the gas leak,"" the company said. Total confirmed there was a ""sheen on the water in the vicinity of the platform,"" but said there was no indication of environmental damage. There have been no injuries, the company said. Steve Todd, national shipping secretary for the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, said that while the workers were safely evacuated, they are being kept in the dark about what happened. More information is needed on what measures are being taken to prevent such a leak occurring again, he told CNN, speaking from Brussels, Belgium. ""We really need reassurances before anyone is put back out there that the danger has been cleared up altogether,"" he said. Shell partially evacuated two of its nearby platforms, Shearwater and Hans Deul, as a ""purely precautionary"" measure, it said. The Shearwater crew was reduced from 90 to 38, and the Hans Deul crew is in the process of being reduced from 106 to 38. Drilling was suspended on the Hans Deul rig, Shell UK said. The Elgin leak has echoes of the BP Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but there are significant differences. The Elgin is in significantly shallower water, which could make problems easier to fix, but it is leaking gas, rather than oil. Gas catches fire much more easily. ""This is nothing on the scale of the Gulf spill two years ago,"" Boxall said. ""This is a relatively light spill. The gas itself is dispersing quite rapidly."" But there is one parallel, he pointed out. ""Ironically, it sounds as if, just like with the Deepwater Horizon, they were closing off a well and somewhere along the line something went wrong,"" he said. ""The hope is that there is so little gas pressure in there that it will just blow itself out,"" he said of the Elgin spill. Failing that, Total may have to dig a bypass well to close off the leak from another angle, as BP did with the Gulf spill, he said. Any effect on the environment is likely to be strictly local, he predicted. Total's share price fell 7% Tuesday on news of the leak, but market analyst firm Jeffries International said Wednesday that it thought the market had overreacted. The company's value continued to fall on Wednesday, but not as sharply. It was down about 1% from the day before as of Wednesday afternoon in France, where it is traded.

1870,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Eight Ferraris, three Mercedes-Benz cars and a Lamborghini have crashed in a massive -- and very expensive -- 14-vehicle accident in southwestern Japan. The wreck took place Sunday on Chugoku Expressway in Shimonoseki, according to Yamaguchi prefectural police. One of the Ferraris skidded and collided into the central divider, setting off a chain-reaction crash. Police said some of the drivers belonged to a group of luxury car enthusiasts from Kyushu island who had gathered to tour the area together. While most of the 14 vehicles -- which also included two Toyotas -- were traveling in the same direction, a Mercedes CL600 headed in the opposite direction was hit by flying parts from the other side of the expressway. Ten drivers were hospitalized, but no one was seriously injured, police said. Witnesses told CNN affiliate TV Asahi that they saw a car speeding on the road, which was wet from recent rain.","The 14-vehicle crash also includes 3 Mercedes-Benz cars and 2 Toyotas .

1872,"Tuscaloosa, Alabama (CNN) -- The pounding of hammers inside his home is probably the sweetest sound in the world to Tuscaloosa resident Gary Limmroth. It's the sound of progress. One year ago, he barely made it into his basement as a massive tornado with winds up to 200 mph picked up his home, churned it into pieces and threw it all over his Forest Lake neighborhood. ""It sucked the air out of the room, like someone trying to beat on the door violently to get in, and then 60 seconds later, it was the quietest quiet you never heard,"" he said. Limmroth emerged unscathed and watched as the mammoth storm continued its rampage through Tuscaloosa on April 27, 2011. The twister stayed on the ground for about six minutes, officials say. Fifty-three people were killed in the city that day. ""It smelled like you had been inside a lumber mill: fresh cut from the houses that were destroyed, plus the trees that were just literally cut in half,"" Limmroth said. ""It was truly eerie."" Mother-daughter team helps raise money for Tuscaloosa . The twister was part of a severe storm system that ripped through the South and Midwest that day, killing at least 327 people. It was one of the deadliest tornado outbreaks in U.S. history. Alabama was the hardest-hit state, and Tuscaloosa was the bull's-eye of the storm. More than 5,000 homes in the city alone were damaged or destroyed, and hundreds of businesses in the area were also affected, according the West Alabama Chamber of Commerce. The storm cut a six-mile-long path through the city, destroying or damaging about 12% of it, Tuscaloosa officials say. The tornado left behind enough debris to fill the University of Alabama's football stadium five times, Mayor Walt Maddox said. On Friday, members of the Tuscaloosa community came together to remember those they lost at a remembrance ceremony held at the university. Bells tolled 53 times to honor each of the city's tornado victims. The names of the dead were read aloud and pictures of them flashed on a screen -- happy glimpses into lives cut short. The Tuscaloosa tornado was later given a rating of EF4, the second-most powerful on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, meaning it had wind speeds between 166 and 200 mph. Today, a year later, a huge weed-filled lot now sits where one Tuscaloosa neighborhood used to be -- part of the huge mile-wide swath that the tornado cut through town at McFarland Boulevard and 15th Street. Right next to that lot is Evan Smith's newly rebuilt Krispy Kreme doughnut shop. ""I'm no weatherman, but I think we're standing in the dead center eye,"" Smith said. This week, plumbers finished their work on the site of his new shop. He hopes to be back in business in the next three months. ""As bad as disasters are, a lot of people benefit from them, from easier loans, lower loans and stuff like that,"" Smith said. ""But as far as me and this business, I'm not better off until I get the doors open again."" Tuscaloosa's recovery is more about rebuilding all the homes and businesses obliterated by last year's tornado, according to the city's mayor. ""It's about restoring lives,"" Maddox said. ""It's about ensuring what happened here is more meaningful than just six miles of total destruction across our city. It's about building back in such a way that people are going to have confidence that we're going to have a better tomorrow."" ""The message is this: We are coming back,"" Tuscaloosa County Probate Judge Hardy McCollum said during the Friday ceremony. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley also spoke, vowing to stay committed to the rebuilding efforts. ""As we observe today's anniversary, let us look ahead to the work that remains to be done for the people of Alabama,"" he said. ""We've made a lot of progress in the last year. We still have a long way to go."" Today, a construction crew is putting the finishing touches on Gary Limmroth's new home, which has a poured concrete safe room. He hopes to sleep in his new place in July. ""It takes a while to figure out how do you want to build back, how do you want to do it. Do you want to come back? There were a lot of people across the lake that have decided they just can't take it. They couldn't be here, the constant reminder every day of seeing it.""","NEW: Bells toll to remember the tornado victims .

1873,"(CNN) -- A Florida highway patrolman who ordered the opening of an interstate highway, despite dense fog and smoke from a nearby brush fire, had not received any formal training on opening or closing roads and was not aware of the agency's relevant policy or procedures, according to an investigation into the deadly January crashes that left 11 people dead. Lt. John Gourley ordered the road reopened when conditions improved on Interstate 75 because he considered it dangerous not to, he told investigators, according to a state report released Thursday. Gourley cited the potential for secondary crashes as a result of prolonged road closures based on his prior experience as a reason for the decision. Despite reservations expressed by Sgt. Bruce Simmons, who said he was worried about allowing traffic to resume too soon, Gourley proceeded with the reopening. ""I'm concerned that another cloud might roll through and then we got to go through all this again,"" said Simmons, according to the report. ""That's why we need to go ahead get DOT (the Florida Department of Transportation) to get signs and assets in place if we need to shut down where we did, we can do it,"" Gourley responded. ""Keep monitoring it but right at this point, I see no reason to keep it closed."" The report said troopers did not act with criminal intent but also ""failed to adequately communicate critical information amongst themselves regarding the fire on Paynes Prairie."" Gourley was not immediately available for comment. The report also blamed the agency for failing ""to adequately create and implement effective guidelines"" for its troopers to follow when dealing with poor visibility on roadways. And those training measures in place were considered ""ineffective and poorly memorialized,"" it said. After Gourley reopened the highway, there were not adequate resources dedicated to monitor subsequent road conditions, the report found. About 20 minutes before the fatal crashes, Trooper Steven Downing reported seeing dense smoke less than a mile east of Interstate 75, where the vehicle accidents would occur. But ""no immediate measures were taken"" to monitor the conditions in that area following his report, it added. Downing later responded to a nearby crash that involved six vehicles, which occurred near Gainesville. The National Weather Service had warned that patchy smoke and fog may have been present in the area. Lidiane Carmo, 15, was injured and lost most of her family in the I-75 pileup. The teen's case drew widespread attention after church members said she was an illegal immigrant from Brazil, and they were afraid she could face deportation. But federal officials said in February that she would be allowed to stay in the country.","A January crash on Interstate 75 in Florida left 11 people dead .

1874,"(CNN) -- The National Weather Service has confirmed 59 tornadoes from a weekend outbreak of storms that killed six people. ""The Storm Prediction Center estimates the total will be around 75 when all surveys are complete,"" the weather service website said. There were initial reports of 135 tornadoes -- spread across Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma -- from the sprawling storm system that ripped across the Plains and Midwest on Saturday. A much smaller outbreak was reported Sunday. At the time, the weather service said a final confirmed count would only come after officials had a chance to fan out across the states and determine how many of the reports were indeed tornadoes. All of the fatalities were in Woodward, Oklahoma, a community of about 12,000 people, about 85 miles west of Enid. At least 29 people were injured, officials said. The weather service said the town was hit by an EF-3 tornado, packing winds of up to 165 mph. It destroyed 89 homes and 12 businesses, according to City Manager Alan Riffel. Officials credited early warning systems elsewhere in the region with preventing more fatalities. Advisories from the system were issued two days in advance, rather than just hours, and were ""remarkably accurate,"" said Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback. ""People took it very seriously."" CNN's Rob Marciano reported from Oklahoma and Maria P. White from Atlanta.","Confirmed tornadoes are expected to be around 75 .

1875,"(CNN) -- An American cruise line has said it ""deeply regrets"" the deaths of two Panamanian fishermen amid claims that one of its cruise ships failed to help their stranded boat. Princess Cruises said passengers on the Star Princess apparently alerted a crew member to the disabled fishing boat in March, but initial indications are that the captain was never told. Later that month, the Ecuadorian navy rescued the only survivor of what was meant to be an overnight fishing trip, 18-year-old Adrian Vasquez, after 28 days adrift. Since then, pressure has grown on the cruise line from local and international media to explain why it failed to help. Broadcaster NPR first reported the claim by three passengers, all bird-watchers, that they had spotted the castaways and told cruise ship staff but had seen no action taken. A reporter with the Panama-Guide.com website confirmed with Vasquez that he and his two friends, who at that point were still alive, had tried to attract the attention of the passing cruise ship. Princess Cruises ""deeply regrets that two Panamanian men perished at sea,"" its statement Thursday said. ""The preliminary results of our investigation have shown that there appeared to be a breakdown in communication in relaying the passenger's concern. Neither Captain Edward Perrin nor the officer of the watch were notified,"" it said. ""Understandably, Captain Perrin is devastated that he is being accused of knowingly turning his back on people in distress."" If Perrin had received the information, he would have been able to respond appropriately, the company said. ""We all understand that it is our responsibility and also the law of the sea to provide assistance to any vessel in distress, and it is not an uncommon occurrence for our ships to be involved in a rescue at sea,"" it said. Its ships have been involved in more than 30 rescues in the past decade, Princess Cruises added. The story of Vasquez's miraculous survival gained international coverage when he was picked up north of the GalÃ¡pagos Islands. The alert was first raised by Vasquez's parents after he and his two friends, Oropeces Betancourt, 24, and Fernando Osorio, 16, failed to return as expected to the town of Rio Hato, Panama. Local fishermen and then the Panamanian navy joined the search, sending ships and airplanes to look for the trio, to no avail. For nearly a month, their fate remained a mystery. But on March 21, fishermen spotted the boat, named the Fifty Cents, adrift nearly 600 miles from where it had launched. After being alerted by the fishermen, the Ecuadorian navy rescued Vazquez. Rear Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle said Vasquez showed ""severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition"" when he was found. He said the survivor had thrown his friends' bodies into the ocean ""because they had become badly decomposed."" Vasquez's mother, Nilsa de la Cruz, told CNN last month that she was overjoyed to have her son back. ""After 28 days of anguish, after praying to God that he be found alive ... this is indeed a miracle,"" de la Cruz said. She said her son told her the February 24 fishing trip had started out well. The three caught plenty of fish. But the boat's engine died without warning and, with no tools and scant navigational experience, there was little the trio could do, de la Cruz told CNN. Soon, currents had swept their boat out into the Pacific, far from the coast. De la Cruz said the three ate raw fish and drank rainwater. They had already been adrift for two weeks when passengers on the Star Princess apparently spotted their tiny boat as the fishermen waved for help. CNN's Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","Princess Cruises is investigating what happened after passengers raised the alert .

1876,"(CNN) -- A New Jersey woman traveling to an explosives demonstration in California was stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport after land mine casings were found in her luggage, the Transportation Security Administration said Tuesday. TSA explosives experts were called to the checked baggage screening area in Terminal C when her suitcase set off alarms. Inside the suitcase, officials found three small claymore land mine casings. Two of them were packed with shrapnel, the TSA said in a statement. There were no explosives or detonator in the bag, the statement said. The unidentified woman, from Union, New Jersey, missed her original flight to San Francisco but was allowed to rebook her flight later -- without the weapons, the TSA said. Explosive materials and realistic replicas of explosives are not permitted on planes, the TSA said.","A checked bag at Newark Liberty International Airport tripped alarms .

1877,"(CNN) -- In a New Delhi hospital, a two-year-old girl is fighting for her life after a teenager brought her there three weeks ago, unconscious with severe head injuries and bruises, fractured arms and human bite marks covering her tiny body. All of India began following her ordeal through newspapers and television. Doctors operated on the toddler, opened up her airways and placed her on a ventilator. They named her Falak, which means sky. Her condition remains critical, said Dr. Sumit Sinha of the India Institute of Medical Sciences. No one knows whether she will survive or if she does, whether she will live with permanent brain damage. But that's just the tip of the story. With each day, it becomes more sordid. Once police began investigating Baby Falak's back story, they unearthed a suspected ring of human trafficking. The details sparked new outrage among authorities and the public alike, who say the case raises a host of questions about child abandonment, exploitation and the poor treatment of girls and women in the world's second most populous nation. ""This has turned out to be one of the biggest sex rackets involving minors and child prostitution and sale of women for marriage,"" said Raaj Mangal Prasad, head of India's Child Welfare Committee. ""This shows this is a classic case where the magnitude of trafficking has come to light."" Indians came to know of Baby Falak after a distraught teenage girl, only 14, brought the baby to the hospital, claiming to be her mother. On the night of January 17, the baby just kept crying and crying, the teenager told the Child Welfare Committee in New Delhi. Angered by the tantrum, the girl slapped the baby three or four times -- and bit her. A while later, she said, the baby slipped on a wet bathroom floor and fell on her face. The girl tied a bandage around the baby's head but the wound began to swell. The next day, when the baby did not wake up, the girl took her to the hospital. The doctors said Baby Falak was bruised the color of eggplant and beets. She was in a coma. They did not believe the girl's story. Nor that she was Falak's biological mother. ""My personal opinion would be that it doesn't look like a simple case of falling down,"" said Dr. Deepak Agarwal, a neurosurgeon at the hospital. She was referred to a juvenile center for counseling and police launched an investigation. South Delhi deputy Police Commissioner Chhaya Sharma formed five teams to fan out across India to track down Falak's real family. What police learned in the subsequent weeks was shocking. The teenage girl ran away from home last June to escape abuse from her alcoholic father. The father failed to pay rent, his landlady told CNN's sister network CNN-IBN. A neighbor described him beating his daughter so hard that her red welts were readily visible. ""I have seen with my own eyes how her father used to beat her up with a stick,"" Vikram told CNN-IBN. But her escape led the teenager to more trouble. She told authorities two people, Sandeep and Arti, forced her into a life of prostitution; that Sandeep allegedly raped her first for three days before he found her customers, according CNN-IBN. Months later, the girl met a man named Rajkumar and the two began living together in a New Delhi slum. Police suspect he, too, was sexually abusing the girl. The girl told authorities that Rajkumar brought Baby Falak home in November. It's unclear whether the baby was abused then but on that January night, Falak almost died. ""Once victim hurting another victim because there is no sense of hope, sense of survival they can see for themselves,"" psychiatrist Achal Bhagat told CNN-IBN. In the western state of Rajasthan, police eventually tracked down Munni, 22, the woman believed to be Falak's biological mother. She had been abandoned by her first husband and sold off in marriage when she was 16 to a young man from a Rajasthani village, Sharma said. She was valued at $6,000, according to The Times of India. Munni left her three children behind. ""The family life was very disturbed,"" Sharma said. ""She was convinced that she would not be able to raise Falak on her own."" While Munni's youngest fought for her life in the hospital, police found her other daughter in the state of Bihar, many miles from Delhi and Rajasthan. Her son's whereabouts are still not known. Police scored a breakthrough in the case Friday when they were able to nab Rajkumar, the man they believe is central to the possible trafficking ring. He was caught absconding at the New Delhi train station, Sharma said at a news conference. In all, police have arrested 10 people so far who are believed to have profited greatly from their crimes. They are still probing. No one knows how many babies were abandoned, how many women were married off for a price or how many girls were forced to sell their bodies. The case prompted India's home ministry to review police reports and consider action and reignited national debate on a serious problem in India. A 2011 TrustLaw danger poll ranked India as the fourth most dangerous place on earth for women, behind Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring Pakistan. The survey said 100 million women and girls are involved in prostitution and 50 million are ""missing"" in the last century because of female feticide and infanticide. Almost 45% of girls are married off before they reach adulthood. Prasad of the Child Welfare Committee called the problem ""huge."" He said India needs more comprehensive laws on the books and stronger enforcement. This sort of thing happens all too often, Prasad said, and sadly, flies under the radar of a majority of India's 1.2 billion people. But now, a hapless child fighting very publicly for her life has thrust an ugly side of Indian society into the national spotlight.","Baby Falak is fighting for her life in a New Delhi hospital .

1878,"(CNN) -- A strong 6.6-magnitude earthquake struck Sunday off the coast of Antarctica, prompting a warning that there was a ""small possibility"" it could trigger a tsunami. The tremor was centered in waters south of South America's southern tip, about 334 miles (539 kilometers) west of Coronation Island and 388 miles northeast of Palmer Station in Antarctica, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. It hit at 9:40 a.m. local time (8:40 a.m. ET) on Sunday, according to the federal agency, and had an estimated depth of 6.2 miles. Afterward, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center released a statement saying that there appears to be no threat of ""destructive widespread tsunami"" because of the quake. But the agency did state ""there is a small possibility of a local or regional tsunami that could affect coasts located usually no more than a few hundred kilometers from the earthquake epicenter. ""Authorities in the region near the epicenter should be made aware of this possibility,"" the warning center added.","The quake struck Sunday morning near Antarctica's Shetland Islands .

1879,"(CNN) -- Rescue workers have located the downed Yemenia Airways plane's distress signals, but not its flight data recorders, France's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. Relatives of passengers on the doomed jet arrive at Marseille airport in southern France. The ministry clarified comments made earlier in the day by the ministry's junior minister for cooperation Alain Joyandet. He told CNN affiliate BFM TV that the ""black boxes"" -- the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder -- had been localized. ""The jet distress beacons were found, instead of the black boxes,"" the ministry later clarified. ""There could have been some confusion."" The Airbus 310 went down early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members on a flight that originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. The jet took off from Sanaa at 9:45 p.m. Monday and vanished from radar when it was about 16 miles from Comoros' capital, Moroni. The French navy and Yemeni authorities expanded search efforts for wreckage and bodies Wednesday, with a French frigate among the ships joining the search.   Watch what is known about the flight » . Searchers had recovered three bodies, Qadir said. Bahia Bakari, a 13-year-old French girl, was the only known survivor. Her mother was also on the flight, but she has not been found. The girl's father Kassim Bakari told France Info, a French radio network, that his wife and daughter were flying to Comoros to visit relatives.  Watch as airline describes child's rescue » . ""When I had her on the phone, I asked her what happened and she said, 'Daddy, I don't know what happened, but the plane fell into the water and I found myself in the water ... surrounded by darkness. I could not see anyone,'"" Bakari said. Passengers on the flight included 66 French citizens, 54 Comorians, one Palestinian and one Canadian, according to Yemeni and French officials. The crew was made up of six Yemenis, two Moroccans, one Ethiopian, one Filipino and one Indonesian. A number of potential contributing factors were being considered in the crash.  Recent plane crashes » . ""The weather conditions were indeed very troubling and the winds were very strong, reaching 61 kilometers per hour (38 mph),"" Qadir said. ""That's one thing. The other thing was that the sea was very rough when the plane approached landing at Moroni airport."" But French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau noted that France banned the Yemenia Airbus A310-300 several years ago because of safety concerns. ""People are talking about poor weather conditions, but for the moment, we are unsure,"" Bussereau said. ""It seems the plane may have attempted an approach, put on the gas, and attempted another approach, which then failed. For the moment, we must be careful, because none of this information is verified."" Qadir said it was too early to blame the aircraft for the crash. ""This plane is just like any other plane,"" he said. ""It can have a malfunction, but we don't know what really happened before the investigation is over. And then we can determine if there is a technical issue, bad weather or anything else that may have led to the crash."" It is the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month. On June 1, an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. All 228 aboard are presumed dead. The cause remains under investigation.

1880,"(CNN) -- A pair of makeshift bombs blew up Thursday inside a Memphis, Tennessee, high school, sending one person to a hospital and two into police custody, officials said. The ""pressurized"" devices, which incorporated Drano clog remover, were placed in different hallways -- one on the second floor, the other on the third floor -- of Craigmont High School, Memphis Fire Department Lt. Wayne Cook said. ""What it appears is that we had a student or two do a prank,"" said Staci Franklin, a spokeswoman for Memphis schools, describing each device as a ""mailbox bomb."" Police received a call around 11:20 a.m. CT to inform them that someone had called the school warning of a bomb, Memphis police Sgt. Karen Rudolph said. After the bomb threat, school staff heard a loud noise and saw fumes, Rudolph added. An assistant principal sought medical treatment after inhaling smoke from one of the bombs while evacuating students, according to Franklin. The injured person was taken to Methodist North Hospital in Memphis, Cook said. Franklin said the school staff member was believed to be OK. Rudolph said that no other injuries were reported. By that time, two possible suspects had been tracked down and taken into custody, Rudolph said. In addition to firefighters, Memphis police and members of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on site Thursday afternoon, the fire department lieutenant said. Rudolph said members of the police department's bomb unit were inside the school to clear out damage. Craigmont High School is on 50 acres in northeastern Memphis, a few miles from Interstate 40. The school has about 1,300 enrolled students, Cook said.","NEW: 2 possible suspects are in custody, a Memphis police sergeant says .

1881,"(Health.com)  -- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects more than the mind. The disorder may damage blood vessels and increase the risk of dying early, according to new research presented today at an annual meeting of the American Heart Association. The study included about 286,000 mostly male veterans between the ages of 45 and 81 who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and conflicts dating back to the Korean War. The vets with PTSD -- who accounted for roughly 10 percent of the study participants -- had more than double the risk of dying during the 10-year study compared to their peers who didn't have disorder, the researchers found. Health.com: Depression, PTSD common among Iraq vets . Twenty-nine percent of the vets with PTSD died during the study, compared to 8 percent of the vets without PTSD. (The overall death rate in the study was 13 percent.) The increased risk of death associated with PTSD held even after the researchers controlled for factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. A separate analysis involving heart scans from 637 of the veterans found that men and women with PTSD had more calcium buildup in their arteries than vets without post-traumatic stress. Calcium buildup is a hallmark of atherosclerosis (also known as hardening of the arteries), which can lead to heart attacks. Health.com: Surprising heart attack risks . Among veterans with similar degrees of calcium buildup, those who had PTSD were 48 percent more likely to die of any cause during the study and 41 percent more likely to die from heart disease compared to those without PTSD, according to the study, which was led by Naser Ahmadi, MD, a cardiologist at the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center. ""If a vet has PTSD, they need to be under surveillance for cardiovascular disease as they age,"" says Joseph Boscarino, PhD, a senior investigator at Geisinger Center for Health Research, in Danville, Pennsylvania., and an expert on the link between post-traumatic stress and physical illness. Boscarino did not participate in the new study. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that occurs after exposure to a traumatic event, including sexual abuse and military combat. People with the condition experience recurring, intrusive memories about the event, and may also experience emotional numbness and detachment. Health.com: Traumatized? Playing Tetris may reduce flashbacks . Previous studies have linked PTSD to a greater risk of death and heart disease, but the new study is the first to explore what's behind the relationship. The explanation is likely complicated, says Laura Kubzansky, PhD, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, in Boston. Inflammation stemming from constant stress may be involved, she says, but other factors or unhealthy behaviors -- such as not getting enough exercise -- may be partly responsible as well. ""People with PTSD are trying to make themselves feel better in lots of different ways,"" says Kubzansky, who didn't take part in Dr. Ahmadi's study. Behaviors such as smoking ""clearly contribute, but there's something else going on."" It's not clear from the study whether treating PTSD can lower a person's risk of atherosclerosis or heart disease. Still, Dr. Ahmadi says that PTSD should be treated using effective techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, preferably as soon as possible after the traumatic event. ""If you don't treat PTSD, it's like a vicious cycle,"" he says. Health.com: Can Ecstasy help ease post-traumatic stress? Boscarino says that thousands of veterans have contacted him to ask whether they can make disability claims for heart disease and post-traumatic stress to the Veterans Administration. ""The veteran community is very frustrated right now because they can't get a ruling on this [from the VA],"" he says. ""They have to fight each case over and over again, which is not the case for Agent Orange...or other military disability exposures."" Dr. Ahmadi presented his findings at the American Heart Association's annual Scientific Sessions meeting, which highlights the latest heart-related research and treatment advances. Unlike studies published in medical journals, the research presented at the meeting has not been vetted by independent experts in the field.

1882,"Washington (CNN) -- Tests on the ruptured BP well in the Gulf of Mexico will go on for another 24 hours as federal and company officials try to explain ""anomalous"" pressure readings and possible leaks, the federal government's point man on the spill said Monday. ""There is no indication at this time this is any indication of a significant problem in the well bore, but we are running every one of these anomalies down,"" former Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen told reporters Monday afternoon. The pressures recorded on the well in the four days since it was temporarily ""shut in"" are lower than expected, Allen said. Meanwhile, there are possible leaks of methane gas from around the well and from the inoperative blowout preventer, as well as a separate and possibly unrelated seep from the ocean floor about 3 kilometers (about 2 miles) away, he said. Allen said scientists and engineers are still debating whether the low pressure is caused by either the well's depletion after three months of oil spewing into the Gulf or whether oil is leaking from the well into the surrounding sea floor. ""There are arguments to be made on both sides,"" he said. ""But those discussions continue, and we're trying to develop information that will allow us to do that."" He said a joint in the capping stack placed over the damaged well appeared to be leaking a combination of oil and methane, but there appeared to be no sign that it was hindering the equipment now being used to contain the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Some seepage from the ocean floor is normal in the Gulf of Mexico, according to University of Houston professor Don Van Nieuwenhuise. But he said there are weak points in the well bore, and it's ""very hard to tell the difference"" between a depleted well and a leaking well. ""If there is a leak, you should be able to see the oil and gas infiltrating into a rock unit at about that level, and they have not seen that,"" he said. Allen had extended testing Sunday as well, pointing out ""a number of unanswered questions"" about the monitoring systems being used to conduct the tests. Earlier Monday, he said the tests would continue only if BP was ""rigorously"" watching for any signs that the pressure tests could make the situation worse. Engineers and scientists have intensified monitoring of the well, poring over images and data collected by robots, sonar scans, and seismic and acoustic examinations. A government ship is in the area, fitted with equipment for detecting methane gas, which would be an indication of a leak. ""At any moment, we have the ability to return to the safe containment of the oil on the surface until the time the relief well is completed and the well is permanently killed,"" Allen said. In the coming weeks, BP also plans to bring in two more oil collection ships in addition to the two in the Gulf, bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels (about 3.4 million gallons) of oil a day, more than high-end estimates of how much oil had been leaking. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft, Allen's deputy on the scene, said the Helix Producer and the Q4000, two of the ships disconnected from the well to put on the containment cap, could be quickly re-connected within hours if scientists decide that's necessary. In addition, BP also plans to conduct tests known as ranging runs on one of its relief wells, which company officials have said could intersect the ruptured well by the end of July and provide the permanent solution to the leak. BP then plans to pump mud and cement down to kill the ruptured well. Pressure continues to rise steadily at about 1 pound PSI per hour and was about 6,811 pounds Monday evening, BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells told reporters. Wells said gas bubbles reported coming from the well casing could be nitrogen used in the well's cementing process, but others near the well head contained about 15 percent methane. A breach in the casing would be signaled by a drop in pressure or possibly the release of methane gas, which is sometimes a precursor to oil rising through the formation, he said. Continuing with the testing is ""absolutely the best way for us to go forward,"" Wells said. The well, located about 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf and about 40 miles off the mouth of the Mississippi River, erupted April 20 with the sinking of the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon. No oil has gushed out since Thursday, when BP closed all the valves in a new custom-made cap that was lowered into place earlier in the week. That lull in oil flow has jump-started the federal claims process. Kenneth Feinberg, the man in charge of disbursing the $20 billion in funds BP is setting aside to resolve Gulf oil spill-related claims, said Monday that now that the oil leak has apparently been stopped, it will be a lot easier and quicker to get a handle on the universal claims. At a question-and-answer discussion in Washington, Feinberg said it has been difficult to come up with a budget because officials did not know how pervasive the spill would become. ""Now that the oil has stopped, with my fingers crossed, we will quickly come up with an overall budget,"" he said. Feinberg said the fund was being established by BP with the support of the Obama administration as an alternative to years of protracted litigation, and said the challenge is to make the reparations process attractive enough so people will voluntarily seek compensation from it.

1883,"(CNN) -- More than 55,000 cases of dengue, a sometimes deadly mosquito-borne disease, have been reported in a southeastern Brazilian state in the past four months, authorities said Thursday. The disease has killed 67 people this year in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state, the state's ministry of health reported. Slightly less than half of the deaths were children under the age of 13, the ministry said. Brazilian authorities are calling the situation an epidemic. The ministry of health did not identify whether the deaths were attributed to the more severe form of dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever, which ""can be fatal if unrecognized and not properly treated,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The CDC said that with treatment, fatalities due to dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is characterized by abnormal internal or external bleeding, can be less than 1 percent. Dengue fever, the more common form of dengue, is caused by four closely related viruses. All of them are carried by infected mosquitoes, mainly the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the CDC said.  Watch a report on the outbreak » . It cannot be spread from person to person. The Rio de Janeiro health ministry said 513 of its 57,010 cases of dengue were that of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Rio de Janeiro Mayor Cesar Maia said that patients from outside the city are flooding the municipal hospital and that there aren't enough beds to accommodate them, Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported. The newspaper said the average hospital waits ranged from eight to 28 hours in some places. One father told O Globo, ""I am just watching my son die slowly as we knock on different hospital doors."" The state's secretary of health, Sergio Luiz Cortes da Silveira, acknowledged, ""We don't have enough hospitals for these patients."" He said the state was appealing for help from pediatricians elsewhere in the country.  Watch ill Brazilians being cared for » . Earlier this week, the country's health minister, Jose Gomes Temporao, said that 2,000 people, including members of the Ministry of Health and the military, were working to combat the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the government reported on its Web site. At least part of this work, he said, included going door-to-door to inform people of where the mosquitos live. ""Without the mosquito, dengue does not exist,"" he said, according to the government. The CDC estimates that there are 10 million cases of dengue around the world each year. ""It actually is quite common,"" said Dr. Ali Khan of the CDC.  Watch Khan discuss dengue and its prevention » . Mosquitoes carrying dengue viruses breed in stored, exposed water, including places as shallow as jars, discarded bottles and plant saucers, according to the World Health Organization. Khan emphasized prevention. ""Wear long sleeves, loose, baggy pants and make sure you're using good insect repellent."" Symptoms of dengue fever include high fever, severe headache, backache, joint pains and eye pain, nausea, vomiting and a rash, according to the CDC. There is no vaccine to prevent dengue fever or dengue hemorrhagic fever, the CDC said. E-mail to a friend .","Authorities: More than 55,000 cases of dengue reported this year in Brazil .

1884,"(Health.com) -- People who carry the genital herpes virus but have no visible symptoms -- and may not even be aware they're infected -- are still capable of spreading the virus about 10% of the time, according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. An estimated 16% of U.S. adults are infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), which can cause bumps, blisters, or sores on the genitals and surrounding areas, along with pain and itching. But only about 10% to 25% of these people know they carry the virus. While some infected people have frequent outbreaks, most never have symptoms and others have just one or two flare-ups. Previous research has shown that people infected with HSV-2 can pass the virus to someone else through genital contact even if they don't have symptoms. The new study -- the largest of its kind to date -- helps quantify that risk, says Christine Johnston, M.D., one of the study's authors and an acting assistant professor of medicine at the University of Washington, in Seattle. ""A lot of times people are diagnosed with HSV-2 by an antibody test and they don't know what to do with that information,"" Johnston says. ""Now I think we have a number that we can tell people."" Health.com: Top 10 myths about safe sex and sexual health . The study included 498 adults with healthy immune systems who had a diagnosis of genital herpes or who tested positive for HSV-2. Every day for at least 30 days, the participants inspected themselves for symptoms and collected a swab of genital secretions, which were stored and later tested in a lab. The 410 people with a history of herpes symptoms were found to be actively ""shedding"" the virus on 20% of the days for which they collected swabs, compared with 10% of days for those who had never experienced symptoms. The symptom-free people released the same amount of virus when they were shedding as the symptomatic people did when they weren't experiencing an outbreak. (The amount of virus increased if symptoms were present.) The 10% figure is an average, Johnston notes; some people will shed the virus more frequently, while others will shed it less often. ""People will interpret the risk very differently,"" she adds. ""Some people will feel like 10% is a lot and some people will feel like 10% is a little."" Health.com: 28 days to a healthier relationship . ""[The study] just begs the point that safe sex is important, and you had better know who your partner is,"" says Richard D. Whitley, M.D., a past president of the Infectious Disease Society of America and a professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Whitley is a leading expert on herpes but was not involved in the current study. Everyone should know whether they have HSV-2, Whitley says. Aside from the risk of unwittingly infecting sexual partners, pregnant women with no symptoms can pass on the virus to their babies with devastating consequences for the newborn, including death. (The risk of transmission is as high as 30% to 50% if the mother is infected during her third trimester.) In addition, HSV-2 infection can cause complications in people who have weakened immune systems due to chronic disease, and it can increase a person's likelihood of contracting HIV, Whitley says. Health.com: What to do if your partner refuses to wear a condom . People with HSV-2 can protect their partners from contracting the virus by using male or female condoms during sex, and by taking virus-suppressing drugs. Each measure reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to a sex partner by about half. Some people with herpes take antiviral drugs for years, while others just use them periodically -- for example, when they're starting a new relationship or anticipating a high-pressure situation. (Stress can up the risk of a herpes outbreak.) ""It really is a very personal decision for patients,"" Johnston says.

1885,"New York (CNN) -- A ""pocket dial"" mistake can result in an unwanted phone call, annoying for the recipient and potentially embarrassing to the caller. But a new study found a staggering number of those apparently accidental calls in New York City are made to emergency responders, jamming up 911 lines in a city that has prided itself on its ability to respond in a crisis. Nearly 4 million of those calls were made to the city's emergency call centers in 2010, according to a recent Winbourne Consulting report, commissioned by the city after a massive blizzard delayed first responders and left Mayor Michael Bloomberg open to criticism. That's more than one-third of some 11 million emergency calls made in New York each year, the study found, which was released Friday. Those calls were 19 seconds or less. Authorities determined that they were likely accidental and say unnecessary communications add an increased burden on emergency response systems. ""The increased proliferation of cellular telephones has caused a dramatic increase in the number of accidental 911 calls made,"" the report said. In 2011, the Federal Communications Commission issued a report estimating that 70% of all 911 calls -- intentional or mistaken -- were made from wireless devices. The consulting firm recommended implementing a citywide information campaign to alert the public of the issue and to streamline systems between the police and fire departments, among other recommendations.","Nearly 4 million apparently accidental calls were made to emergency call centers in 2010 .

1886,"West Pokot, Kenya (CNN) -- More than 13 years after his parents drowned in a flash flood, David Kakuko is at the Moruny River, building a bridge that might have prevented their deaths. The hanging footbridge will provide safe passage over the Moruny, a frequently flooded waterway in West Pokot, Kenya. ""Before the bridge, there [were] so many people, so many who lost their lives,"" said Kakuko, 32. ""I know, because I have no parents. I have no parents, because this river took them."" Kakuko is working alongside other local residents and Harmon Parker, a master mason who has been building bridges through Kenya's mountainous terrain since 1997. Parker, a Lexington, Kentucky, native who came to Kenya in 1989, has seen firsthand how flash floods -- and the threat of predators such as crocodiles and hippos -- can make rivers impassable in isolated communities. ""I've worked all over Kenya,"" said Parker, 54. ""And every community [has] a story of ... loved ones lost."" When Parker arrived in Kenya as a young missionary, he befriended Jay Hindson, a fellow development worker who introduced him to a bridge build in 1996. The experience changed the course of his life. ""It was a plea from the community,"" Parker recalled. ""I saw that building a bridge could change lives and transform communities."" Parker has been building bridges ever since, and in 2003 he founded the nonprofit organization Bridging the Gap. The organization oversees the building of bridges that not only save lives but connect isolated villagers to resources that can improve their way of life. ""When it floods, people really suffer not being able to get to the clinic or the market or to their school,"" Parker said. ""Like every people, they have dreams. They want to prosper."" Since 1997, Parker has helped build 45 bridges in Kenya. He estimates they've affected tens of thousands of lives, but he insists his work is not about the numbers. ""I have built many bridges in very remote areas for the 'few and the needy' that a larger organization may not consider,"" he said. ""Knowing this bridge will probably save at least one life is what makes me tick. ... I build bridges because I want to save lives, lives that I will never know about."" Parker's hanging footbridges are simple in design, with an average length of 120 feet and an average cost of about $6,000. They are built using basic materials and local tools so villagers can maintain them and make repairs when needed. There is high demand for Parker's help. But because of limited financing, he is able to organize only five or six projects a year. To determine which projects he takes on, Parker visits the village that initiated the request. To qualify for a bridge, the river in question must be considered a peril to cross. It also has to inhibit access to education, health care or commerce. Parker also requires that the community demonstrate a willingness and ability to participate in the construction of the bridge, whether it's by gathering sand, making gravel or digging foundations. It's ""so they can take pride in their bridge, so that they feel they played a big role in it and that they have ownership,"" Parker said. Kakuko has no problem with making that commitment. ""It is good for us, because this is our bridge,"" he said. ""It is not for the men who gave it to us. It is ours. So people should guard and watch over it like it is their own."" Although the bridges are sponsored by donors, villagers are also expected to provide some form of financial contribution. ""I don't know how many goats I have in this region. But they always give me a goat,"" Parker said. ""I was even offered a young wife in a real rural area. And I had to refuse that."" Parker's work requires that he spend weeks, even months at a time away from his wife and home in Nairobi. And over the past 15 years, he's been robbed at gunpoint, plagued by parasites and afflicted with grave illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever. But he doesn't see his role as sacrificial. ""I feel I'm blessed ... privileged to do what I'm doing,"" he said. ""A bridge is a beautiful metaphor for many things. There are bridges of hope, bridges of peace, bridges of life. To me, bridges are beautiful."" Want to get involved?

1887,"(CNN) -- A small passenger plane crashed Monday into a hill outside the capital of Honduras, killing all 14 people aboard, officials said. ""The impact of the plane was pretty strong, it would have been very difficult for a person to have survived, given the way the fuselage looked,"" said Oscar Triminio, a spokesman for the fire department. The twin-engine Let L-410 aircraft had taken off from the northwest city of San Pedro Sula carrying 12 passengers and two pilots and was en route to Toncontin International Airport in the capital city of Tegucigalpa, the Honduran Civil Aviation Department said. The airline, operated by Central American Airways, is not affiliated with a U.S. airline with the same name. At about 8 a.m., once it had been cleared to land, the plane began descending toward the airport but lost communication with the control tower, the department said. Rescuers were then alerted. The crash site was just south of Tegucigalpa at the top of a hill some 2,000 feet (600 meters) above sea level, near the town of Santa Ana Francisco Morazan, Triminio said. The weather was cold and foggy, as it had been since the weekend, he said. One of the pilots had initially survived the crash, but died on the way to the hospital, he said. The first people to arrive at the crash site were residents of the nearby village who found one of the pilots still alive. ""It's sad to hear a person in the rubble asking, 'Help! Help! Help!' "" said Jorge Sandrez, mayor of Santa Ana. Emergency personnel were searching for the data recorders to help in the investigation. The bodies of the 11 men and three women were taken to a morgue in Tegucigalpa for identification by relatives. Civil aviation authorities identified three passengers as Americans. They gave CNN a list of those on the flight. Also among the victims were Rodolfo Rovelo, who other news organizations have identified as assistant secretary for public works; Jose Israel Salinas, who has been identified as a trade union leader; and Carlos Chain, a former finance minister.

1888,"Chardon, Ohio (CNN) -- A funeral service is planned Saturday for 16-year-old Daniel Parmertor, one of three students killed in an Ohio high school shooting. The shooting occurred Monday in the Chardon High School's cafeteria where authorities say T.J. Lane opened fire at the students. Two other students were hospitalized and another was grazed by gunfire. The shooting rocked the school and the community of 5,100 people about 30 miles east of Cleveland. Students returned to school Friday as they tried to return to resume their daily routines. Grief counselors and police were on hand, and the principal led a moment of silence. ""Everyone is here for each other,"" Senior Garrett Szalay said. ""But a lot of us are moving on."" Authorities say T.J. Lane, 17, is responsible and charged him with three counts of aggravated murder, two of attempted aggravated murder and one of felonious assault. The latter is related to the student who was ""nicked in the ear"" by a bullet, according to Geauga County Prosecuting Attorney David Joyce. Friday marked the first full school day since the incident, a return that administrators and staff touted as key to helping people through the healing process. Staff spent two days working on the transition and expressed confidence that they'll be ready to provide comfort and support to those still trying to make sense of this week's carnage, School superintendent Joseph Bergant said. Frank Hall, an assistant football coach and study hall teacher who chased the gunman from the school, said Thursday it was important that students and staff return -- if for no other reason than to ""show that terror and evil do not win out."" ""I'm here to tell you that tomorrow our schools will be open, our teachers will be there, our administration will be there, our parents and community, but more important our children will be there,"" Hall said. Meanwhile, the legal process continues. Joyce, the prosecuting attorney, filed charges against Lane on Thursday in juvenile court. The defendant's next court appearance will be Tuesday and a hearing scheduled for March 19 will discuss a motion to transfer his case to an adult court. The murder charges state that the teenager ""purposely and with prior calculation and design"" fatally shot three people while at Chardon High. The prosecutor has said that the sophomore confessed that he took a .22-caliber gun and a knife into the school Monday morning and fired 10 rounds as frightened students and some teachers ran for cover. By the time the bloodshed ended, three were killed: Parmertor, who died Monday; Demetrius Hewlin, 16, who died Tuesday morning; and Russell King Jr., 17, who was declared brain dead Tuesday. Lane's friends have said that the teen had a troubled childhood. His parents had both been charged with domestic violence against each other, according to court documents. His father also served prison time for assaulting a police officer and was charged with holding a different woman under running water and bashing her head into a wall. ""I think there's a lot of kids that go through things like that. That doesn't give them the right to kill other people,"" said Bob Parmertor, Daniel Parmertor's grandfather. "" No one has the right to shoot other people because they've had a rough life.""

1889,"New York (CNN) -- Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration faced its first public oversight hearing Monday as a part of a probe into what went wrong during last month's blizzard, with administration officials saying they should have declared a snow emergency. City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn called the response ""unacceptable,"" as New Yorkers braced for another winter storm that forecasters say could dump six to 12 inches of snow beginning Tuesday night. She said the holiday blizzard ""brought New York to its knees in a way we have never seen before,"" asking administrators why a state of emergency was never called. Deputy Mayor of Operations Stephen Goldsmith said the decision not to call an emergency was based on its requirement to remove unchained cars from roadways, which could have created confusion among the thousands of drivers who would have been forced to look for parking. It was a move, he said, that later proved to be the wrong decision. Goldsmith -- who is responsible for city agencies that include police, fire and sanitation -- identified several issues that led to the slow response. He said New York had insufficient accountability tools, which led to a lack of information on street conditions, and delayed using city snow removal equipment. The city also failed to get and use private resources fast enough, didn't communicate enough with the public and had problems with emergency communications, he said. Goldsmith also added that only half the city's sanitation trucks were equipped with radios, making it hard for them to respond to changing weather conditions as snow began falling at up to 2 inches per hour. Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty called it the ""most difficult storm"" he had ever faced, blaming the coincidence of the holiday travel season that brought higher numbers of weekend travelers. But Councilman Peter Vallone said the administration failed in the planning stages, including carrying out adequate pre-salting of roadways, plus what he called its failure to communicate the seriousness of the blizzard to the public. Bloomberg came under intense criticism after telling New Yorkers to go to a Broadway show, seemingly downplaying the gravity of the crisis, during the height of clean-up operations. He later reorganized the Sanitation Department and rolled out a series of measures and pilot programs meant to improve city response during future storms. Goldsmith said the administration planned to outfit every sanitation truck with global positioning systems and other monitoring measures, including ""scout teams,"" meant to send up-to-date information back to City Hall. However, Vallone said equipment problems ""may explain missing a few blocks,"" but does not explain ""missing a few boroughs."" As the city grappled with one of the largest storms in its history, some neighborhoods in the city's outer boroughs remained snowbound for days. The snow hampered morning commuters, delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours, officials said. Thousand of emergency calls to 911 dispatchers remained backlogged, prompting the mayor to urge residents not to dial 911 unless it was a life-threatening emergency. Hundreds of city buses and ambulances remained stuck, prompting officials to ask the states of New York and New Jersey for ambulance loans to help reduce the backlog of emergency services requests. In one instance, a newborn died in Brooklyn after the mother waited nine hours for emergency responders, according to New York Fire Department spokesman Steve Rittea. ""Why did we not err on the side of caution (in declaring a state of emergency) when lives were at stake?"" asked Sanitation Committee Chairwoman Letitia James during Monday's hearing. Goldsmith said the city needed a broader range of options in an emergency declaration, including one that would not require car removal. Sanitation union representatives, who have defended workers against accusations of an intentional slowdown amid rumors of a supervisor retaliation for budget cuts and demotions, did not speak during Monday's hearing. Department of Investigations Commissioner Rose Gill Hearn said she is conducting an independent review into the allegations. But the rumors that appeared to reflect an inner-city squabble have also raised deeper questions into how state deficits could affect public-sector services, and vice versa. During last month's blizzard, an army of private contractors joined thousands of public sector employees in New York, working overtime to salt, plow and shovel the city's five boroughs. New York hired 86 private firms to bolster snow removal efforts, Doherty said, at a price tag that remains unclear. The snow also strained budgets across the region, forcing neighboring state administrators to face the added costs of more winter weather. In the week that left many New Yorkers stranded, Mayor Bloomberg called snow removal a top priority while also reminding residents of a state deficit ""that's going to filter down to us."" New York state's $9 billion budget gap for fiscal 2012 is inherited by newly appointed Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But it could be just the beginning. The state's budget gap looms in the $14 billion range for fiscal 2013, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. And New York is not alone. Neighboring New Jersey has similar problems, with projected budget gaps of $10.5 billion for the next fiscal year, according to the Conference of State Legislatures. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's budget presentation is due February 22. Cuomo's is due on February 1. And with another winter storm expected Tuesday, state and municipal governments are again expected to reach into the public coffers.","NEW: NYC hired 86 private firms to bolster snow removal at a price that remains unclear .

1890,"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Hurricane Ike grew from a Category 1 into a menacing Category 4 storm in about six hours Wednesday as it fed on the warm waters of Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center said. An infrared image from a NOAA satellite shows Ike swirling in the Atlantic on Wednesday night. ""Ike is an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane"" with 135-mph  sustained winds, the center said in its 11 p.m. ET advisory. Although it is likely to lose some strength during the next few days, Ike is forecast to regain Category 4 status by Monday, the center said. ""It is too early to determine what, if any, land areas might be affected by Ike,"" the hurricane center said. But the center's potential four- to five-day track for Ike puts it anywhere from north of Jamaica to the coast of South Florida on Monday. iReport.com: Are you in Ike's path? At 11 p.m. ET Monday, Ike was moving west-northwest through the Atlantic Ocean. The storm will be over open water for two days, forecasters said. Earlier Wednesday, Ike intensified into the fifth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic season when its winds reached 80 mph. But before Ike can reach into the Caribbean or threaten Florida, Tropical Storm Hanna was getting more organized in the Bahamas, according to the hurricane center. At 2 a.m., Hanna was about 325 miles east-southeast of Nassau in the Bahamas, with winds of 65 mph. Hanna was drenching the Bahamas and Haiti with torrential rains. Haitian officials put the nation's death toll in the wake of Hanna and Hurricane Gustav at 61, said Abel Nabaire, the deputy coordinator of the civil protection service. Eight of the country's 10 departments underwater, he said. More rainfall, up to 15 inches in some places, was possible in the Caribbean, the hurricane center said. Hanna was forecast to return to hurricane strength by Friday as it shot up the east coast of the southern U.S., with landfall predicted on the South Carolina or North Carolina coast late Friday or early Saturday. ""A hurricane watch may be required for a portion of the southeastern United States coast early Thursday and interests in this area should monitor the progress of Hanna,"" the hurricane center said. Florida could begin seeing rainfall from Hanna on Friday, forecasters said.   Watch as Florida also keeps an eye on Hanna » . Swells from Hanna are expected to bolster the number of rip tides along the southeastern U.S. coast this week, the hurricane center said. iReport.com: Hanna makes waves in Bahamas . Hanna passed over the northern Haitian city of Gonaives on Tuesday night, leaving water more than 12 feet deep in some places, an official said.  See Hanna's impact on Haiti » . Many people were still cut off amid floodwater. ""It's a very grim picture,"" Dr. Jean Pierre Guiteau of the Red Cross said Wednesday. ""We can't reach those people; they are standing on rooftops, waiting for help."" In line behind Ike in the Atlantic is Tropical Storm Josephine, with top winds near 50 mph, the hurricane center said. Josephine was about 425 miles west of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands off western Africa.","NEW: Ike goes from 80-mph winds to 135-mph winds in six hours .

1891,"(CNN) -- Two feet of snow has fallen in western New York and more is coming along the southern shore of Lake Erie from Cleveland, Ohio, to Buffalo, the National Weather Service said Monday. The heavy snow spread north of Buffalo as well. ""Yesterday morning we had none. So it's quite a transition to go from no snow to all this. When you open the door, it's amazing,"" librarian  Dorothy Valenti told The Associated Press by telephone from Constableville, New York, not far from the east end of Lake Ontario. ""It's strange to have a snow day before Thanksgiving."" The latest lake-effect storm dropped 23 inches on Ellicottville, New York, 40 miles south of Buffalo, as of 10:15 a.m. Monday and 20 inches on nearby South Dayton. ""It's not nice,"" emergency dispatcher Laurie Moore in New York's Cattaraugus County told The AP. ""Lots of snow. Roads are snow-covered and slippery."" An additional 6 inches of snow could come by evening, according to CNN affiliate WGRZ-TV in Buffalo. The National Weather Service posted lake-effect snow warnings from Buffalo to Cleveland, Ohio, through Tuesday afternoon.  Watch how heavy snow wreaks havoc in Ohio » . Lake-effect snow occurs when cold air passes over a warmer body of water, in this case Lake Erie, according to the weather service. The cold air sucks up the moisture and heat from the water, dropping it as snow when it moves over land. Wind and snow showers with temperatures in the 20s are forecast for the NFL ""Monday Night Football"" game between the Buffalo Bills and the Cleveland Browns, WGRZ reported. To the south along Interstate 90, shoppers in Erie, Pennsylvania, were preparing for the worst on Sunday. iReport.com: Thunder, lightning accompany snowstorm . ""I just went and bought new wipers ... I'm scared!"" Angela Gadzek, of Warren, Ohio, told CNN affiliate WJET-TV. The area could expect as much as a foot of snow before Tuesday, WJET reported. ""Just pray everybody stays safe on the roads, just slow down and use your head,"" Mark Alexander, of Albion, Pennsylvania, told WJET. ""We're ready, we got steady snow tires on everything, and everything's secure at home,"" Alexander told WJET. In Ohio, state transportation officials were concerned about keeping the roadways safe. Rock salt to clear roads of ice was in short supply, CNN affiliate WKYC-TV reported, and authorities were looking for ways to stretch supplies to counteract escalating prices. The Ohio Department of Transportation used sensors in the roads to target the worst spots and help plow drivers determine how much salt to use, WKYC reported. They were also wetting the salt before spreading it to prevent it from bouncing off highways, WKYC said. Three to five inches of snow are expected in northeastern Ohio, for a total accumulation of up to 10 inches, WKYC said. Authorities advised motorists to put off non-essential travel until the snow threat eased. Copyright 2008 CNN.

1892,"Miami (CNN) -- Officials in a popular stretch of coastal North Carolina ordered all visitors to evacuate ahead of Hurricane Irene, which damaged homes in the Bahamas Wednesday as it churned toward the U.S. East Coast. Irene, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, could jump to Category 4 strength by Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said. Federal emergency management officials had a simple message for those in or near the path: Be prepared. Dare County, North Carolina -- home to Manteo, Nags Head, Duck and Kitty Hawk -- was taking no chances. A mandatory evacuation for tourists was to take effect 8 a.m. ET Thursday. Residents could stay for now, but they were advised to ready themselves for Irene. The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse closed Wednesday evening. Other venues, including the Wright Brothers National Memorial visitors center, also were shuttered. ""They are taking precautions,"" Sydney Jenkins, bar manager at Poor Richard's Sandwich Shop in Manteo, said Wednesday evening. ""It's now more or less whether it's even going to hit us."" ""This is a huge storm,"" said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. ""The cloud field is more than 800 miles across. The tropical storm force winds extend out 200 miles from the center."" The strengthening came as the storm pounded central and southeastern Bahamas. Rainfall of 6 to 12 inches was expected in the Bahamas, with 15 inches possible in some places, the Miami-based Hurricane Center said. At 11 p.m. ET Wednesday, Irene was moving northwest at 12 mph and was between Rum Cay and Long Island, 150 miles east-southeast of Nassau. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 70 miles and U.S. weather officials predicted significant storm surge. ""We are urging persons in central Bahamas to exercise extreme caution,"" said Capt. Stephen Russell, head of the National Emergency Management Agency in the island chain. No injuries had been reported as of Wednesday evening, but extensive structural damage from wind was reported on Acklins and Crooked islands, Russell told CNN. Numerous homes had been blown off their foundations. Russell had no information on rainfall amounts. Electricity was out in some locations. Irene whipped through the island of Mayaguana, the mostly easterly island in the chain, and moved into Long, San Salvador and Cat islands, which are not heavily populated. About 65% of the country's population is on New Providence, home to Nassau. Projections showed the island being outside of hurricane-force winds, Russell said. ""We hope the system makes a gradual turn to the northeast."" After it makes the turn, Irene could threaten large sections of the Eastern Seaboard, from the Carolinas into the Northeast. But, forecasters said, it was too soon to predict how it would affect the United States because of the ""cone of uncertainty."" Even if Irene doesn't touch land or glances off the U.S. coast, ""the waves are going to be tremendous,"" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. Swells generated by Irene will begin affecting the Southeast's coast Thursday. ""On the forecast track, the core of Irene will move across the southeastern and central Bahamas through tonight and over the northwestern Bahamas on Thursday,"" the Hurricane Center said. Irene forced more than a dozen cruise ships to change their itineraries in the Caribbean, CruiseCritic.com reported. Those ships include the Carnival Sensation, which had been docked in Freeport, Bahamas, but was coming back to Port Canaveral, Florida, late Wednesday. Irene has prompted the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism & Aviation to recommend strongly that people with plans to travel to the Bahamas in the next few days postpone their trips. The storm will curve northward as it nears the United States, with most of the latest projections suggesting the storm will avoid landfall until it is north of North Carolina. The storm is expected to arrive off North Carolina by Saturday morning. The storm approaches as Americans increasingly are relying on social media to prepare for and keep abreast of disasters. According to two American Red Cross surveys, the increased use of social media and mobile technology has caused response agencies ""to engage with people in times of disaster and to include information from social networks in their response efforts."" North Carolina coastal areas could see about 6 inches of rain and tropical storm force winds.  Irene is forecast to be a Category 2 or 3 storm when it reaches the U.S. East Coast later Friday or early Saturday. Many counties were taking a wait-and-see attitude on evacuations. Warren Lee, emergency management director in New Hanover County, North Carolina, said shelters likely will be opened. ""If the storm stays on current track, we don't expect a major impact and we will not issue an evacuation order plan right now."" Some computer models suggest New York or New Jersey could be hit. ""Everywhere from North Carolina to Massachusetts remains in the cone of uncertainty,"" Jeras said. ""Worst-case scenario, we could be looking at two landfalls, or we could be lucky and get a brush instead of a direct hit. ... Even if Irene doesn't make landfall in the United States, it may very well bring flooding rains, damaging winds and power outages to the Northeast. Planning is critical, and everyone needs to be ready with a disaster plan and a safety kit."" Chris Martin, an employee at Endeavor Seafood in Newport, Rhode Island, said a bridal shower is scheduled Sunday in Portsmouth for his fiancee. ""We're hoping to have it outside."" Martin is hoping the hurricane, if it actually affects the state, will not arrive until Monday. Hyde County, in North Carolina's Outer Banks, declared a state of emergency for Ocracoke Island and the county's mainland, along with a mandatory evacuation for all visitors and a voluntary evacuation for residents. The mandatory evacuation will extend to residents beginning 5 a.m. Thursday, Hyde County Emergency Services said. Ocracoke is reachable only by boat or private plane. While forecasts showed the storm ""moving further from the coast and toward the sea,"" North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue said Wednesday, ""we must all prepare for the worst."" In Kill Devil Hills in the Outer Banks, locals who insist on staying through the storm were planning ""hurricane parties"" as they stocked up on water, canned food and flashlight batteries, said CNN iReporter Penelope Penn, who was in the area Tuesday. ""The water was so calm and the sky so clear at the Outer Banks last night. It truly is calmest before a storm,"" Penn added.  On Wednesday, Penn was in nearby Virginia Beach, Virginia. The last major hurricane to strike the United States was Wilma in 2005, which was a Category 3 at landfall, Jeras said. Hurricane Katrina, earlier the same year, was also a Category 3 at landfall. The most recent hurricane to make landfall in the United States was Ike in 2008, which hit near Galveston, Texas, as a Category 2. Gloria in 1985 was the most recent hurricane to hit New York. It was a Category 3 at landfall, the National Hurricane Center said. In 1991, Hurricane Bob hit Massachusetts, a Category 2 at landfall. Bill Read, director of the Hurricane Center, said Irene could cause problems with flooding in Northeastern states that have already had lots of rainfall this summer. Widespread damage is possible from the coastal Carolinas all the way up to the Canadian Maritimes, including the major cities of the Northeast, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. Irene is expected to pass well east of Florida, so only minimal effects are expected Thursday and Friday as the storm moves northward toward the Carolinas. But the U.S. Coast Guard is worried boaters in south Florida are taking the threat too lightly. Officials expect heavy rip currents and beach erosion in Miami. ""The most prudent thing to make sure mariners are not out this time tomorrow,"" Capt. Chris Scraba said. South Carolina state officials decided not to order evacuations. Boaters and swimmers were urged by the Coast Guard to stay out of the water. CNN's Ed Payne, Chandler Friedman, Joe Sutton, John Fricke, A. Pawlowski and Nelson Quinones contributed to this report.","Extensive damage reported on two Bahamas islands .

1893,"(CNN)  -- The Army Corps of Engineers' failure to properly maintain a shipping channel linking New Orleans, Louisiana, to the Gulf of Mexico led to catastrophic flooding during Hurricane Katrina, a federal court ruled Wednesday. ""It is the court's opinion that the negligence of the Corps, in this instance by failing to maintain the MRGO properly, was not policy, but insouciance, myopia and short-sightedness,"" U.S. District Court Judge Stanwood Duval Jr. wrote in his lengthy ruling, referring to the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet canal. ""For over 40 years, the Corps was aware that the Reach II levee protecting Chalmette and the Lower Ninth Ward was going to be compromised by the continued deterioration of the MRGO ... The Corps had an opportunity to take a myriad of actions to alleviate this deterioration or rehabilitate this deterioration and failed to do so. Clearly, the expression 'talk is cheap' applies here."" Duval's ruling was issued in a lawsuit brought by six plaintiffs affected by the 2005 hurricane, who claimed the Corps of Engineers was liable for damages. The judge ruled against one couple, who lived in New Orleans East, but awarded the others, from the Lower 9th Ward and St. Bernard Parish, damages ranging from $100,000 to $317,000. ""The people of this city are vindicated,"" said Joe Bruno, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys. ""They didn't do anything wrong. It's now time for them to be compensated."" The ruling applies not only to the six plaintiffs, attorney Pierce O'Donnell said, but to 100,000 homes and businesses in the parish and the Lower 9th Ward. Under the precedent set by Duval's decision, they too will be entitled to compensation. ""The judge's ruling today validates the feelings and beliefs that many citizens have held for four years,"" said New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin in a statement. ""Although the ruling is liberating for thousands impacted by the devastation and tragedy of Hurricane Katrina, it is my hope that justice will prevail to help families make their lives whole again."" Once a Category 5 storm, Katrina had weakened to a Category 3 storm with 127 mph winds when it made landfall on the morning of August 29, 2005, between Grand Isle, Louisiana, and the mouth of Mississippi River. A few hours later, the storm again crossed over land on the other side of the river, its winds only slightly diminished. More than 1,800 people died in the storm, most -- nearly 1,600 -- in Louisiana, where Katrina devastated New Orleans when the city's levee system failed and widespread flooding occurred. Overall, the storm damage covered more than 90,000 square miles and displaced nearly 300,000 people, causing more than $81 billion in damage. FEMA called Katrina ""the single most catastrophic natural disaster in U.S. history."" While courts have declared the Corps was liable for Katrina flooding, judges until now have issued it a ""get out of jail free"" card, the plaintiffs' attorneys said. ""It has been proven in a court of law that the drowning of New Orleans was not a natural disaster, but a preventable man-made travesty,"" the attorneys said in a statement. ""The government has always had a moral obligation to rebuild New Orleans. This decision makes that obligation a matter of legal responsibility."" Duval ruled that because the Corps failed to maintain the shipping channel, erosion widened it, and its banks -- which helped protect the levees -- deteriorated, leaving the levees unprotected, undermined and more vulnerable to waves coming off Lake Borgne. The Corps also failed to take other actions, such as armoring the banks with rocks, the attorneys said. ""This court cannot but comment that the Corps' approach reminds the court of the old adage, 'Close your eyes and you become invisible,' "" said the ruling. ""It is beyond arbitrary and capricious -- it flies in the face of the purpose of NEPA [the National Environmental Policy Act] and ignores the very heart of what 'operation' means,"" Duval wrote. The plaintiffs claimed the Corps was not entitled to immunity because its activities regarding the shipping channel ""were in direct contravention of professional engineering and safety standards,"" Duval wrote. ""... Ignoring safety and poor engineering are not policy, and clearly the Corps engaged in such activities."" ""This is not the Corps that built the Panama Canal,"" said Joe Bruno, another plaintiffs' attorney. ""This is a different Corps. This is a Corps that's reckless."" The attorneys said they plan to go to Washington after Thanksgiving to meet with the Justice Department. Although the Corps was given immunity from liability in areas like Central New Orleans and New Orleans East, they said they would like to start a settlement process for all citizens. ""We want to leave no residents behind,"" O'Donnell said. ""We'd like to have a regional settlement.""

1894,"(CNN) -- A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Monday off the third-largest island in the Philippines, prompting the country to issue a tsunami alert for the coastlines near the epicenter. The quake struck about 11:49 a.m. (10:49 p.m. Sunday ET) about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from the coastal city of Dumaguete on the Philippine island of Negros, the USGS said. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology issued a Level 2 tsunami alert for areas along the Tanon Strait between Negros and the neighboring island of Cebu. That's a notch below the highest tsunami alert of Level 3, which requires evacuation of the affected areas, a spokeswoman for the institute said. She said the institute was advising people to watch out for unusual waves and to stay away from the shoreline. The alert was issued at 12:31 p.m. (11:31 p.m. Sunday ET), the spokeswoman said. No tsunami warning has been issued for the wider Pacific region and there is no tsunami threat to Hawaii, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. The earthquake occurred in the ocean at a depth of 46.6 kilometers (29 miles), according to the USGS. There were no initial reports of widespread damage. At the Circle Inn Hotel in the city of Bacolod, which is on Negros but not on the coast nearest the quake's epicenter, a receptionist said the quake lasted between three and five minutes. ""We felt the shaking,"" the receptionist said. ""The guests all exited the building. But all the people here are okay."" There was no damage to the hotel, the receptionist said.","NEW: The Philippines issues a tsunami alert for the coastlines near the quake .

1895,"(CNN) -- Sanaa residents reported hearing heavy explosions and sporadic gunfire for several hours early Tuesday, one day after security forces set fire to tents and tore through demonstrators' camps in Freedom Square in Taiz with bulldozers, an activist and eyewitnesses said. It was not immediately clear what caused the blast sounds in Sanaa, which residents described as coming from the Hasabah neighborhood, an area close to it and the region near the airport. Hasabah is home to Sheikh Sadeq al-Ahmar, leader of the powerful al-Hashid tribe, whose forces oppose the government. Eyewitnesses in the capital city said they saw a heavy security presence in Sanaa, as well as what they described as ""armed thugs"" roaming the streets. In Taiz, a center of protests against the Yemeni president, the protest camp was essentially gone on Monday, said Bushra Maktati, a leading human rights activist. A field hospital was also dismantled, with the equipment taken away by troops, Maktati said. Troops also used water cannons to disperse thousands of protesters in the city on Monday, a day after clashes left at least 20 people dead and 200 wounded, according to eyewitnesses and two medical officials who could not be named because of security concerns. One youth activist said the attacks would not stop their protests. ""Our revolution will not stop even if hundreds are killed every day,"" said Sameer Al-Samaee, a leading youth activist in Taiz. ""Killing innocent civilians always leads to war crime charges and that is what we are seeking for Saleh."" Meanwhile, government forces launched airstrikes against Islamic militants in the coastal city of Zinjibar, where fierce fighting raged Sunday. And the nation's largest cell phone network was ordered shut down Sunday, according to a senior official with the country's Communications Ministry who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The SABAFON network was ordered shut down because of violations and unpaid fines over the last few years, the Communications Ministry official told CNN. A management official with the SABAFON network, who also was not authorized to speak to the press, confirmed the shutdown. The official denied the government's allegations and said the move appeared to be a tactic to pressure members of the al-Ahmar family, including Hamid al-Ahmar -- President Ali Abdullah Saleh's chief political enemy. The official said members of the al-Ahmar family are majority shareholders in SABAFON, with the largest shareholder being Hamid al-Ahmar. Saleh has been under intense pressure to resign after months of protests and mounting opposition. Taiz, where protests continued Monday, has been a center of anti-Saleh activity. The most recent protests broke out Sunday when thousands of protesters took to the streets and were met with gunfire from security forces. Protesters threw rocks at the forces, who responded with more gunfire, witnesses said. The U.S. Embassy in Sanaa condemned what it called the ""unprovoked and unjustified attack"" on demonstrators in Taiz. It praised the protesters and called on Saleh ""to move immediately on his commitment to transfer power."" On Monday, security forces were arresting youths and taking them from the streets to an unknown location, Maktati, the human rights activist, said. At least 70 tents had been burned down by security forces since late Sunday night, according to witnesses. Abdu Ganadi, a government spokesman, said security forces were rescuing colleagues who had been captured and beaten by protesters. ""We did not attack the protesters,"" Ganadi said. ""Reports are all exaggerated. Only two were killed."" He said protesters' tents were burned by people attacked by the protesters, and that tents that burned were empty. In Zinjibar, fighting continued Monday between Yemeni troops and Islamic militants. Militants moved into the city on Friday and controlled the streets by Saturday, residents said. The militants began ferocious attacks on Saturday, according to a Yemeni government official who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Security forces and soldiers abandoned their posts, leading to chaos, the source said. Hundreds of soldiers moved back into the city on Sunday, with heavy fighting between militants and the Army's 25th Mechanized Brigade, the source said. More than two dozen soldiers had been killed since the start of the battle on Saturday, said a government source Sunday who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The fighting occurred on the same day Saleh met with top military and security officials to talk about ""hostilities and crimes"" occurring in his country, the Yemeni State News Agency reported. Saleh has been resisting protests calling on him to step down after 33 years in power. The powerful al-Hashid tribe, which includes the al-Ahmar family, rose up against long-time leader Saleh in the last week, after he backed out of a regionally brokered deal meant to ease him out of office and end months of demonstrations of the kind that have swept the Arab world this year. The recent fighting has raised fears of a full-blown civil war in Yemen, an impoverished, arid and mountainous nation that has been a key U.S. ally in the battle against the al Qaeda terrorist network.","Witnesses say security forces use bulldozers and fire to dismantle camps in Taiz .

1896,"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Air Force has grounded its entire F-22 Raptor fleet amidst continuing concern over how the fighter jet provides oxygen to the pilot, according Capt. Jennifer Faerrau, a spokesperson for the Air Force's Air Combat Command. The stand-down order was made Tuesday but is just now becoming public. It's unclear how long the stand down will last. There are about 165 Raptors in the fleet. Since January, the aircraft already had been kept at altitudes under 25,000 feet during an ongoing investigation into a November crash. Flying above that altitude could cause a pilot to black out from lack of oxygen and lose control. The stand-down affects all routine training and other missions, Faerrau said. The Air Force is looking at all the systems on this new-generation fighter jet, but one area of focus is the On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS), according to Ferrau. The order came from Gen. William Fraser, commander of Air Combat Command, which is based at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.","The stand-down order was made Tuesday but is just now becoming public .

1897,"(CNN) -- Tourists visiting an Egyptian resort have been warned to be alert after a series of shark attacks that have left one woman dead and several people seriously injured. The German woman died Sunday after being attacked by a shark in waters off Sharm el-Sheikh, prompting Egypt's tourism ministry to close the beach until the animal responsible is found. Thousands of tourists flock to Sharm el-Sheikh each year, attracted by its warm climate and clear waters, but the UK Foreign Office on Monday amended its travel advice for people visiting the area. A statement on its website read: ""Attacks by oceanic white tip sharks are extremely rare and shark attacks of any kind are very unusual in the Red Sea. ""If you are considering diving or snorkelling in any of the Red Sea resorts be aware that safety standards of diving operators can vary considerably. ""A basic rule is never to dive or snorkel unaccompanied. Where possible make any bookings through your tour representative. ""Unusually cheap operators may not provide adequate safety and insurance standards."" Tour operators Thomson and First Choice also warned holiday-makers about the shark attacks. ""We are treating the situation very seriously and are advising all of our customers not to swim in the sea at Sharm el-Sheikh,"" a statement said. ""We have also cancelled all water-based excursions until further notice."" After the attacks authorities ordered people to stay out of the water around Sharm el-Sheikh. On Thursday, the Environment Ministry said two sharks suspected of the maulings were caught. Jochen Van Lysebettens, general operations manager of the Red Sea Diving College in Sharm el-Sheikh, said employees at the Hyatt Regency resort told him the attack happened about noon (5 a.m. ET) in a protected swim area off the resort. Van Lysebettens has three dive-instruction operations in the area, including one at the Hyatt Regency. The 70-year-old woman, a regular guest at the resort, was snorkeling near a reef when she was attacked, he said. She called for help, and a lifeguard brought her to shore, but she had lost too much blood and resuscitation efforts failed, Van Lysebettens said. The woman's arm and leg were severed, he said. A British tourist described witnessing one of the shark attacks. Ellen Barnes, 31, of Horsham, West Sussex, told The Sun newspaper: ""The water was churning like I was in a washing machine. I was being thrown around in the blood."" After the Sunday incident, the Chamber of Diving and Watersports called on its members in the region ""to stop any snorkeling activities happening from any boats or shore."" The chamber is under the umbrella of the Egyptian Tourist Federation. Van Lysebettens said all tourists were ordered to stay out of the water at least through Monday. The dive community is organizing volunteer expeditions to find the shark, he said, and about 40 people will search Monday. On Friday, two sharks were caught and killed near the South Sinai National Park on the Sharm el-Sheikh coast, according to the Chamber of Diving and Watersports. The chamber said that as of Friday, the condition of three injured snorkelers -- two Russian women and a man from the Ukraine -- were unchanged. One of them was critical, the chamber said in a statement, but did not say which one. The three were attacked in a 24-hour period November 30 and December 1, the chamber said. Van Lysebettens said he is not a marine biologist, but many have speculated an oceanic white-tipped shark was responsible for the German woman's death, as well as the other attacks. Divers are upset because the two sharks killed Friday are thought to be innocent. They were a mako shark and another oceanic white-tipped shark -- which did not match pictures taken by someone accompanying one of the injured snorkelers, he said. Officials at the national park did not provide details on ""why the animals could not be relocated to remote waters as was previously suggested,"" the chamber's statement said, adding it ""does not wish to see any harm to any further sharks."" Exploratory dives were taking place on Friday, Van Lysebettens said. Officials are not sure what triggered the feeding behavior, described as highly unusual. ""This incident has clearly shocked our community, and the CDWS is continuing its investigation into why this may have happened,"" Hesham Gabr, head of the Chamber of Diving and Watersports, said in the statement. ""It is clear from our initial discussions with shark behavioral experts that this highly unusual spate of attacks by an oceanic white tip shark was triggered by an activity, most probably illegal fishing or feeding in the area."" Several divers in the area saw carcasses of dead sheep in the water last week, Van Lysebettens said. It's not known how they got there, he said, but they could have washed out to sea or fallen off a boat. The shark may have been attracted by the carcass, he said, and could now be attacking slow-moving things on the water's surface. CNN's Brian Walker and Karen Smith contributed to this report.","Tourists visiting Egyptian resort warned to be alert after shark attacks .

1898,"(CNN) -- A tropical depression formed in the western Caribbean Sea on Sunday, and is likely to become Tropical Storm Rina as it skirts the Honduran coastline, the National Hurricane Center said. The depression -- the 18th of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season -- was located off the Nicaragua/Honduras border late Sunday afternoon, forecasters said. The government of Honduras issued a tropical storm watch from Punta Castilla eastward to the Nicaraguan border. A tropical storm watch means tropical storm conditions, including sustained winds of at least 39 mph, are possible within 48 hours. The depression was moving northwest at near 12 mph, and was expected to turn west-northwest Monday. ""On the forecast track, the center of the depression is expected to pass north of the northeastern coast of Honduras during the next couple of days,"" the center said. The depression's maximum sustained winds were at 35 mph, just shy of tropical storm strength, forecasters said. ""Gradual strengthening is expected during the next day or two and the depression is forecast to become a tropical storm tonight or Monday,"" the center said. The depression is expected to dump 2 to 4 inches of rain over eastern Honduras, with isolated maximum amounts of 7 inches possible in some spots, according to the center. The forecast track shows the system brushing Belize as a tropical storm and making landfall near Chetumal, Mexico, on Friday. However, such long-range forecasts are subject to change.","The tropical depression is the 18th of the hurricane season .

1899,"Paris (CNN) -- An investigation into the mysterious 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 into the southern Atlantic Ocean will also include a probe into Air France-KLM, the airline's attorney said Friday. A French magistrate already is investigating Airbus for involuntary manslaughter in connection with the crash, according to the airline manufacturer and a court spokeswoman. However, Fernand Garnault, the attorney for Air France-KLM, said he doesn't know why the airline is part of the investigation. He said the magistrate is looking into a problem involving pitot tubes, which measure a plane's air speed. Still, ""there is nothing new in this case and there is no proof that the pitot tubes caused the crash,"" Garnault told CNN. Judge Sylvie Zimmerman is presiding over the inquiry into the Airbus-made plane, court spokeswoman Sylvie Polack told CNN on Thursday. The plane fell into the sea while traveling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people aboard. Thomas Enders, CEO of Airbus, disagreed with the decision to commence the investigation. ""On behalf of Airbus, I have noted the absence of facts supporting this step and stated our strong disagreement,"" Enders said in a written statement. ""Airbus maintains that the focus should be on finding the cause of this accident and making sure it can never happen again. Airbus will continue to support the investigation, including the continued search for the flight recorders, which is the only sure way to know the truth,"" he said. Investigators have not yet established what caused the crash, and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found, despite an extensive search operation that included a French navy submarine. The plane went down in stormy weather, and most of the bodies were never recovered. Studies of the debris and bodies that were found led France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the BEA revealed in a 2009 report. Automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed, the investigators said, though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster. The area where the plane went down is far out in the Atlantic -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in West Africa. The rough underwater terrain includes mountains and valleys, the BEA said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed from Los Angeles.","NEW: Air France-KLM also being investigated .

1900,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A series of explosions in western Pakistan killed four people Sunday, including a young boy, authorities said. Fourteen others were wounded. A blast in Pakistan's volatile Balochistan province left three members of the country's security forces dead, and two more wounded, military and police officials said. The victims were part of a convoy escorting civilians through the Zain Koh area of Dera Bugti, said Ghulam Muhammad Baloch, a police official. Nine people were wounded when militants lobbed a hand grenade at a shop in the provincial capital of Quetta, speeding away from the blast. No deaths were reported in the attack, but one person was in critical condition, said Nazir Kurd, another police official. The attacks came just two days after an explosion outside the home of a former lawmaker in Quetta killed 13 people. Also Sunday, a 7-year-old boy died in a roadside bombing in Pakistan's tribal Bajaur agency, said Islam Zeb, a government official. Three others were wounded in that attack. Journalists Wajahat S.

1901,"(CNN) -- A white tiger mauled a zookeeper to death at a New Zealand wildlife park Wednesday as a group of tourists watched in horror, police say. The zookeeper at Zion Wildlife Gardens in New Zealand could not be saved by other staff. The attack took place at the Zion Wildlife Gardens near Whangarei, about three hours north of Auckland. Two zookeepers had gone in to clean an enclosure at the park, when one of two white tigers inside lunged at a keeper, said Sarah Kennett, spokeswoman for Northland Police. The second keeper and other zoo staff tried to pull the tiger off the man but failed. He died shortly after, Kennett said. The tiger was put down, the park said.  Watch park officials, visitors react » . A group of eight tourists who were on a guided tour of the park witnessed the Wednesday morning attack, Kennett said. ""This is an incredibly sad day,"" the park said in a statement, adding that it would provide counseling to its employees. The Zion Wildlife Gardens is home to several endangered tigers and lions.

In February, an employee needed surgery after he was attacked by a white tiger, according to local media reports. Last year, the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry released documents to CNN affiliate TVNZ that said animals at the park were kept in crowded, unsanitary conditions. Inspectors were so concerned about the conditions that they considered having 40 cats put down, the documents said.","White tiger mauls a zookeeper to death at a New Zealand wildlife park .

1902,"(CNN) -- The deaths of three men who residents say were mowed down by a car while protecting businesses from looters have heightened fears in Britain's second largest city. Jittery residents said they peer over their shoulders as they scuttle down the streets. Businesses that remained opened all night close at the first sign of darkness. And the distraught father of one of the victims, who tried desperately to revive his dying son, appealed for calm. ""Blacks, Asians, whites. We all live in the same community. Why do we have to kill one another?"" said Tarik Jahan. ""What started these riots, and what's escalated them? Why are we doing this?"" Jahan's son, Haroon, was killed early Wednesday in Birmingham, along with two brothers, Shazad and Munir Hussein -- both in their 30s. The 21-year-old was struck by a car while he kept watch outside a gas station following a break-in, according to the father. ""I heard the thud and ran around and I saw three people on the ground. My instinct was to help the three people. I didn't know who they were; who'd been injured,"" he said. ""I helped the first man and somebody from behind told me my son was lying behind me. So I started CPR on my own son."" He struggled to revive his son, his face and hands covered in blood. ""Why? Why? The guy who killed him drove directly into the crowd and killed three innocent guys,"" he said. ""Why? What was the point of doing that? I don't understand."" British police have not tied the deaths to the riots, but residents say the victims were among a group that lined up outside storefronts to stop rioters from breaking into properties. ""I remember passing by there a few hours before it happened, and there were lots of Asian kids, calmly watching guard outside shops, not disturbing anyone,"" said Esther Kiilu, a resident of neighboring Rowley Ridges. ""They looked like they were sons of the owners and their friends."" Kiilu said a few hours after she got home, she saw television reports of the deaths along the street she uses daily. Residents held a vigil Wednesday night outside the gas station where the three were killed. ""It was a huge group of people, just quietly holding candles,"" Kiilu said. The victim's father, who addressed reporters hours after his son was killed, urged rioters to end the violence. ""Step forward if you want to lose your sons,"" he said. "" Otherwise, calm down and go home. Please!"" As soon as he finished addressing the crowd, two sides started arguing, prompting police to step in and separate the groups. ""You guys have got nothing better to do, go home, men,"" the father told the two bickering sides. A man has been arrested in connection with the deaths, which police are treating as a murder inquiry. Birmingham, like many other areas in Britain, was roiled by riots that began Saturday, spurred by the shooting death of a man who protesters said was killed by police. ""I just want things to return to normal, this has just got out of hand,"" said Hilda Siviter, who lives in Bewdley, a small town near Birmingham. ""All this trouble is being caused by a huge group of lazy guys who can't be bothered to go out and get a job, and they suddenly see free things and decide to take advantage,"" Siviter said Thursday. Lawmakers are concerned that rioters could use the opportunity to stir up tensions. ""What we don't want is for other elements to now hijack what's happened and make this something else and make this more serious,"" said Shabana Mahmood, the member of parliament for Birmingham. In addition to the three deaths in Birmingham, police on Wednesday identified a man fatally shot in a vehicle in south London as Trevor Ellis. Ellis died Tuesday, a day after he was shot in the head in Croydon, police said, without linking his death to the riots. Initial inquiries indicate he had traveled with friends to the area, where a dispute ensued with a group of nine people. The dispute led to a pursuit involving three vehicles, after which Ellis was shot, police said, appealing to witnesses to come forward. Analysts say a mix of economic and social tensions has been at play in the unrest, with deprivation a key factor. The rioters and looters have been from diverse ethnic backgrounds and span a wide range of ages.

1904,"(CNN) -- Eddie Canales' nonprofit, Gridiron Heroes, provides emotional and financial support to high school football players who've sustained life-changing spinal cord injuries. Canales' son Chris was paralyzed during a high school football game in 2001. But it was a year later when the two came up with the idea to help other kids and their families. Eddie and Chris were watching a high school football game from the stands when they saw another player suffer a spinal cord injury. They reached out to the injured player and his family, and within months, Gridiron Heroes was born. CNN asked Canales for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. CNN: Where you were when you got the call that you'd been selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Eddie Canales: I was sitting at the dining room table, going over information about an event we hosted the weekend before. I was so excited! I was listening to the other details, thinking to myself, ""This is what Gridiron Heroes needs: creating awareness on a big picture."" CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to Gridiron Heroes? Canales: What a difference it could have to be able to help so many more high school football players all across the nation. ... I was just pumping my fist, saying to myself: ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" What a blessing. I had goose bumps going down my arms. I looked up and gave thanks to the Lord above. My eyes started to water, because I know my dad is looking down. And I said, ""Dad, you were right!"" One of the last things my dad did was to bring me grant-writing information, telling me that I might need some of this information because Gridiron Heroes was going to be big and this would go nationwide. He went into the hospital that same day and passed a week later. I know he is smiling down on me. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Canales: One of my goals has always been to create an educational fund for these guys, because some of them are getting of that age now where they want to go to school. The state requires you take a full (class schedule) to get funding; a lot of them can't do that. (We want to) get them back three semester hours, six semester hours -- whatever they think they can handle --and let them go back to school. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Canales: Gridiron Heroes is not about deterring anyone from playing football. The game and the injury is the bond all these young athletes have. (But) these kids need help, and the families need help. More attention should be given to what happens to the athlete after an injury has taken place. More attention should be given to the huge disparity in the level of support provided by the football community for those injured on a high school level compared to a collegiate or professional level. I am hoping that the football community can come together to make sure these young athletes are never forgotten. Read the full story on CNN Hero Eddie Canales: .

1905,"(CNN) -- One of the men controversially pardoned earlier this year by Mississippi's outgoing governor could land back behind bars after being charged with driving drunk and causing an accident that killed an 18-year-old woman. A Pontotoc County, Mississippi, grand jury has charged Harry Bostick with drunken driving leading to a death, felony drunken driving and fleeing the scene of an accident where a death occurred, according to the indictment filed on Thursday and obtained Monday by CNN. The accident happened in October. If convicted, Bostick could be sentenced to at least 30 years in prison. His attorney did not respond immediately to a call on Monday for comment. After the charges were handed up, Bostick turned himself in and a judge set bail at $50,000, Paul Howell from the Pontotoc County prosecuting attorney's office said. The 56-year-old posted bond on Friday and was released, according to official online records. This isn't Bostick's first-run in with the law in Mississippi. He was convicted of felony drunken driving in March 2009, soon after having been convicted in July 2008 and November 2008 for drunken driving. The former Internal Revenue Service investigator was one of nearly 200 convicted criminals, including four murderers, whom Gov. Haley Barbour pardoned shortly before leaving office earlier this year. The pardons elicited an uproar, with Attorney General Jim Hood leading a charge to overturn them. But after legal challenges, they were upheld. Bostick was still going through a court-mandated drug rehab program when he applied for his pardon last summer. On September 30, the Mississippi Parole Board sent its review of Bostick's application to Barbour, recommending a full pardon in a 3-2 vote. A week later, on October 7, Bostick was driving under the influence again, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol. Charity Smith attempted to pull out onto a highway just outside Tupelo when Bostick's truck slammed into the side of her car, the patrol says. Smith was killed, and her older sister suffered serious injuries. Bostick was jailed for violating his probation from his previous DUI cases. In the grand jury indictment, Bostick is accused of ""willfully, unlawfully and feloniously"" driving while intoxicated; refusing to immediately stop or give his name, address or registration; and having ""negligently"" caused Smith's death. When he received the pardon in January, the convicted DUI felon still sat in an Oxford, Mississippi, jail cell, awaiting formal charges for the arrest tied to that case. Barbour had said that he wasn't aware of Bostick's October 2011 DUI arrest when he chose to pardon him. But e-mails obtained by CNN show that the governor's office did, in fact, know about it. Amanda Jones, the governor's chief counsel, and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann were told about the October car crash that killed Smith just days after it happened. Jones and Hosemann were even urged by a lawyer in the firm that represented Bostick not to issue the pardon, according to the e-mails. ""They knew it, and they didn't stop it,"" Smith's mother Linda Smith told CNN last month, after becoming overcome with emotion when she saw the e-mails. ""Why didn't they do something?"" It is not known whether anyone communicated this information to Barbour. His spokeswoman would not comment on the e-mails, citing an ongoing case on executive pardon power that is before the state Supreme Court. The full pardon granted by the governor, for the March 2009 conviction, gave Bostick back the rights that were taken away as a felon, such as voting. But his two other DUI convictions remain on his record, according to the state attorney's office in Lafayette County. That means that Bostick will avoid the possibility of a stiffer sentence if he's convicted on the charges tied to Smith's death, because it will be treated as his third DUI offense instead of his fourth. However, he could be back to where he was before the pardon: as a convicted felon, thus losing the rights that were restored to him. Asked Monday night about the new charges, Linda Smith said she doesn't want Bostick to get any more second chances. ""I hope no one gives him any more pardons,"" Charity's mother said. ""I pray for justice."" CNN's Rich Phillips and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: The mother of a crash victim says, ""I hope no one gives him any more pardons""

1906,"(CNN) -- A former top Colombian official survived an assassination attempt Tuesday after a daylight bombing in the country's capital, authorities said. Fernando Londono, a former interior and justice minister, was among at least 39 people injured in the Bogota blast. He was being treated at a hospital, President Juan Manuel Santos said. ""I want to condemn this in the strongest terms,"" he said, adding that the motive for the attack was unknown. Londono's driver and his head of security were killed, Santos said. A chaotic scene unfolded as the blast hit a commercial neighborhood in a city where such attacks have become rare. All the windows on a bus were blown out, and blood was all over the area, witness German Diaz said. People panicked, he said. Some cried. Video showed shattered glass and scattered car parts covering the street as rescuers arrived. Security cameras at the Bogota intersection recorded a man crossing the street while cars were stopped at a red light, CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported. The man threw a package at the vehicle Londono was riding in, then sped away on a waiting motorcycle, the CNN affiliate said. Colombian authorities were offering a 500 million peso ($280,000) reward for information leading to the capture of those responsible for the attack, Santos said. Earlier Tuesday, police detected and deactivated a car bomb in central Bogota. Santos told reporters Tuesday evening that there was no evidence linking the two incidents. Mayor Gustavo Petro suggested the attack could have something to do with the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect on Tuesday. ""We think it is a plan aimed at trying to destabilize the city on the precise day when the free trade agreement begins,"" he told reporters. He urged the city's residents to remain calm and report anything suspicious to authorities. Londono served as minister of interior and justice from 2002 to 2004 during the administration of President Alvaro Uribe. He was known for being outspoken against leftist rebel groups, including the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Londono travels with a sizable security detail because of numerous threats against him. Rebels say they'll free French journalist . Even as Santos said authorities were still trying to determine who was behind the blast, one police official blamed the rebel group. ""Nobody else could have done it, and we have reasons to say what we are saying,"" Bogota Police Chief Luis Eduardo Martinez told reporters, according to Caracol. Analysts offered a similar assessment. ""It has all the hallmarks of a FARC operation,"" said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. The bombing comes as recent Colombian government operations and policies have caused significant setbacks for the rebel group, she said. ""This kind of attack in Bogota has become extremely rare, but nonetheless seems designed to drive home a political point, that the guerrillas retain this capacity for violence,"" Arnson said. Several bomb blasts occur every year in Bogota, but assassination attempts are uncommon, said Ben West, senior tactical analyst for Stratfor. The last one occurred in 2007, when a letter bomb was sent to the deputy education minister, he said. In the 1980s and 1990s, high-profile attacks targeting government officials were more common in Colombia, he said. ""I'd say for about the past 10 years, it's been much more quiet,"" West said. ""One attack doesn't make a trend. It could just be an outlier, but it is significant that it was an assassination attempt, not just a random bombing. ... It is a more sophisticated attack."" Local media reports have speculated that the attack could be connected with the trade agreement, he said, and some have suggested local criminal gangs could be behind it. But the FARC seems to have the strongest motive and capabilities to mount such an attack, West said. The rebels could be responding to a new government approach that expands the focus of military operations beyond the group's leaders, he said. ""They're going after all the FARC members. They're trying to be more disruptive rather than surgical. If they're successful in this, it's going to get a response from the FARC,"" West said. ""An attack like this, in Bogota, in the capital of the country, where the government is, it could be a response to the new strategy the government is taking."" Journalist Fernando Ramos contributed to this report from Bogota. Mariano Castillo and Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.","Officials don't know who was behind the blast, President Juan Manuel Santos says .

1907,"(CNN) -- U.N. observers who were stranded overnight in a Syrian town after their convoy struck an explosive device have made it safely to the city of Hama, the United Nations said Wednesday. The six observers were in Khan Sheikhoun, part of Idlib province, when they were attacked, said Ahmad Fawzi, spokesman for U.N.-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan. No U.N. personnel were injured in the explosion Tuesday, but three vehicles were damaged, Fawzi said. A bombardment by Syrian forces continues in Khan Sheikhoun, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The regime is using ""all kinds of heavy weapons, the LCC said. Opposition activists reported another day of widespread violence in many parts of the country that left at least 15 people dead. Nine people died Wednesday in Khan Sheikhoun, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A child and a civilian were among them. Four died of wounds suffered Tuesday as government forces attacked the area, the group said. Three people, including a young girl, were killed Wednesday when government forces shelled a camp for displaced residents, opposition activists said. The camp in Daraa is for displaced Syrians from the Golan Heights, who were not fleeing violence from the current unrest in Syria, according to the observatory. Syria, on state-run news agency SANA, said 11 ""army, law enforcement and civilian martyrs"" were buried Wednesday. Also, 250 citizens ""who were involved in the recent events and whose hands are clear of the Syrian blood were released on Wednesday,"" SANA said. Syria blames the violence in the country on ""armed terrorist groups."" SANA also reported that three terrorists -- one from Libya and two from Tunisia -- ""confessed that they infiltrated into Syria through the Turkish borders in order to carry out terrorist attacks in coordination with al Qaeda and militias of the so-called free army."" The rebel Free Syrian Army has been battling regime forces. Opposition groups say President Bashar al-Assad's government has been trying to mar their efforts with false accusations of links to terrorism. Syria has met their call for a new government and political reforms with a brutal, violent crackdown, opposition activists say. The LCC on Wednesday reported raids, the burning of homes, random arrests and more throughout the country. Ambulances were prevented from aiding the wounded in some places, the group said. The Tuesday attack on the U.N. convoy took place around the same time government forces fired on a nearby funeral procession, according to opposition activists. At least 23 people were killed and 100 were injured in that attack, said the opposition group Avaaz. The LCC described dozens of people falling to the ground after government forces fired on them using heavy machine guns. Videos posted on YouTube purported to show what happened. CNN cannot confirm their authenticity. The United Nations estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the 14-month crisis, while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000. CNN cannot independently verify reports of deaths and violence because the Syrian government has severely restricted access by international media. Meanwhile, a Western diplomat confirmed to CNN that according to a confidential U.N. draft report, Iran is violating a Security Council ban on weapons exports and that Syria is the top recipient for those arms. The report, which was drafted by a panel of experts and submitted to the Security Council's sanctions committee on Iran, describes three large seizures of Iranian weapons shipments within the year. The diplomat confirmed that report claims two of those seizures involved the Syrian Arab Republic. CNN's Samira Said, Amir Ahmed and Joe Vaccarello contributed to this report.","Syria says three ""terrorists"" confessed .

1908,"(CNN) -- It's a South Korean car crash that has been viewed online 2 million times over the past week and has sparked a government-led investigation. A couple in their 60s were driving to a department store in Daegu, 238 kilometers (148 miles) south of Seoul, when their car suddenly accelerated. Their son, who wants to be identified only by his surname, Kwon, posted the video from May 6 onto an Internet forum, he says to prove his father was not at fault. Kwon told CNN, ""My father said he heard an odd noise from the car. He thought there was something wrong, then felt the vehicle suddenly accelerating. He twisted the car wheel to the left as he was trying to avoid the cars in front of him, and that is when the vehicle accelerated at a crazy speed. He continued to avoid traffic and people but in the end, there was nowhere else to dodge, and he crashed into a car."" The footage from a camera attached to the rearview mirror -- a common practice in South Korea -- shows that the car also drove through two red lights before it crashed into the stationary car at a speed believed to be 80 mph (129 kph). You can hear the couple saying, ""Oh my God, what is happening, what is wrong?"" The wife screams ""Oh no"" just before impact. Kwon says his mother, 63, had an operation for internal bleeding and is awaiting a second operation on her back. His father, 65, suffered a fractured finger and fractured ribs. The Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs says it is investigating the claim of sudden unintended acceleration. Sohn Young-sam, an official at the ministry, told CNN that 80 claims of such acceleration have been investigated since 2003. Hyundai declined a CNN interview request but sent a statement saying, ""The vehicle is being investigated by the Korean National Forensic Service. There is no time estimate for the conclusion of the investigation."" CNN's K.J. Kwon contributed to this report.","A car suddenly accelerated as a couple drove to a store .

1909,"(CNN) -- Two U.S. Navy ships collided Wednesday off the coast of San Diego, according to Navy officials. No injuries have been reported and the cause of the accident is still under investigation, but it appears to be a steering malfunction, Navy spokesman Cmdr. Charlie Brown said. Both ships -- the USS Essex, an amphibious assault ship, and the USNS Yukon, a refueling ship -- were damaged, but the full extent was not immediately known, Brown said. According to a U.S. Navy statement, the accident occurred about 9:20 a.m. PT about 120 miles off the coast of Southern California. The ships were approaching each other as the Yukon was preparing to refuel the Essex, the Navy said. The steering malfunction was aboard the Essex, the Navy said. The Essex is scheduled to return to San Diego May 17 after completing 12 years as the Navy's only permanently forward-deployed amphibious assault ship in Sasebo, Japan.","No injuries reported as two Navy ships collide about 120 miles off the California coast .

1910,"(CNN) -- Three shipwrecked fishermen lived on clams and seaweed for 10 days while stranded on an island off Canada's Pacific Coast until a passing sailboat rescued them, the Royal Canadian Navy said Friday. On Friday, the Canadian Coast Guard ship Tanu rendezvoused with the sailboat and was transporting the three fishermen northbound back to Prince Rupert, according to the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Victoria. The three fishermen were scheduled to arrive Friday night, and no injuries have been reported, authorities said. The three men were on a fishing trip on their 50-foot liner Pacific Siren when it capsized about 70 miles south of Prince Rupert, the navy said. The three men boarded a life raft and paddled eight miles to Banks Island, located off central British Columbia in the Hecate Strait, a fishing ground for salmon and halibut, the navy said. While on the island, they used their raft as a shelter, the navy said. Mackenzie Moseley, maritime coordinator for Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Victoria, described Banks Island as ""real remote piece of coast with no real population."" ""So, to see three guys on beach is really odd in itself,"" Moseley told CNN. A passing sailor in his 70s in his boat, the Macona, was believed to be on a pleasure outing when he saw the stranded three fishermen, Moseley said. The sailor radioed the Prince Rupert Coast Guard and then he anchored and launched a dinghy to approach the island shore, Moseley said. The sailor gave the three men food and water and then called the coast guard again, Moseley said. The coast guard's Tanu was on patrol an hour away when the call came in, Moseley said. Said Moseley: ""Real kudos to the sailing vessel Macona for keeping a sharp lookout and saw what was going on and did a good job."" The three fishermen's vessel didn't have an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, which transmits a distress signal anywhere in the world through a satellite system, the navy said. Canadian authorities were to assess the three fishermen's health once they boarded the coast guard ship.","Three fishermen's boat capsizes; they paddle raft eight miles to island .

1912,"(CNN) -- The shadow of the moon swept across the globe from Hong Kong to the Texas Panhandle as a rare annular solar eclipse began Monday morning in Asia and traversed the Pacific. The sun appeared as a thin ring behind the moon to people in a narrow path along the center of the track, which began in southern China. Heavy clouds obscured the view in Hong Kong, but residents of Tokyo and other cities were able to get a spectacular view for about four minutes around 7:32 a.m. Monday (6:32 p.m. ET Sunday). Events were held at schools and museums in Japan, while many more people took in the unusual astronomical event at home or on street corners. After whizzing across the Pacific, the shadow emerged over northern California and southern Oregon, where thousands of people attended parties to watch the event, the first to appear in the United States since 1994. Experts warned that hopeful viewers should not peer up at the sky without special viewing equipment, since looking at the sun with the naked eye can cause blindness. Derek Ralston, a professional photographer, said he used a welding filter to capture a direct view of eclipse in the foothills above Oroville, California. He shared the photo on CNN iReport. Noting ""the rather slim swath of the globe who could see the impact of the eclipse,"" Ralston said he wanted to enable ""the rest of the world to see how clear it looked to those of us who were fortunate enough to see it."" The sliver of sunshine then traveled southeast across central Nevada, southern Utah and northern Arizona, and then New Mexico. It passed over Albuquerque, New Mexico, about 7:34 p.m. (9:34 p.m. ET) before petering out east of Lubbock, Texas, according to NASA. An annular eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and sun at the farthest point of its orbit, meaning it will block less than the entire sun. That leaves a large, bright ring around it as it passes. Patrick Wiggins, a NASA ambassador in Salt Lake City, said he always looked forward to seeing people's reactions to such events. ""You get everything from stoic, staring into the sky ... to people breaking down and crying, they're just so moved,"" he said. Aaron Lin, an 8th-grade student from Moraga, California, said a tree in his family's yard had served as unexpected natural viewing device on Sunday. The leaves of the tree, whose shadow falls on the side of the family's house, broke up the light from the eclipse into scores of tiny crescents on the wall, he said. ""I was so shocked by these shadows because it looked like a painting or computer art,"" said Aaron, 13. Did you view the eclipse? Share your photos with CNN iReport and they could be featured on CNN. The next solar eclipse will be on November 13, and is expected to be visible over northern Australia, according to NASA. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki, Tyson Wheatley and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Northern California gets a clear view of the ring of fire .

1913,"(CNN) -- A speedboat carrying Britain's Prince Harry broke down in the Bahamas, but that didn't slow the royal down during his Caribbean tour. Prince Harry boarded a media boat after a mechanical failure stopped the Royal Bahamas Defence Force boat he was riding to Harbour Island on Sunday. Throngs of cheering crowds met him on the island, which the 27-year-old son of Prince Charles and Diana visited as part of a tour celebrating the 60th anniversary of his grandmother's accession to the throne. Island resident India Hicks, a bridesmaid in his parents' wedding, helped show him around the normally sleepy enclave. Prince Harry's Diamond Jubilee celebrations began Friday in the Belize capital Belmopan, where the prince danced and drank in a street party along the newly named HM Queen Elizabeth II Boulevard. The prince had a quieter day in Belize Saturday, climbing to the top of Xunantunich, a Mayan temple. He toured an open-air exhibit in Nassau's Rawson Square before boarding the speedboat Sunday. After a youth rally in the Bahamas National Stadium on Monday, Prince Harry was scheduled to travel to Jamaica and then on to Brazil to complete his 10-day tour. Diamond Jubilee celebrations marking six decades on the throne for Queen Elizabeth II officially began last month and continue through June, when London will mark the anniversary of her coronation with festivities including up to 1,000 boats sailing up the River Thames. The 85-year-old monarch has no political power, but she has immense power as a figurehead. She is officially the head of state of 16 countries that used to be part of the British Empire, including the Bahamas.

1914,"(CNN) -- A member of the Dutch royal family was severely injured in an avalanche at an Austrian ski resort Friday, local authorities told CNN. Prince Johan Friso, 43, a son of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, was skiing outside the bounds of the ski resort with friends at the resort of Lech am Arlberg when he was hit by an avalanche, a spokesman for the state of Vorarlberg said. No one else in the group was affected, the spokesman said. The prince was under the snow for a ""short period of time,"" the spokesman said. He was wearing an electronic beacon that helped rescuers quickly find him, he said. The prince was airlifted to a hospital in Innsbruck, where he is in intensive care, authorities said. Doctors described the prince as stable but not out of danger, according to a statement from the queen. Lech am Arlberg is in Austria's Vorarlberg state, a popular skiing area in western Austria. The region's avalanche agency reported there was a considerable to great chance of avalanches in Lech on Friday. It cited new snowfall on top of a packed layer of snow that could cause snow slabs to slide off. The prince gave up his right to the throne when he married in 2004 without Parliament's permission. He and his wife live in London with their two daughters. CNN's Francesca Church contributed to this report.","Doctors say he is stable but not out of danger .

1915,"(CNN) -- When the roaring stopped, when the debris stopped whirling and the glass stopped breaking, the 4-foot wooden cross remained on the wall. It was a fixture in the emergency department waiting room of St. John's Mercy Hospital in Joplin, Missouri, a symbol of the hospital's Catholic roots and, perhaps, a comfort to the sick and injured who sought help there. And after St. John's took a direct hit from a catastrophic tornado May 22, it became a symbol of something else: Joplin's resilience, the strength and compassion of its people and their determination to rebuild. On Sunday, the cross will be loaded onto a truck bed and will lead the way from the old hospital to the site of a new facility during a dual demolition-groundbreaking ceremony. Demolition of the old hospital building -- a reminder of the tragedy -- will begin, and ground will be broken for a new building as Joplin moves forward. ""It's hard to say goodbye to the building that has been St. John's since 1968,"" said Gary Pulsipher, president of St. John's Mercy, in a statement. The hospital has occupied three different sites in Joplin since 1896. ""But like the rest of the city, we are glad to be moving ahead and looking to the future. While we will never forget what happened here, taking down the hospital is another step in the process of removing the visible signs of the tornado's devastation from the landscape,"" Pulsipher said. ""As I drive by it, like everyone else, it reminds me of that horrible night that lives were changed in our community,"" said Gary Shaw, a Joplin city councilman. But, he said, the building is also ""a testimony"" to the past eight months ""and how strong people have been, and how they've pulled together."" ""A lot of cleanup has been done, a lot of rebuilding is going on,"" Shaw said. But ""people are still somewhat confused, and they're going through, I think, a time of 'This happened. What do I do now?' I think that's kind of where we are now. We're trying to get over the shock of all of it."" The final death toll from the tornado was 161 -- including five patients and one visitor at St. John's. More than 1,000 people were injured. The Joplin twister was the deadliest on U.S. soil since the National Weather Service began keeping records in 1950. It was classified as an EF-5, the highest ranking on the scale used to measure tornado intensity, with winds of more than 200 mph. Inside St. John's, on the corner of 26th and McClelland Boulevard in the southwestern part of the city, patients were watching television, resting, eating dinner or receiving visitors that Sunday evening when the twister slammed into the nine-story building about 5:40 p.m. Windows were blown out. Cars were hurled in the parking lot like toys, piled near the emergency room entrance. Gurneys were thrown blocks away. In parts of the hospital parking lot and in a parking lot just to the west, 200- to 300-pound concrete parking stops, fastened into the asphalt with rebar, were lifted and tossed up to 180 feet, the weather service said. The hospital's helicopter lay crumpled, some distance away from its pad. X-rays from St. John's were found in driveways in Dade County, Missouri, about 70 miles away. The building looked as if it had been bombed. ""The houses are all gone,"" Sara Ferguson, who was near the hospital when the storm struck, told The Joplin Globe newspaper at the time. ""The medical buildings are gone. (The hospital) windows have all been blown out. It was horrible. I couldn't even take pictures on my phone. I was crying."" The hospital was very nearly the only structure in the immediate area left standing, albeit severely damaged. Hospital officials swung into action almost immediately. About 183 patients and 200 staffers were evacuated from the building. Triage centers were set up outside. Other hospitals in the area opened their doors for St. John's patients and others who had been injured. Doctors and nurses rushed to the scene. ""Within a matter of hours, we had almost more help than we could put to use,"" Dr. Jim Roscoe told CNN at the time. ""I just can't begin to tell you, we've had people coming from several hundreds of miles away, grabbing their stethoscope and anything they could get, and threw it in the car and came."" Across Joplin, people were also pulling together. The injured were transported to hospitals on doors in the back of pickup trucks. Businesses loaded trucks with donations. Restaurants helped provide food to those in need. ""You have shown the world what it means to love thy neighbor,"" President Barack Obama told the people of Joplin at a memorial service for the victims a week after the tornado. ""You've banded together ... you've demonstrated a simple truth: that amid heartbreak and tragedy, no one is a stranger."" That same day, St. John's was beginning to see patients in a tent facility set up across the parking lot. Built to withstand 100-mph winds, the facility had an emergency department, surgical suites, MRI and CT scan capabilities, a pharmacy and 60 inpatient beds, the hospital said. ""The building is not St. John's,"" Dr. Bob Dodson, who worked to set up the temporary facility, said at the time. ""St. John's is the people who worked in that building. And they're going to be the people in this building."" A modular hospital has since taken the place of the tent, said St. John's spokeswoman Miranda Lewis, and a more permanent structure was built nearby. The structure can be moved, and can be used to upgrade other facilities after St. John's moves into its new home, she said. In the days after the tornado, Mercy was ""a blessing,"" Shaw said. They continued paying their employees, he said, and set up the temporary facilities. ""You have to admire that they didn't let it defeat them."" In all, five buildings across 47 acres at the hospital site will be demolished and cleared, according to a statement from Mercy, St. John's parent company. Its facility is by far the largest, at about 750,000 square feet. Three medical offices and a rehabilitation facility will also be torn down. Typically, a building so large would be imploded. But underground lead mines made that an impossibility for St. John's. ""Joplin traces its roots back to the early miners who settled here in the late 1800s,"" said Dan O'Connor, the demolition project manager, in the statement. ""As is the case in many places throughout the city, those mines were filled in to make way for growth. While they can be made safe to build on, we don't want to take any chances that demolition charges and crashing debris could create an uplift pressure that might cause damage to surrounding properties."" Instead, a wrecking ball will demolish the hospital's west tower, and grappling equipment will be used to take down the east tower. The demolition process should take about six weeks, officials said. But before it began, crews searched the hospital for anything in good condition -- Bibles, artwork, memorial plaques, stained glass and marble. Teams began cleaning out and salvaging in December, the hospital said. Three time capsules were recovered -- one buried when the current hospital was built in 1968, one when the east tower was completed in the 1980s and a third that marked St. John's 100th anniversary in Joplin in 1996. And, of course, the cross. ""The cross certainly has some scars on it,"" said Terry Wachter, vice president of mission for St. John's, in the statement. ""But they just add character."" Many of the items recovered will either be relocated to the new hospital or placed in a tornado memorial museum, she said. Other pieces -- plastic piping from the sprinkler system, windows -- will be studied and tested to see how they weathered the storm. Meanwhile, officials are making efforts to limit the amount of debris that winds up in landfills from the demolition. Steel, aluminum and copper from the buildings is being salvaged and recycled, hospital officials said. Concrete and asphalt will be crushed into small pieces and used as backfill to ready the site for redevelopment. ""The devastation from the tornado was bad enough,"" said John Farnen, executive director of planning, design and construction for Mercy. ""We really want to take all the measures possible to care for this site throughout the demolition process."" Before the hospital comes down on Sunday, a demolition ceremony will be held on the hospital campus, part of several events designed to help Joplin ""say goodbye to the past and celebrate the future,"" Mercy said. The Missouri Highway Patrol will transport the cross to the new hospital site, located about 2 1/2 miles away at Interstate 44 and Main Street. A groundbreaking ceremony will be held there, ""a celebration of Mercy's future and the rebuilding of Joplin,"" according to Mercy. Mercy has invested nearly $1 billion to help rebuild Joplin's health care complex, according to its website. ""Though the tornado took our hospital, it did not destroy our spirit,"" the site says. ""Mercy is rising again in Joplin."" After the buildings are torn down, the land will be readied for development by Mercy. Twelve acres have been donated to the Joplin school district for a new elementary school that will replace two schools destroyed by the tornado; construction is set to begin in May. Options for the other acreage are being considered, Mercy said. Ideas under consideration include a memorial museum, a courtyard and a memorial garden. ""The future is just so bright,"" Shaw said, as Joplin's new hospital will be ""one of the most up-to-date facilities in the country."" Asked what the ceremonies might mean to Joplin residents, he said, ""Maybe the word is 'hope.'"" ""To me, you can dwell on all the debris, or you can think about what's going to rise up out of the debris,"" Shaw said. ""I kind of have a tendency to want to concentrate on the future.""","St. John's Mercy Hospital took a near-direct hit from an EF-5 tornado in May .

1916,"(CNN) -- I came to America as a transfer student in the fall of 2004. I did three years of computer engineering in India and then transferred to Purdue University Calumet. On July 2, 2005, just a month before graduation, a guy who lived on the first floor of my apartment building set fire to his place. He wrapped his baby in a blanket, put the baby in a car seat, put the car seat in the closet and then poured gasoline over the apartment with his baby and wife still in it. He then set the whole place on fire and left. The fire started at 4:30 a.m. My roommate and I could not jump out with the balcony and windows engulfed in flames. As my roommate fell unconscious in front of me, I started running down the stairs and passed out. A firefighter found my body and pulled me out. As the paramedics were taking me to the hospital, I heard one say, ""This guy is 95% burned; he doesn't have a chance."" At that moment, I thought about my family and how I came to America to get good education, and now I didn't have a chance to live. I was soon unconscious and later woke up in the University of Chicago burn unit after four months in an induced coma. The man's wife, his baby and my best friend and roommate, Prabhat Singhal, died in the fire. After seven months in Chicago, I was transferred to Wishard Health Services in Indianapolis for my rehabilitation. I don't have any family in America so I lived in a nursing home. I stayed there for 2Â½ years while I went through reconstructive surgeries to regain range of motion in my arms. For more than five years, I went through an intense therapy program. I wore a face mask for three years and pressure garments on my entire body; I wore dynamic splints on my hands, wrists and elbows to increase range of motion, daily dressing changes to my wounds and performing hourly exercises to restore function in all of my joints. I wanted to get an MBA so I studied in my extra time. I scheduled my Graduate Management Admission Test, or GMAT, exam and got a six-hour pass from the nursing home to take the test. I scored 700 on my GMAT and got accepted into the Indiana University Kelley School of Business Evening MBA program in Indianapolis. I wanted to go to a part-time program since I didn't know how much of a course load I would be able to take. Everyone gets their acceptance letter mailed to his home; I got my letter mailed to the nursing home. My doctors did everything they could to help me regain range of motion in my arms. Even after 54 surgeries, I am still very limited. I don't have any finger movement in my left hand and very limited finger movement in my right hand. I type with one finger. I rely on various adaptive equipments to perform my activities of daily living. This horrific crime not only left me with disabilities but also interfered with my visa. I have not seen most of my family in India since the accident seven years ago, because I am still waiting on a green card. My sister has been denied a visa four times in trying to visit me. I have been able to come out of this tragedy because of the values that my parents instilled in me and the help from my occupational therapist. My parents taught me the value of education, hard work and perseverance. They taught me to be content in life no matter what the circumstances. They taught me that ""we can always find someone who is in worse condition than we are in. So be thankful for what you have."" I call my occupational therapist, Shannon Hendricks, my guardian angel. God sent her into my life when I was in the deepest and darkest pit of my life. She took me to church every Sunday while I stayed in the nursing home, which brought some normalcy into my life. Today, I can live independently because of her hard work. After 3Â½ years, I graduated with my MBA on May 13. I am now seeking a job in finance. To give back to the community, I volunteered in the Wishard therapy department between many of my surgeries. I still visit the Wishard burn unit and talk to other burn patients about my experience. I also lecture at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis to occupational therapy students about all the adaptive equipment I use to live independently. I have had some wonderful people in my life who have helped me in my journey. I plan to do the same for other people.","Manoj Rana, a native of India, nearly died in an apartment fire after coming to study in the U.S.

1917,"(CNN) -- A wildfire that has raged for days in Michigan's Upper Peninsula has destroyed 97 structures -- including a motel, a store and 34 homes. The Duck Lake Fire has burned more than 22,000 acres and is still going despite recent rains, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources reported on its website. The state agency estimated Monday the blaze is about 51% contained, thanks to progress made by firefighters in maintaining a firm perimeter. Crews have about 40 miles of firelines set up to control the situation, including 6 miles along the shore of Lake Superior. But a lack of roads in the area has complicated efforts. The fire's south end is about 14 miles north of Newberry and 7 miles west of the Yahquamenon Falls State Park campgrounds. Lightning sparked the wildfire late Wednesday afternoon, leaving firefighters little time to contain it before dark. The flames picked up significantly the next day, fanned by strong winds and high temperatures. Since then, the wildfire has taken its toll. While noting that the entire affected area has not been surveyed, the state department said at least 97 structures on 39 different properties have been ""lost"" due to the blaze. Dry conditions have exacerbated the fire danger throughout the region. On Friday, Gov. Rick Snyder banned outdoor burning in 49 counties in northern Michigan in hopes of preventing wildfires.","The Duck Lake Fire is raging in Michigan's Upper Peninsula .

1918,"(CNN) -- The midair collision of two small planes about 50 miles from Washington is under investigation by Canadian officials because one plane was owned by an FAA employee and the other by an NTSB employee, federal officials said Tuesday. On Monday afternoon, a Piper PA-28 registered to a Federal Aviation Administration employee and a Beechcraft BE-35 owned by a National Transportation Safety Board employee collided in flight above Fauquier County, Virginia, authorities said. The pilot and a passenger of the BE-35 were killed, but the owner and pilot of the PA-28 survived with injuries, authorities said. NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman consulted with FAA Acting Administrator Michael Huerta and requested the Transportation Safety Board of Canada investigate the incident, she said in a statement Tuesday. ""This accident hits especially close to home, with the involvement of an NTSB employee,"" Hersman said. ""I'm grateful to TSB-Canada Chair Wendy Tadros for agreeing to conduct the investigation and the NTSB stands ready to support and assist them in any way we can."" An NTSB investigator will serve as a U.S. liaison to Canadian investigators, authorities said. The midair collision happened about five miles south of the Warrenton-Fauquier Airport around 4 p.m. Monday. ""One plane has been destroyed by fire,"" Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said on Monday. ""In that plane, which is believed to be a six-seater aircraft, two bodies have been recovered. State police are in the process of identifying the pilot and passenger."" The second plane's pilot, an adult male, was transported to Mary Washington Hospital in Fredericksburg, according to state police. The two planes crashed to the ground approximately a mile apart from one another, state police said. Parts of the planes and debris were scattered between the two crash sites in a secluded and difficult to access area, state police said. The cause of the crash remains under investigation, state police said. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Canada will investigate midair collision of two small planes .

1919,"(CNN) -- Indonesia's response to a massive earthquake and a tsunami scare Wednesday highlights a critical reality: Warning systems and emergency responses have come a long way since the catastrophe of eight years ago. But there's still work to be done -- not just in Indonesia, but in some other countries throughout the region as well. Fears that Wednesday's 8.6-magnitude quake and resulting tsunami alert could bring a repeat of the 2004 disaster dissipated quickly as seismologists determined that Wednesday's events were very different and much less dangerous. In the intervening hours, Indonesia put in place many of the procedures it has worked on for years, including some practiced at a drill witnessed by CNN in 2009. ""The lesson of 2004 is something that we're not going to repeat at this stage,"" vowed Teuku Faizasyah, a spokesman for the Indonesian president's office. Speaking to CNN while evacuations were under way in parts of his country, he said the government was working ""to bring confidence among the people that the government is with them."" Residents were being evacuated from some areas and encouraged to head to higher ground quickly, and authorities were trying to get information from remote areas, he said. Later, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center lifted a tsunami watch for the entire Indian Ocean, indicating the threat had passed. ""The tsunami warning system worked well,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency. ""People reacted quickly and evacuated to higher ground. Mosques, churches helped spread the information to the public. There was panic but that's expected."" No serious casualties or major damage was reported Wednesday from the quake and the 8.2-magnitude aftershock off the coast of Sumatra. Four people were slightly injured on Simeulue Island, off the coast of Aceh, the disaster management agency spokesman said. In 2004, a 9.1-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that ultimately killed nearly 230,000 people in the region. ""In 2004, the quake was closer to the coast, stronger and was a different kind of earthquake,"" CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. ""In 2004, the sea floor moved vertically, and this thrust displaced a lot of water, which produced the large tsunami. In this case, the plates moved more horizontally, and therefore a large tsunami was not generated."" ""Even though the epicenters were only about 200 miles (about 320 kilometers) apart, they occurred on different tectonic plates,"" CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller added. ""There are several plates that come together in this area, which is why it is so tectonically active. Today's quake occurred on the Indian plate, while the 2004 quake occurred on the Burma plate."" A 9.1-magnitude quake is 3.2 times larger, and more than 5 times stronger, than an 8.6-magnitude quake, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Tsunami warning sirens blared Wednesday in parts of Indonesia, and the other steps taken show that ""governments are more prepared,"" said CNN weather anchor Mari Ramos. ""There are sirens in place along coastal communities. There are buoys in the ocean to measure water level changes. There is better communication among government agencies, countries and the media. The word gets out much more quickly, and that helps saves lives,"" Ramos said. However, ""the number of measuring devices in the Indian Ocean is tiny compared to the Pacific. It's a start, but more are needed."" In October 2009, CNN's Dan Rivers visited the devastated Aceh region. He watched a well-organized tsunami drill, complete with droning alarms and people covered in fake blood fleeing from an imaginary wave. Authorities have built tsunami shelters that are raised high and can hold several hundred people, he said. Escape routes are marked. While it was not immediately clear how many people headed to higher ground Wednesday, some videos from the region showed people apparently leaving low-lying areas. That speaks to another important change from 2004: People are more aware of the danger. Back then, ""there was nothing,"" Rivers said. ""No one really knew what to do, no one even knew what a tsunami was."" Now, Ramos adds, ""Overall, the general population is much more aware."" The need for that awareness applies to citizens of other countries as well, said Walter Braunohler, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Thailand. ""Sadly, we did learn a lot of lessons from that (2004) natural disaster,"" he said Wednesday. ""And one of the biggest ones is that people should really keep in touch with their embassy."" Other countries in the region also reacted quickly to Wednesday's tsunami threat. Thailand issued an evacuation order for everyone along the Andaman coast Wednesday, according to state-run news agency MCOT. In the Maldives, some resorts were evacuated as a precaution, according to CNN's Erin Burnett, who was on vacation in the islands. But, she said, ""what strikes me most is essentially the lack of a warning system"" in the Maldives. Officials rely primarily on information from the U.S. Geological Survey, she said. That speaks to the problem the region still faces, Ramos said. ""The fact that the Maldives were included in the (warning center) bulletin is an improvement from 2004. But there's still a long way to go.""","NEW: The warning system worked well, Indonesia says .

1920,"(CNN) -- The parents of a New York Rangers player found dead in his apartment have decided to donate his brain to Boston University researchers studying the effects of concussion in athletes, a medical examiner's office said Sunday. New York Rangers enforcer Derek Boogaard was found dead Friday in his Minneapolis apartment. An autopsy was conducted Saturday, according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office in Minnesota, which confirmed that Boogaard's parents signed papers to donate Boogaard's brain. The office has not released a cause of death, saying it was waiting for toxicology test results that might not be determined for several weeks. Dr. Robert Stern, co-director for Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, confirmed Sunday that the family has donated Boogard's brain to the VA CSTE Brain Bank for study. The center has a donation registry for athletes to study effects of trauma on the brain and spinal cord. Boogaard, 28, began his NHL career with the Minnesota Wild. The Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, native joined the Rangers last July and appeared in 22 games during the 2010-11 season. ""Derek was an extremely kind and caring individual,"" New York Rangers President Glen Sather said on the team's website. ""He was a very thoughtful person, who will be dearly missed by all those who knew him. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family, friends and teammates during this difficult time."" Boogaard supported the Defending the Blue Line Foundation, a nonprofit that ensures the children of military personnel get the opportunity to play hockey. While with the Rangers, he created ""Boogaard's Booguardians,"" which hosted military families at home games, according to the website. CNN's Stephanie Smith contributed to this report.","The cause of the death of Derek Boogaard has not been determined .

1921,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he was overwhelmed and afraid during last year's nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, acknowledging that little has been done since then to ensure that another nuclear disaster will not occur. Sounding like a fiery anti-nuclear activist, Kan Monday testified before a panel appointed by parliament to investigate the nuclear disaster. ""There wasn't much information coming to me"" from the government regulatory agency, NISA, or the plant's operator, TEPCO, Kan said. ""I thought I couldn't make any countermeasures in this crisis. I felt fear."" During his testimony, Kan turned a critical finger on himself, Japan's bureaucrats and TEPCO, saying all were hoping the situation would not spiral more out of control. He said all often were more worried about protecting their jobs and turf than public safety. Kan specifically pointed to a request from TEPCO to evacuate the Fukushima plant -- a request he refused. ""The worst case scenario was that 30 million people would have to evacuate from the capital (Tokyo),"" Kan told the panel. ""That would come to within one inch of the end of this nation."" Kan said he did his best to share information with the public, but admitted there weren't many verified facts to share. Over the weekend, Yukio Edano, Kan's former chief cabinet secretary, testified that his office rejected a U.S. offer to supply nuclear experts, saying it was ""not appropriate."" Kan told the panel that he heard about the U.S. offer after the fact, but supported Edano's decision. Kan also spoke about Japan's so-called ""nuclear village."" That's the term used to describe the utilities, nuclear regulators, bureaucrats and academics who support the usage of nuclear energy in Japan. It's a group Kan said shows no remorse for the disaster. The first priority of Japan's new nuclear policy should be to dismantle the power of the nuclear village, along with all nuclear power plants, Kan said. ""I would like to say to the Japanese and to the world -- the safest nuclear policy is not to have any nuclear plants.""","Kan says his government refused the help of U.S. nuclear experts .

A spokeswoman for the British Foreign Office said three British nationals who were near the governor's compound were injured when the blast went off. Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who's currently in Europe, condemned the attack, a presidential spokesman said.","Three British nationals were wounded in the attack, an official says .

1923,"Joplin, Missouri (CNN) -- The tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri, Sunday killed 124 people, authorities said Tuesday, in what was the deadliest single U.S. tornado since modern record-keeping began 61 years ago. An estimated 750 people have been treated at area hospitals, said Joplin City Manager Mark Rohr, who told residents of the tornado-ravaged town to be prepared in case a new wave of destructive storms strikes. A tornado warning was issued, then canceled, Tuesday night for Joplin. The storm involved likely will pass well north of the city, said forecasters. They predicted Joplin could still get hit by strong wind gusts of more than 70 miles per hour. On a brighter note, rescue workers pulled two more people alive from the rubble within the last 24 hours, Rohr said. Also Tuesday, forecasters raised their assessment of the Sunday storm, ranking it at the top of the scale used to rate tornadoes. The National Weather Service has determined the twister packed top winds of more than 200 mph, making it a 5 on the enhanced Fujita scale, said Bill Davis, the meteorologist who reviewed the damage. Davis said the tornado left ""about six miles of total destruction"" in its wake. Examinations of some of the buildings destroyed or damaged convinced forecasters to raise the designation, he said. Roughly 8,000 structures within the city of Joplin were damaged, Rohr said, citing a Federal Emergency Management Agency report. A previous estimate had put the number of buildings damaged or destroyed at 2,000. Among the dead in Joplin were 10 residents and a staff member at a nursing home, a company official said. Two other staffers at Greenbriar Nursing Home are in critical condition at a hospital, said the home's vice president, Bill Mitchell. Of the other 79 residents of the home, all but one are accounted for, he said. Only rubble remains and survivors have been moved to temporary housing or are with family members. ""It just looks like a war zone,"" said Eddie Atwood in a CNN iReport from the scene. From where he stood, Atwood said, ""You could see all the way to the horizon because all the houses and all the trees were just leveled."" ""I was walking down Main Street. Everything was so razed over, it was disorienting because some of the streets -- you couldn't even tell where you were at. After living in Joplin all my life it was like living in the twilight zone."" Joplin is not in the clear yet as far as weather goes: The National Weather Service warned there is a chance of another tornado outbreak -- with the peak time ending at midnight Tuesday -- over a wide swath including parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Nebraska and Missouri. Already Tuesday evening, at least four people were killed and many more injured when a deadly string of tornadoes and thunderstorms cut through central Oklahoma, officials said. Joplin Police Chief Lane Roberts said the city was imposing a curfew Tuesday night in areas struck by the tornado to head off the threat of looting. ""The sole function is to reduce the opportunity for people to loot and steal, and we're hoping the folks who live in that area will cooperate with us,"" he said. President Barack Obama announced he will visit the region on Sunday. ""We are going to do absolutely everything we can to make sure they recover,"" he said during a visit to London. Obama added that he will let people know ""the whole country is going to be behind them."" ""We are here for you. We're going to stay by you,"" Obama said. Richard Serino, the second-highest-ranking official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Monday that Obama had issued a disaster declaration -- expediting the dispersal of federal resources to the area -- while vowing that ""we are going to be here for the long haul."" City Manager Rohr told reporters Tuesday that more than 40 agencies were on the ground in the southwest Missouri city, and two first responders were struck by lightning Monday as they braved relentless rain and high wind searching for survivors. ""One, fortunately, walked away from it; the other one's still in the hospital, last I heard,"" Joplin Emergency Management Director Keith Stammer said on CNN's ""American Morning."" About 1,500 people are still unaccounted for. But ""when we open up the area and start letting them come back in ... that number of unaccounted for will start to dwindle,"" Stammer said. Many of those 1,500 have scattered because of tornado damage and communication problems. Joplin Fire Chief Mitch Randles said the second search and rescue effort basically follows the tornado's path. ""We're searching every structure that's been damaged or destroyed in a more in-depth manner,"" he said. ""The third search is going to be similar to that. And then the fourth search through will be with the search-and-rescue dogs."" Authorities encouraged people to use the website safeandwell.org, operated by the Red Cross, for updates on loved ones. Some residents said the tornado struck suddenly. ""It all happened so fast,"" Rachael Neff said on CNN's ""American Morning"" Tuesday. ""It seemed like forever but it happened very fast."" ""We had a few minutes' warning. I've never taken any of the warnings seriously but something snapped in me and I put blankets and pillows in the bathroom. We were running to the bathroom. You could hear the home shaking, everything busting out."" Neff, her fiance, Zac Bronson, and her toddler prayed, screamed and survived. ""We've had a tremendous support system. Our employers, friends and family have been more than helpful and we move on and rebuild. We just start another life. We started a new life,"" Bronson said. By Monday night, officials found 17 people alive. But many, including Will Norton, remain missing. The 18-year-old was driving home from his high school graduation Sunday when the tornado destroyed the Hummer H3 he and his father were in. ""We were in a separate car. We were about 30 seconds in front of them, one block,"" Norton's sister, Sara, told CNN. ""My dad called and he said, 'Open the garage door.' ... And then I just heard him say, 'Pull over, Will. Pull over.' And then they started flipping."" ""My dad said -- when my dad gained consciousness, he said that he saw my brother -- his seat belt snapped and he was ejected through the sunroof,"" she added. The family has been tracking a ""Help Find Will Norton"" Facebook page and pursuing leads on his whereabouts. Norton's aunt, Tracey, said the family received a tip that the teen was listed on a local hospital's emergency room roster -- but she's not sure where he is now. ""They transferred him, but we're not sure where he was transferred,"" the aunt said. ""When he was transferred, he was alive. We don't know anything other than that."" The tornado that carved through the city of about 50,000 on Sunday is the deadliest to hit American soil since the National Weather Service began keeping records 61 years ago. The National Weather Service notes seven deadlier twisters, but says those took place ""before the years of comprehensive damage surveys,"" so they may have been the result of multiple tornadoes. But the Weather Service does say that the Great Tri-State Tornado of 1925, which tore across southeast Missouri, southern Illinois and southwest Indiana, killed 695 people -- ""a record for a single tornado."" A 1953 twister in Flint, Michigan, killed 116 people, according to the Weather Service. Last month, two fatal twisters struck Alabama. One hit Hackleburg and the town of Phil Campbell, killing 78 people, and another struck Tuscaloosa and Birmingham, killing 61. With crews still sifting through rubble, the death toll could continue to climb. ""I think the more time that goes by, the more I feel sick about it,"" Sarah Hale, a lifelong Joplin resident, said Tuesday. ""These people are cold and sick and stuck. As the days go on, and the death toll goes up, how many funerals are we going to go to?"" Joplin Mayor Mike Woolston said Monday night that his community hasn't given up. ""We hope that there are people alive. We have a number of apartment buildings, complexes that are almost completely flattened. So we anticipate finding more people, and hopefully we'll get there in time to find them alive,"" he said. The tornado chewed through a densely populated area of the city, eliminating a high school and making a direct hit on one of the two hospitals in the city. Woolston pledged not to let the tornado ruin his city. ""This is just not the type of community that's going to let a little F-4 tornado kick our ass. So we will rebuild, and we will recover."" CNN's Chuck Johnston, Joe Sutton, Greg Botelho, Holly Yan, Marlena Baldacci, Mike Pearson, Jessica Jordan, Sean Morris and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: A tornado warning is issued, then canceled, for Joplin .

1924,"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The numbers tell a small part of the story: Eight dead in a bomb blast. The names that police have released so far reveal a little more. Anne Lise Holter, 51. Tove Ashill Knutsen, 56. Hanna M. Orvik Endresen, 61. Kai Hauge, 32. But a 16-minute video shot in the immediate aftermath of the explosion in Oslo, Norway, brings home the horror of what happened there on July 22 in a completely different way. It's not so much the sight of papers fluttering out of the shattered windows of office buildings, or even the red cables sticking out of the ripped concrete pavement. It's the sounds. The whimpering of a woman near tears moments after the bomb blast. The constant crunch of broken glass underfoot. The urgency in the voices of passersby trying to help the wounded. The insistent alarm bell ringing a three-second warning, pausing as if for breath, and ringing again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And finally, the siren of a single ambulance, long after the explosion that smashed Norway's calm. The video was shot by Johan Christian Tandberg, who was driving through a tunnel under the government building that was the target of the attack when the bomb went off. Authorities have charged Anders Behring Breivik, an apparent right-wing extremist with a hatred of Muslims and multi-culturalism, with setting off the bomb. He's also charged in the shooting deaths of 68 people at a Labour Party youth camp on Utoya island, where he eventually surrendered to police. His lawyer says he admits carrying out the attacks. People all over Norway sat in front of their televisions and cried when they heard the next day how many people had died, and they are still crying, Tandberg told CNN Thursday. What he saw when he came out of the tunnel last week ""looked like a war zone,"" he said, adding that he immediately thought of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States. He grabbed a camera and started filming on the spot. The resulting video shows central Oslo littered with street signs ripped out of the ground by the blast, insulation torn from buildings, and people wandering in shock. He follows a man though a damaged building, looking for wounded people but finding only offices in complete disarray, furniture tossed around and ceiling panels hanging down. Back on the streets, at least one person is seen with a cut on his leg, and several people cluster around another casualty. All the faces in the video are blurred. An emergency services worker makes an urgent-sounding call into a radio. Smoke rises over a building in the near distance. Tree branches litter the ground. A woman weeps. And the alarm bell rings. And rings. And rings.","Johan Christian Tandberg was at the scene when a bomb went off .

1925,"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi vowed Tuesday that ""we will not surrender,"" even as NATO airstrikes bombarded his compound in Tripoli. ""I am now speaking as planes and bombs fall around me,"" Gadhafi said in a live audio broadcast on state television. ""But my soul is in God's hand. We will not think about death or life. We will think about the call of duty."" At least three explosions rocked Tripoli late Tuesday night; it was not immediately clear what they hit. Earlier in the day, NATO targeted a military base and Gadhafi's compound, state television reported. A spokesman for the Libyan government said that at least 31 people were killed, including a number of civilians, and dozens more were wounded after 60 missiles struck the capital city. The compound was under ""intensive continuous bombardment,"" according to state TV, which reported buildings and infrastructure were destroyed. ""We will not surrender, we will not give up,"" Gadhafi said. ""We have one option -- our country. We will remain in it 'til the end. Dead, alive, victorious, it doesn't matter."" The blasts Tuesday, and others Monday that Libyan officials said hit state television buildings, elicited heated responses from the government spokesman. ""We believe NATO understands that its military campaign is failing miserably,"" said spokesman Musa Ibrahim. ""No one has the right to shape Libya's future except for Libyans."" Ibrahim said Tuesday's morning blasts hit the popular guard compound and revolution compound, which are military barracks near Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound. The spokesman said the attack on the television network killed two people and wounded 16. NATO disputed the account. ""We did not target or hit the Libyan broadcast facilities. What we did target was the military intelligence headquarters in downtown Tripoli,"" the alliance said. ""The story coming from Libyan officials that we targeted and hit the state broadcaster's building is bogus."" The back and forth between Libyan officials and NATO continues a public relations war between the two sides. Libyan officials have continually charged that NATO airstrikes have damaged civilian facilities and killed hundreds of civilians. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said recently that his forces have made ""significant progress"" in its U.N. Security Council mandate to protect Libyan civilians. This week, the Libyan government said it had evidence that alliance airstrikes were harming civilians. Officials took journalists to Tajura, a city east of Tripoli, to show them a small crater that held what appeared to be the remains of a rocket. The reporters were also taken to nearby homes that the government said had been damaged by airstrikes. NATO said it had been active in the area hitting military sites but could not say whether the attacks had caused the damage in the residential area. Reporters were also taken to a nearby hospital to see Nasib, a comatose baby who was a victim of the airstrikes, the government said. A woman, who the government said was Nasib's mother, cried over the child's listless body. Journalists were not allowed to talk to the woman or to the doctors. But one doctor quietly slipped a note to one of the journalists that said the girl was injured in a car accident, not a bomb attack. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking Tuesday to British lawmakers, said the European Union has added six additional ports controlled by pro-Gadhafi forces to its sanctions list in an effort to starve Gadhafi's troops of military supplies. He said the United Kingdom intends to push for additional sanctions against Gadhafi's regime. ""Any political settlement in Libya requires an end to violence and Gadhafi's departure,"" Hague said. CNN's Raja Razek, Dan Rivers and Jonathan Wald contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 31 killed in Libya, including civilians, Libyan government spokesman says .

1926,"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese officials have formally honored a bus driver for saving the lives of 24 people when he managed to stop the bus after being struck by a piece of flying sheet metal that came crashing through his windshield. Wu Bin, the 48-year-old bus driver, collapsed shortly after pulling over. He died on Friday, three days after the accident in Zhejiang province, eastern China. On Tuesday, the Zhejiang provincial government awarded Wu the title of ""Provincial Labor Model"", according to a statement from the government office. Local officials said all citizens should learn from Wu's selfless act. Similarly, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions awarded Wu the ""May 1st Labor Medal,"" one of the highest honors for Chinese workers. But officials aren't the only ones praising Wu for his actions. Between 2,000 and 3,000 people attended his funeral Tuesday morning, a staff member at the Hangzhou Funeral Home told CNN. People began showing up at 5 a.m. for the 8 a.m. funeral , the staff member said. A procession held Monday through the streets of Hangzhou in Zhejiang province where Hu worked also drew thousands of mourners, including dozens of transportation workers, according to the state-run Shanghai Daily. Police told the Shanghai Daily that they have narrowed the search to nine vehicles that might be the source of the errant piece of metal and they plan to prosecute whoever is responsible.","Chinese government honors bus driver who pulled over despite being fatally injured .

1927,"(CNN) -- A typhoon off the coast of the Philippines is fueling monsoon rains, which flooded the capital city of Manila and could trigger flash floods and landslides, forecasters said on Wednesday. The Philippine government said Typhoon Kabayan was expected to enhance the monsoon over the entire island of Luzon, where Manila is located, according to the country's National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council. The storm system has maximum winds of 102 mph (165 kph) and gusts over 124 mph (200 kph), the council reported. It is forecast to be about 100 miles off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, by Thursday evening. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said that the western part of Luzon will experience monsoon rains on Wednesday, which could cause flash floods and landslides. The typhoon was reported to be some 656 miles (1,055 km) east-northeast of Basco, Batanes early Wednesday morning. Government officials said relief goods have been positioned in areas that could be affected by the typhoon, according to the Philippines News Agency. Officials suspended government work and college classes Tuesday because of the heavy rains, the agency said. Veronica Lon, a CNN iReporter, said about 35% of metropolitan Manila is submerged under water and hundreds of families are in evacuation centers. ""This is a unusual scene in our city and always, it only takes a few minutes for the flood to form,"" Lon said. ""More than half the city and about 75% of metro Manila area had floods,"" she said.","NEW: Flash floods and landslides are possible, forecasters say .

1928,"Rome (CNN) -- Rescuers searching the stricken Costa Concordia found a body on bridge 3 Tuesday, bringing the number of confirmed dead from the wreck to 16, civil protection officials said. The discovery leaves about 16 people still missing from among the roughly 4,200 aboard the cruise liner -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- at the time of the collision with rocks off the island of Giglio. The vast majority fled the ship safely, if under chaotic and frightening conditions, according to survivors. Undersea salvage experts will not start siphoning fuel off the partially sunken liner before Saturday, the man in charge of the operation said Tuesday. Teams of divers have begun to set up the operation, Franco Gabrielli said in remarks televised from Giglio. His comments appear to contradict a timetable laid out Monday by an Italian admiral, who said that salvage workers were to begin pumping fuel out of the liner that day. Adm. Ilarione Dell'Anna said it would take 28 working days to remove all the fuel from the ship. Gabrielli did not explain the discrepancy. He has asked the company that owns the ship to come up with a plan to clean up pollution from the vessel, such as garbage, by Wednesday, he said. The search for survivors and victims will continue alongside the salvage, said Gabrielli. The man in charge of the rescue operation said the divers faced a grim task. ""Imagine that you left for holidays and that the power went off in your house. What would you find in your fridge? The divers are in there,"" Ennio Aquilino said. Two bodies were found on Monday, and two more over the weekend -- one woman on Saturday and one on Sunday, both wearing life jackets. Divers used explosives Monday morning to blow more holes in the side of the ship to allow easier access. The parties involved in the rescue told reporters and residents on the island Sunday that search and rescue efforts will continue -- but that the environmental risk is also becoming urgent. Officials said they cannot predict how long it will take to clear the wreckage, since that depends on maritime conditions and technical difficulties, but all legal, environmental and human factors will be taken into account. ""It's time for Italy to show it can do something right and do it well,"" said Gabrielli. He warned that the task ahead was complicated and daunting, not least because it takes about 45 minutes to search each cabin, using special cameras and divers. The giant Costa Concordia had 1,500 cabins on board. A class-action lawsuit will be filed in Miami against Costa and its parent company, Carnival Corp., the Italian consumer group Codacons said Saturday. The suit, in collaboration with two U.S. law firms, is ""aimed specifically at getting compensation for all damages to the boat passengers,"" Codacons said in a statement. The class-action suit is open to passengers of any nationality, it said. ""We've been contacted by hundreds of victims and the numbers are growing moment by moment,"" said Mitchell Proner, senior partner at Proner & Proner, one of two firms involved. He said crew members have also contacted the firm, ""and their stories that are coming in are horrific -- from lifeboats that were stuck halfway, passengers debating whether to jump or not. This was not an orderly evacuation."" The suit, he said, will request at least 125,000 euros (about $160,000) per passenger. The suit has not yet been filed, said Marc Bern, senior partner at the other firm, Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik, but ""it will probably be in the billions of euros and dollars."" ""The sheer terror of being on a ship of that magnitude going down, you can imagine the psychological damage,"" Bern said. Meanwhile, Gabrielli said no fuel oil had yet leaked from the ship -- only kitchen and engine oil -- and that he did not see an immediate risk of the 2,400 tons on board escaping. Booms have been put in place around the ship to stop the spread of oil and other pollutants such as detergents and sewage chemicals. With more than 4,000 people aboard, the ship was the size of a small town, Gabrielli said. Fuel will be replaced with water as it is removed from the ship's tanks, keeping the ship balanced, said Dell'Anna, head of coastal authorities for the port city of Livorno. Gabrielli said Costa Cruises, the company that owns the cruise ship, is cooperative and was proving responsible, despite past errors. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. Schettino maintains his innocence.

1929,"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- There is a predictable pattern that ensues following any tragic news in Nigeria. There is at first a collective sense of shock and grief. There follows official visits to the scene of the tragedy. Families are condoled and money is doled out in compensation. A period of mourning is inevitably announced. In a country where nothing happens quickly, committees and investigative panels will then be set up with remarkable alacrity. Months will pass. And then nothing. The result is always the same. Rhetoric, followed by vacuous proclamations but ultimately, inaction. The banal sequence has already begun playing out with news of Sunday's fatal air crash in Lagos which claimed over 150 lives. This time, however, Nigerians are demanding answers. Accidents do happen of course but the memories of January's mass protests are fresh and there lingers a suspicion of government negligence. It is far too early to determine the outcome of the crash but early indications are that this was an entirely avoidable disaster. See also: Nigerians no longer 'suffering and smiling' The investigation must begin with Dana Air, operators of the ill fated Boeing MD-83. The irony is that the Indian-owned airline has quite a decent track record since they began operations in Nigeria four years ago. With a modest number of four aircraft in its fleet, the airline had grown at a reasonable pace and had just taken delivery of another Boeing MD-83 in May. A strong focus on domestic services and competitive fares had seen Dana Air become the airline of choice for many regular fliers. There were signs, however, in the last six months that standards had begun to slip. First came the irregular take-off times. Dana flights, once paragons of punctuality, started taking off late or sometimes not at all. The delays were quite often without reason. On 15 May this year, I waited with other passengers for over six hours to board as engineers addressed a mechanical problem on one of its planes. On a separate occasion, we were to board the last Dana Flight out of Lagos to Abuja. The flight was canceled and no explanation given. There was no offer of compensation either. Dana Air has also faced accusations of penny-pinching. Even before Sunday's crash, there had been suggestions that Dana's four aircraft were being overworked. See also: iReport images from Lagos . On Sunday alone, the aircraft with registration number 5N-RAM was already on its fourth trip of the day and scheduled to make another one. In May, the same aircraft had to make two unscheduled air returns following reports of engine failure, according to a Dana Air station manager in Lagos. Whatever the outcome of the investigation, the omens are not good for Dana Air. No Nigerian airline has ever fully recovered from an air disaster. EAS Airlines, Bellview, SoSoLiso and ADC Air were all Nigerian airlines with decent sized fleets and considerable goodwill just ten years ago. Their names all became obsolete pretty quickly following a spate of crashes between 2002 and 2006. The government has taken the step of withdrawing their operational license and ground Dana aircraft whilst an inquiry takes place. Even in the event of continued operations, there would have been a likely slump in passenger bookings which will harm the airline. The investigation must go beyond Dana and extend to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). The main regulator of the country's airline industry will need to face some tough questions as well. Did they do enough to minimize the chance of such a crash? The Dana Air was 22 years old, which is not exactly ancient in aviation terms but given that Nigerian law prohibits aircraft over the age of 20 from operating, who fell asleep at the switch? Besides at that age, any aircraft would require maintenance checks to be as regular as they are vigorous. Separate eyewitness accounts of leaking hydraulics on the MD-83 do not suggest that this was the case. This time around the Nigerian public is in no mood for obfuscation or cover-ups. The last major air incident in Nigeria was in October 2006 when an ADC airlines flight crashed near Abuja and killed 96 on board. The outcome of the subsequent investigation was never revealed but now there is a growing demand that such information is shared with the public. Following that crash, the government grounded all commercial aircraft and revoked the licenses of many. Air worthiness became a paramount issue and as a result the slack operators were forced to tighten up. Those that could not shape up exited the scene. On that occasion it took over 500 deaths in five years to shake the government into action. If laxity has started to creep back into Nigeria's aviation sector, one hopes that it will not take a similar rash of incidents to ensure that safety standards are being consistently met.

1930,"New York (CNN) -- Candles used in voodoo sex ceremony caused a fatal five alarm fire after they tipped over and ignited bed sheets in a Brooklyn, New York, apartment, authorities said Friday. The fire left an elderly woman dead and injured 20 firefighters and three Brooklyn residents, according to a New York Fire Department statement. A voodoo priest allegedly placed the candles on the floor around the bed on Saturday after a woman paid him $300 to perform a ceremony with a sexual component, that was meant to bring her good luck, fire department officials said. The candles were accidentally knocked over during the ceremony prompting the man to douse the flames with water and open a window in an effort to clear smoke from the room, the statement said. Forty mile-per-hour wind gusts instead shot the flames back inside the room, it said, creating a ""blowtorch effect"" that whipped through the open window and pushed the fire into the building's fourth floor hallway. ""Time and time again we respond to tragedies that could have been so easily prevented,"" Fire Commissioner Salvatore J. Cassano said in the statement. ""This fire had so many of those elements ... hopefully others will learn from this tragedy."" The occupants fled the apartment, leaving the door open, the statement said. Nearly 200 firefighters from 44 companies took seven hours to bring the fire under control. Authorities are currently investigating the incident.","Candles used in ceremony caused a fatal five alarm in a Brooklyn, New York .

1931,"(CNN) -- A South Carolina woman battling a rare flesh-eating bacteria infection has been upgraded to fair condition and is tentatively scheduled for skin-grafting surgery, her family said Thursday. Lana Kuykendall has been in Greenville Memorial Hospital since she was admitted on May 11, four days after giving birth to twins, Ian and Abigail, in Atlanta. ""She has improved tremendously over the last week,"" said her husband, Darren Kuykendall. ""Although she is still in ICU, we believe she is on the road to recovery."" WYFF: New mom with flesh-eating bacteria sees twins . The constant IV drips of sedative and pain medicine have stopped and she is receiving them only as needed, Kuykendall said. ""She looks more and more like herself."" She has undergone almost 20 surgical procedures to treat and contain the spread of the necrotizing fasciitis, according to a statement from the hospital. Advocate: Story of rare bacterial infection raising awareness . ""The treatment required aggressive surgical intervention, but not amputations,"" the statement said. ""In addition to surgeries, she also underwent extensive hyperbaric oxygen therapy."" The recovery process will be slow, according to the hospital's epidemiologist. However, ""We believe she has turned the corner,"" Dr. Bill Kelly said. Kuykendall has had ""longer periods of alertness and tries to respond to the people in the room and the conversations going on around her"" over the last few days, the statement said. ""She is able to communicate by blinking her eyes, raising her eyebrows, pointing and mouthing words."" The 1-month-old twins, a boy and a girl, visited their mother for the first time at the hospital on Wednesday, the statement said. They are being cared for by relatives. Georgia flesh-eating bacteria victim speaks, jokes, father says . ""Lana grinned from ear to ear when she was holding them,"" her husband said. Kuykendall, a paramedic, went to the hospital after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg, her husband, a firefighter, said last month. She was diagnosed then with necrotizing fasciitis, according the hospital. A number of bacteria, which are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections, can lead to the disease. When it gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remains. iReport: Surviving a flesh-eating disease . The disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimated that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise because doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. CNN's Jennifer Bixler contributed to this report.","Lana Kuykendall has had a rare flesh-eating bacteria since May 11 .

1933,"(CNN) -- Officials will conduct an autopsy Monday on Mark Niver, a drag racer who died when the parachute came off the back of his dragster -- sending him slamming into the netting at the end of the track. Niver, 60, was taking part in the National Hot Rod Association's Lucas Oil Northwest Nationals in Seattle, Washington, on Sunday. After the parachute came off, he was able to slow the car a bit before plowing into the net fencing at the end of the drag strip. The death was the second this year in the association's drag racing series. Race announcers called Niver ""a true craftsman and an innovator"" who hand-built all his race cars from start to finish -- he machined his engines and components and fabricated the car bodies.

1934,"(CNN) -- The sole survivor of a shooting last month at a Cracker Barrel Old Country Store and Restaurant near Cleveland died Tuesday, her family said. Kayla Allen was wounded April 12 when her father opened fire on the family, killing Kayla's mother and sister. She took a turn for the worse last week, according to a post on a Facebook page set up to help share news about her health and raise funds. ""Kayla, in a perfect body, with no pain or sadness, is in heaven with her mother, sister and our Lord Jesus Christ. Her suffering is over. She is in an eternal paradise,"" read another post on that page Tuesday. Her family confirmed the news through a written statement. ""Kayla has died peacefully at home. She has been surrounded by family and friends for the past few days, comfortable and serene. This time has been most meaningful to us as we held her and loved her, prayed for her and said our goodbyes,"" it read. The shooting took place after police received a 911 call from a woman at the restaurant in Brooklyn, Ohio, that ""she had just informed her husband that she was leaving him and he wasn't taking it well,"" Police Chief Scott Mielke said then. The woman told police her husband was in a car circling the eatery. When officers arrived, they heard gunshots and encountered a man leaving the restaurant with a gun. When the gunman failed to surrender to authorities, they fatally shot him. In addition to the gunman, a woman and a girl were dead at the scene. Kayla was wounded and transported to a local hospital for treatment. CNN's Jake Carpenter contributed to this report.","Kayla Allen was wounded April 12 when her father opened fire on the family .

1935,"(CNN) -- U.S. Coast Guard officers continued to search for survivors Tuesday after a boat carrying 28 Haitian migrants ran into trouble in the Bahamas while on its way to the United States, leading to at least 11 deaths. Thirteen people are believed missing, the U.S. Coast Guard said Tuesday. Four of those on board made it safely to shore Monday and raised the alarm with the Bahamas police force, U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Jon-Paul Rios said. The hunt for survivors continued early Tuesday, with U.S. Coast Guard officers scanning the seas from the air and Bahamian police conducting surface searches. The Haitians' vessel ran aground and broke up near Hawksbill Cay in the Bahamas, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard sent three aircraft, one of them a rescue helicopter, to the scene after Bahamian authorities asked for help and recovered 11 bodies there, Rios said. Rescued Haitian migrant boat refugee becomes Coast Guard rescuer . Capt. Brendan McPherson, 7th Coast Guard District chief of response enforcement, said it was a ""tragic and preventable loss of life,"" in a statement Tuesday. ""As we continue our efforts to locate any survivors, the Coast Guard urges family members everywhere to plead with loved ones overseas who might wish to immigrate to the U.S. to only do so through safe and lawful means,"" he said. The United States has long been a destination for migrants from Haiti, with many sailing via the Bahamas or the Turks and Caicos Islands. Boats overflowing with migrants fleeing persecution under the regime of Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier began landing on U.S. shores in the 1970s. Others sought refuge after the collapse of the Duvalier dictatorship in the late 1980s, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Council urges probe of sinking refugee boats . In the early 1990s, tens of thousands more Haitians migrated to the United States after the coup d'etat deposing President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The January 2010 earthquake that devastated the capital, Port au Prince, and surrounding communities did not result in an immediate wave of mass migration to the United States, as some had feared. Nonetheless, about 587,000 Haitian-born people were living in the United States as of 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, about half of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens. That number had climbed from 408,000 in 2000 and 218,000 in 1990, according to a 2010 report by the U.S.-based Center for Immigration Studies, citing earlier census figures. At least 16 dead after migrant boat sinks near Dominican Republic . Nearly half the migrants from Haiti have settled in Florida, with New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts also attracting sizable communities, the CIS report says. A fifth of Haitian immigrants and their young children residing in the United States live in poverty, it adds. The Haitian diaspora has traditionally helped its Caribbean homeland recover from natural disasters, with large sums sent back to Haiti in remittances, the Migration Policy Institute says. The United Nations estimates the January 2010 earthquake affected nearly 3 million people and killed about 220,000. More than 1.5 million people were left homeless in a country that was already the poorest in the Western Hemisphere and racked by crisis.

1936,"(CNN) -- The assistant coach of Togo's national soccer team is among the victims of Friday's machine-gun attack on a bus carrying the squad to a tournament in Angola, the country's official news agency reported Saturday. As many as three people were killed and nine injured in the strike, which prompted the team to decide Saturday to pull out of the Africa Cup of Nations tourney. Angola's official ANGOP news agency reported that assistant coach Hamelet Abulo and a Togolese journalist died Saturday. There were conflicting reports about the driver of the bus. Fraser Lamond -- regional medical director of SOS International, a group that transports injured people to hospitals -- said the driver was among the dead, but Togo government officials indicated he was still alive. Lamond said a third wounded person was being evacuated to Johannesburg, South Africa, for treatment. ANGOP reported that goalkeeper Kodjovi Kadja, was sent to South Africa for an injury to his back. It was unclear whether Lamond and ANGOP were referring to the same person. The team was headed to Angola for the tournament when it was attacked near the border between Angola and the Republic of Congo. An armed wing of a separatist group -- the Forces for Liberation of the State of Cabinda (FLEC) -- has claimed responsibility for the attack and has threatened to strike again. CNN cannot independently verify the claim. Emmanuel Adebayor, the Togo team's captain and a star for England's Manchester City team, said he and his teammates met Saturday morning ""before deciding that they wished to pull out of the tournament,"" the Manchester City Football Club Web site said. He was not injured in the attack, Manchester City said. ""It's as if we've gone to war,"" said goalkeeper Kossi Agassa. ""It's deplorable for Africa. I don't know what other countries will decide, but it's hard. Too hard for us footballers."" Angolan officials -- trying to assuage security fears that could dampen the war-torn nation's sporting aspirations -- vowed to heighten security, particularly in Cabinda, a disputed oil-rich enclave located within the Democratic Republic of Congo and the site of eight matches in the tournament. Togo had been scheduled to play Ghana on Monday in Cabinda. ""We vehemently condemn the ignoble action, lament the loss of lives, and we reiterate our commitment to guarantee security so that the CAN ORANGE 2010 (tournament) will firm itself as a great sporting event and a manifestation of friendship and solidarity among the African people,"" an Angolan government statement said. Arriving Saturday with a high-level delegation to Cabinda, Angola's Prime Minister Antonio Paulo Cassoma insisted his government provided proper security. ""Security was guaranteed. Nevertheless ... we will provide more security and protection to the delegations,"" Cassoma told Angola's TPA Television. Leaders of the Confederation of African Football were expected to meet Saturday with Cassoma ""to take decisions to guarantee the smooth running of the competition,"" a statement on that organization's Web site said. Host nation Angola is scheduled to kick off the tournament against Mali on Sunday in Luanda. The tournament -- one of the world's biggest -- is Angola's first major sporting event since a 2002 peace deal brought the southern African country's decades-old civil war to an end. It also marks the beginning of a year in the spotlight for African football, with South Africa set to become the continent's first country to host the FIFA World Cup in June. The Angola tournament has been eagerly anticipated as an early chance to assess the form of African powerhouses such as Drogba and Toure's Ivory Coast, Essien's Ghana and Eto'o's Cameroon ahead of the World Cup. Football world government body FIFA said it was ""deeply moved"" by the incident and expressed ""utmost sympathy"" with the Togolese players. It said it expected a full report from the CAF on the situation. Togo striker Thomas Dossevi, who plays for French team Nantes, told CNN ""armed rebels"" with AK-47s had opened fire. ""We were attacked by armed rebels who used Kalashnikovs. We had just passed the border and a couple of minutes later we were attacked from both sides. ""We hid below the seats -- we had police protection in front and behind but we were attacked from both sides. As soon as I heard the bullets I went to the floor. ... The attack lasted for 10-15 minutes, "" Dossevi said. Cabinda is located within the Democratic Republic of Congo. A strip of that nation separates it from Angola, one of the world's largest energy producers and a major supplier of petroleum and liquefied natural gas to the U.S. market. Angola, which was wracked by civil war for nearly three decades, brokered a peace deal in 2006 with separatists seeking an independent republic of Cabinda. Togo is a strip of a nation that averages about 60 miles wide, nestled between Benin and Ghana in West Africa. It is smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia.","NEW: Angola news agency: Togo assistant coach Hamelet Abulo, Togolese journalist dead .

1937,"(CNN) -- The chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party died Wednesday, about four hours after a shooting at the party's headquarters, police said. Police block off the streets surrounding the state Democratic Party headquarters Wednesday in Little Rock. Chairman Bill Gwatney died at 3:59 Wednesday afternoon after a gunman entered his Little Rock office and shot him several times in the upper body, Little Rock Police Lt. Terry Hastings said. Authorities confirmed the news shortly after former President Clinton and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton released a statement expressing their condolences. ""We are deeply saddened by the news that Bill Gwatney has passed away,"" the former governor and first lady of Arkansas said. ""His leadership and commitment to Arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him."" The shooting suspect, a white male in his fifties, also died Wednesday afternoon after a police chase ended in gunfire, Hastings said. Authorities are working to confirm his identity, but Hastings said there was no indication that he was a former employee. He said police were investigating possible motives, as well as why the suspect went into the Arkansas Baptist State Convention brandishing a gun. CNN affilliates KARK and KTHV identified the gunman as Timothy Dale Johnson, 50, of Searcy, Arkansas. The suspect walked into the downtown headquarters, near the state Capitol building, before noon. The gunman said he was interested in volunteering, said Sam Higginbotham, a 17-year-old volunteer at the headquarters, The Associated Press reported. ""That was obviously a lie,"" Higginbotham said, the AP reported. The man asked for Gwatney and spoke with another employee before pushing his way into his office and pulling a gun on Gwatney, Hastings said. A woman in a nearby business told KTHV that Gwatney's assistant came in and asked her to call police.  Watch witnesses describe the incident » . ""I thought maybe someone had gotten hit by a car,"" said Sarah Lee, who works at a florist's shop. ""She was just shaking really bad."" But then the woman said that Gwatney had been shot and that three shots had been fired, Lee said. After the shooting, the suspect entered a nearby Arkansas Baptist State Convention and pointed a gun at an employee. The man was ""white as a sheet,"" convention official Dan Jordan said. ""I've heard he said something do to about losing a job. ... He didn't threaten anyone."" The man left through the front door shortly afterward, he said. A vehicle description was provided to police, Hastings said, and officers found it. A chase involving Little Rock police, Arkansas State Police and the Grant County Sheriff's Office ended about 20 miles south of Little Rock, where the suspect was shot and taken into custody, he said.  See a map of where the suspect was shot » . Police said the suspect drove into a ditch and around a set of spike strips in an attempt to evade police. Grant County authorities used a squad car to hit the suspect's vehicle from behind and ram it into another unit. The man then got out of his vehicle and began shooting at officers, who returned fire. In Sheridan, Arkansas, where the chase ended, a crowd gathered near the suspect's blue pickup as police cordoned off the area with yellow crime-scene tape. What appeared to be bullet holes could be seen in the truck's windshield. Police did not confirm Gwatney's identity until he died, but the Clintons released a statement earlier Wednesday that suggested Gwatney was involved. ""We are stunned and shaken by today's shooting at the Arkansas Democratic Party where our good friend and fellow Democrat Bill Gwatney was critically wounded,"" they said. ""Bill is not only a strong chairman of Arkansas' Democratic Party, but he is also a cherished friend and confidante. Our thoughts and prayers are with Bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery,"" they said. The Democratic National Committee also issued a statement Wednesday that identified Gwatney. ""This senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us,"" Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said in a written statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to Chairman Gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery.""

1938,"(CNN) -- Hundreds of residents ordered out of their homes as a massive wildfire advanced on the suburbs of Fort Collins, Colorado, may be allowed to return Wednesday evening, fire officials said. ""We're gaining,"" said Bill Hahnenberg, the U.S. Forest Service's commander for the team battling the High Park wildfire, which has burned 46,600 acres in northern Colorado. The fire, which has claimed at least one life, is estimated to be 10% contained. About 100 structures are confirmed lost, but hundreds of families are anxiously waiting to hear whether their homes survived. ""This fire's behavior is starting to diminish, at least in some places, where we can have trained individuals to go in and determine which structures are lost,"" Hahnenberg said during his Wednesday morning media briefing. Hundreds of firefighters have arrived from around the United States to help local departments that have been battling the fire, bringing to 1,000 the number of personnel involved in the fight. The local firefighters, some of whom have lost their own homes, are tired, Hahnenberg said. ""We're doing our best and have enough resources on board to rotate in and relieve them."" They've had ""some success, some failure"" in containing the advance of flames eastward and southward, toward residential areas, he said. Residents should be able to return to two evacuated neighborhoods later Wednesday and perhaps three areas Thursday, said Nick Christensen of the Larimer County Sheriff's Department. Mark Engle's family decided not to leave their Colorado home despite the thick smoke billowing through the air outside Tuesday. From a window, he watched deer grazing in his backyard, driven out of the forest by flames that have devoured thousands of acres of land only a few miles away. His children's backpacks were placed by the door, stuffed with their favorite toys. His family was packed and ready to leave in a hurry, Engle said. But they wanted to stay put, even though authorities have ordered residents in the area to clear out. ""There's a number of people like myself, (for whom) packing up and leaving when you have livestock and animals just isn't as easy as if you have just a house,"" Engle said. First measured at two acres early Saturday, the High Park Fire -- which officials say was caused by lightning -- has grown exponentially in the time since. President Barack Obama telephoned Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper on Tuesday and said his administration is already making personnel, equipment and federal grants available to the state to help in the effort. The huge plumes of smoke from the High Park fire are visible from miles away, casting a somber shadow even over communities well outside the danger zone. CNN iReporter Dave Thrush, a musician from Denver, posted dramatic pictures of smoke darkening the skies above the Colorado State University campus Sunday. ""The fire is 20 miles from the campus, so no one is in danger there, but the billowing smoke is still very eerie,"" he wrote. Another CNN iReporter, goodline69, a restaurant server in Lafayette, Colorado, told CNN on Monday: ""It was a beautiful day in Fort Collins with business as usual for many, it seemed, so it was a bit surreal to be watching homes being destroyed from across the reservoir. ""I found myself watching the crowd watch the fire. Heartbreaking."" Are wildfires near you?

1939,"(CNN) -- Peru's health ministry is asking people to avoid beaches in Lima and north of the capital until officials can determine what caused the deaths of hundreds of dolphins and pelicans. Last month, the country's production ministry said the authorities were investigating the deaths of more than 538 pelicans, and other birds, on the northern coast. State-run TV Peru estimated that as many as to 1,200 birds have been found dead along the 100 miles (160km) of northern shoreline extending from Punta Negra, in Piura, to San JosÃ©, in the state of Lambayeque. That discovery came after close to 900 dolphins washed up dead on the northern coast of Peru this year. The investigation into the deaths of both the dolphins and the birds is ongoing, and it is not clear whether they are connected. The health ministry advised anyone who might handle any of the dead birds to wear protective clothing, such as gloves and masks. Peruvian Deputy Environment Minister Gabriel Quijandria told CNN last month the dolphins may have died from an outbreak of Morbillivirus or Brucella bacteria. Morbillivirus is a class of viruses that are part of the same family as human measles; Brucella bacteria are the cause of many serious diseases in animals. Officials have said the dolphins' deaths were not due to lack of food, interaction with fisheries, poisoning with pesticides, biotoxin poisoning or contamination by heavy metals. ""When you have something this large, my gut would tell me that there's something traumatic that happened,"" Sue Rocca, a marine biologist with the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, told CNN last month. She raised a number of possibilities as to what could have killed the animals, including acoustic trauma. Preliminary reports ruled out the possibility that seismic sound waves created by oil exploration in the area could have killed the birds, the environment ministry has said. Bird flu has also been ruled out.","The health ministry asks people to avoid beaches in Lima and north of the capital .

1940,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The 2005 London bombings on three subway trains and a bus, which killed 52 people, could not have been prevented, according to an official report into the attacks released Tuesday. The wreck of a bus destroyed by a bomb in central London on July 7, 2005. Police and intelligence services did all they could to trace suspects and avert attacks given the resources, intelligence and evidence they had at the time, said the report by the Intelligence and Security Committee, which reports directly to the prime minister. ""It is a very shocking fact, and it's one we have to live with,"" said Kim Howells, a lawmaker who chairs the committee. Some 700 people were wounded in the bombings on July 7, 2005. All four bombers died in the blasts. The finding contradicts portions of the committee's 2006 report into the bombings, which said the chances of preventing the attacks could have been increased. Having additional resources in place might have alerted law enforcement agencies to the intentions of the July 7 bombers, the 2006 report said.  Watch what the new inquiry concludes » . But the report released Tuesday said it would have been impossible to trace every person connected to the plot. ""If you want complete coverage, you're going to have to have hundreds of thousands -- literally -- of security and intelligence officers, and that's not the society we live in,"" Howells said at a news conference. ""I'm afraid that it is an extremely uncomfortable fact."" Law enforcement agencies could not have simply shifted resources to cover areas that needed attention, the committee said, because other operations were deemed more urgent at the time and officers had to make ""hard choices"" about the suspects and leads it wanted to pursue. ""Hindsight is a wonderful thing,"" said committee member Michael Mates. ""Having gone into all the details, we can't find any reason to criticize the judgment they took at that time."" He added, ""I wish we could say it won't happen again, but we can't."" Resources are only part of the problem, the committee said. ""It is not simply a case of 'throwing money at the problem' -- MI5 operates under legal constraints, too,"" the report said. MI5 is Britain's domestic intelligence agency. ""MI5 must have good reason to investigate an individual before they are permitted to use intrusive techniques -- the law is designed to protect an individual's right to privacy."" Under the law, there was no reason for police to have followed some of the people now deemed to have been involved in the attacks. Surveillance or further investigation simply wasn't justified in the months before the attacks, said committee member George Howarth. ""With hindsight, we are now able to consider past events, connect them and understand what might have been happening. But this is only with the benefit of hindsight,"" the report said. Police coverage is now better than it was, Mates said, and he praised the British government for spending more on law enforcement and the security agencies for recruiting more staff. The committee did, however, criticize the communication between police and security services, just as the previous report did. It also criticized the record-keeping of MI5. It is the panel's most comprehensive report yet into the 2005 attacks. The committee looked at every detail that police and intelligence agents knew, including recordings, photographs, and records. It aimed to deliver a more complete report than the one issued in 2006, Howells said. The final result took more than 14 months to produce and ran to more than 100 pages. ""We appreciate that everyone wants to be reassured that there will never be another 7/7. Such an absolute assurance cannot be given,"" the report says. ""What our agencies can do is to build an intelligence network that gives them as much information as possible and then try and stop those that it comes across -- which is what they have been doing. But we must be realistic. Despite the increased efforts of the agencies, and the increased resources at their disposal, the odds are stacked against them.""","Report: Police and intelligence services did all they could to trace suspects .

1941,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A decision on if researchers can study Junior Seau's brain for clues to the NFL veteran's suicide will wait until his family meets with elders from their Samoan culture, his family said Monday. Seau, 43, died of a gunshot wound at his Oceanside, California, home wound last week in what the coroner concluded was a suicide. There has been speculation about whether repeated hits to his head over his 20-year pro football career could have been a contributing factor. Seau's parents, who are from the island of Aunu'u, American Samoa, were meeting Monday with Samoan elders, according to Shawn Mitchell, who was Seau's pastor. ""The Seau family is currently revisiting several important family decisions and placing them on hold in order to confer with their elders,"" a family statement said. ""All possibilities are being considered, but none will be acted upon until the Seaus arrive at an agreed upon direction."" While there was no evidence Seau suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative disease brought on by multiple concussions, friends and family have stepped forward to say the legendary linebacker suffered a number of hits to the head during his career. Researchers have contacted the Seau family to request the opportunity to study his brain, Mitchell said last week. While Mitchell did not identify the researchers making the requests, among the institutions the family could donate Seau's brain to is Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, the research center that found former Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson suffered degenerative damage to his brain because of repeated hits. Duerson committed suicide, shooting himself in the chest in 2011 and leaving a suicide note that said he wanted his brain studied for possible damage. While Seau left no such note, he did aim the handgun at his chest. ""Him taking the shot to the chest makes sense that he would want his head examined,"" Mitchell said. As a linebacker, Seau played ""the most havoc-ridden position on the team. He suffered many concussions, so there is a strong sense that it played a role,"" said Mitchell, who is also the chaplain for the San Diego Chargers, the team for which Seau played 13 seasons. Seau's death follows last month's suicide of former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling, the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit against the NFL over concussion-related injuries. The lawsuit names more than 1,000 professional players. Both Easterling and Duerson exhibited symptoms of repetitive head trauma: memory lapses, anger and deep depression, according to family and friends. And in both cases, researchers found signs of brain trauma. The NFL has repeatedly dismissed the lawsuit's allegations that the league concealed links between football and brain injuries, saying player safety is a priority. ""Any allegation that the NFL intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit,"" it said. Seau does not appear to have participated in any of the pending lawsuits against the NFL. CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, warned against drawing a conclusion in Seau's case, though he said there are striking similarities between his death and other cases involving football players. The only way to determine if Seau suffered CTE is to analyze the brain tissue for ""hallmarks of the dementia-like disease,"" Gupta said. ""We can't know,"" unless Seau's brain is analyzed in this way, whether his death was related to CTE, he said.","A decision on a brain study is ""on hold"" while Seau's family consults Samoan cultural elders .

1942,"(CNN) -- Military investigators said Monday that they do not suspect foul play in the death of an Army captain who collapsed during a video call with his wife. Capt. Bruce Kevin Clark, 43, was using the video calling service Skype to speak with his wife, Susan Orellana-Clark, on April 30 when he slumped forward. He was dead when military personnel arrived two hours later. Orellana-Clark said Sunday in a statement that she saw what appeared to be a bullet hole on the wall behind her husband after he collapsed, leading to speculation he had been shot. While the cause of death is not known, investigators have ruled out a gunshot, Army Criminal Investigation Command spokesman Chris Grey said in a statement. ""Agents conducting the investigation, found no trauma to the body beyond minor abrasions and a possible broken nose most likely caused from Captain Clark striking his face on his desk when he collapsed,"" Grey said. ""Although we have not completely ruled it out to ensure a complete and thorough investigation is conducted, we do not suspect foul play in the death of Captain Clark at this point in our ongoing investigation,"" he said. In a statement Sunday, Orellana-Clark said that her husband seemed to be in no distress when he was ""knocked forward,"" revealing what she said appeared to be a bullet hole in the closet door behind him. Orellana-Clark said she was releasing the details ""to honor my husband and dispel the inaccurate information and supposition promulgated by other parties."" Two U.S. military officials with knowledge of the investigation conducted in Afghanistan confirmed that it took two hours from the time Clark collapsed while on Skype with his wife until military personnel arrived. They said Orellana-Clark's request had been routed through several commands in the United States before it was relayed to Afghanistan. No wounds were found on Clark's body, according to one of the officials, who said the death has been determined to be ""noncombat"" and suicide has been ruled out. An official determination of cause of death is pending autopsy and toxicology results, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case is still under investigation. Clark, who was a chief nurse, was assigned to the William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, but deployed with a medical unit from Fort Hood. He was stationed at Tarin Kowt, about 85 miles (140 kilometers) north of Kandahar. In addition to his wife, Clark is survived by two daughters. CNN's Chelsea J.

1944,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An extensive federal report released Monday concludes that roughly one in four of the 697,000 U.S. veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War suffer from Gulf War illness. A U.S. soldier wears protection against chemical weapons during the Gulf War in a February 1991 photo. That illness is a condition now identified as the likely consequence of exposure to toxic chemicals, including pesticides and a drug administered to protect troops against nerve gas. The 452-page report states that ""scientific evidence leaves no question that Gulf War illness is a real condition with real causes and serious consequences for affected veterans."" The report, compiled by a panel of scientific experts and veterans serving on the congressionally mandated Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, fails to identify any cure for the malady. It also notes that few veterans afflicted with Gulf War illness have recovered over time. ""Today's report brings to a close one of the darkest chapters in the legacy of the 1991 Gulf War,"" said Anthony Hardie, a member of the committee and a member of the advocacy group Veterans of Modern Warfare. ""This is a bittersweet victory, [because] this is what Gulf War veterans have been saying all along,"" Hardie said at a news conference in Washington. ""Years were squandered by the federal government ... trying to disprove that anything could be wrong with Gulf War veterans."" The committee's report, titled ""Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans,"" was officially presented Monday to Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake. Noting that overall funding for research into Gulf War illness has declined dramatically since 2001, it calls for a ""renewed federal research commitment"" to ""identify effective treatments for Gulf War illness and address other priority Gulf War health issues.""  Watch CNN's Elizabeth Cohen report more on Gulf War illness » . According to the report, Gulf War illness is a ""complex of multiple concurrent symptoms"" that ""typically includes persistent memory and concentration problems, chronic headaches, widespread pain, gastrointestinal problems, and other chronic abnormalities."" The illness may also be potentially tied to higher rates of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) -- more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease -- among Gulf War veterans than veterans of other conflicts. The illness is identified as the consequence of multiple ""biological alterations"" affecting the brain and nervous system. iReport.com: Do you know someone affected by Gulf War illness? While it is sometimes difficult to issue a specific diagnosis of the disease, it is, according to the report, no longer difficult to identify a cause. The report identifies two Gulf War ""neurotoxic"" exposures that ""are causally associated with Gulf War illness."" The first is the ingestion of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) pills, given to protect troops from effects of nerve agents. The second is exposure to dangerous pesticides used during the conflict. The report does not rule out other possible contributors to Gulf War illness -- including low-level exposure to nerve agents and close proximity to oil well fires -- though it fails to establish any clear link. The report concludes there is no clear link between the illness and a veteran's exposure to factors such as depleted uranium or an anthrax vaccine administered at the time. ""Gulf War illness isn't some imaginary syndrome,"" said Ken Robinson, the senior intelligence officer for the initial Department of Defense investigation into Gulf War illness in 1996-97. ""This is real, and it has devastated families. Now is the time to restore the funding cuts that have been made in the Veterans Administration. Our mission has to be to ensure that these veterans get help and become whole again."" Robinson noted that soldiers in the field today are not at risk for Gulf War illness, because the military is no longer using the PB pills or pesticides that led to the illness in 1990 and 1991. The report backs Robinson's conclusion, noting that no problem similar to Gulf War illness has been discovered among veterans from the conflict in Bosnia in the 1990s or in the current engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq. The committee report also backs Robinson's call for more effective treatments among veterans suffering from Gulf War illness. Noting that overall funding for research into Gulf War illness has declined dramatically since 2001, it calls for a ""renewed federal research commitment"" to ""identify effective treatments for Gulf War illness and address other priority Gulf War health issues."" Specifically, the report calls for at least $60 million in new annual federal funding on research committed to improving the health of Gulf War veterans.","NEW: Officer who investigated illness: ""This is real, and it has devastated families""

1945,"(CNN) -- Meeting planner Gail Murphy heard about the travel warning to Mexico too late in the day on Monday to do anything about her plans to head to Cancun the following day. Alberto Morales wore a mask on his flight from Mexico City to Denver, Colorado, on Monday. ""I'm in good health,"" said Murphy, who is heading to the Eighth Annual Mexico Showcase and Travel Expo from her home in Shelburne, Vermont. ""I'm a risk taker, so I'll go anyway."" In light of the swine flu, the U.S. State Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning against any non-essential travel to Mexico. The move could potentially devastate an already struggling tourism industry in the country. The World Health Organization urged countries not to restrict international travel or close borders, as such measures would not in themselves stem the outbreak. Efforts to contain the outbreak by restricting travel would be unlikely to work without ""draconian measures,"" said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the agency's assistant director-general. But he said people who are ill should put off trips abroad, and people who fall ill after a trip should see a doctor. Mexico is the epicenter for the swine influenza virus outbreak. More than 100 deaths in Mexico are being investigated as possibly tied to the outbreak. The WHO confirmed 73 cases of swine flu Monday, but health officials in Scotland, California and Texas confirmed nine more, bringing the worldwide total to 82. Reports of the illness in Mexico couldn't have come at a worse time for the country's tourism industry, which is already grappling with negative publicity about drug-cartel fueled violence. ""They were having a terrible time anyway with all of the problems on the border and now to be hit with this, too,"" said Barbara Nassau, owner of New York-based In House Travel Solutions. She added that the outbreak has the potential to hamper travel similar to the way it was affected when bird flu hit China. iReporter Dyana Pari Nafissi works in international business development in Mexico City and said tourism in the country had already been dealt a blow by fears of violence. iReport.com: Watch Dyana discuss what's happening in Mexico . ""We've been on a steady decline since the first U.S. travel warning about the drug cartels,"" she said. ""When you look at the kids that braved [that travel warning], and now they are back [in the U.S.] and they are sick. It's devastating to the economy here."" Some of the confirmed cases in the United States were high school students who recently returned from a trip to Mexico. News of the outbreak didn't seem to overly concern travelers arriving Monday at Denver International Airport on a Mexicana flight from Mexico City. Two Mexicana crew members who didn't want to be named said about 60 percent of the passengers wore masks during the flight. Ernesto Vargas, a Mexican businessman, didn't wear a mask. ""I thought about carrying one with me, but the crew wasn't wearing a mask. So we asked them, and it seemed quite safe."" Alberto Morales, another businessman, said he wore a mask in the Mexico City airport and on the plane. ""Yes. I have a mask, and we are using the mask."" Is he concerned? ""Don't worry, I am OK,"" he said with a laugh. ""People are afraid about the flu, but we have many precautions and the government has a good sense for this trouble,"" Morales said. Ian Jeffries, a spokesman for Expedia.com, said the company had no data as of Monday on cancellations or changes caused by fear of swine flu, but added that it was prepared to aid any of its customers that had concerns. ""Expedia is currently offering to waive Expedia-imposed change and cancel fees for hotel and air reservations originally booked to Mexico,"" he said. ""We will continue to monitor the situation and modify our policy accordingly."" Several major U.S. airlines also are waiving fees for those who want to change their travel plans to Mexico. Jeffery Brown arrived at the airport in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday after spending five days in Cancun with his wife. They saw people in surgical masks but didn't notice any widespread concern. ""My wife and I were a little concerned, but you know we haven't seen anybody sick in our resort, and we haven't seen anybody sick at the airport,"" he said. ""Nobody said a word about it [at the resort]."" Mexico isn't the only country that potentially has a tourism headache on its hands. Cases of swine flu have also popped up in Canada and Spain as well as the United States and Scotland.  Watch how businesses might be affected by swine flu » . Steve Weakland, border security coordinator for the United States Customs and Border Protection  Atlanta field office, said all of his personnel have received illness recognition training. If a traveler exhibits symptoms of the disease, CBP employees have been trained to inform the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further investigate. ""Our guys are more the recognition aspect of it,"" Weakland said. ""We wouldn't make any diagnosis or anything along those lines."" Teresa Roberts planned to take her mom to Akumal, Mexico, for Mother's Day and said she was more worried about traveling to New York for business than she is about contracting swine flu south of the border. ""Just because of the number of different travelers that go through the airports in New York from all around the world,"" said Roberts who flies about two or three weeks a month  from her home in Atlanta, Georgia. ""I'm not nervous about going to Mexico at all."" Many in the tourism industry appeared to be taking a wait-and-see approach. Disney Cruise Lines, which does not sail into Mexico, said it is closely monitoring the situation, as did officials for theme parks including Universal and Sea World in Orlando, Florida. Meg Barton travels several times a year to Mexico from her home in Round Rock, Texas, and also isn't overly worried. Because of her father's recent heart surgery, she is already an avid hand washer and is always cautious about germs when abroad. ""I don't drink a lot of water in Mexico ever, and I am really more concerned about the drug issues in Mexico than I am the swine flue,"" Barton said. ""We take antibiotics and Pepto with us when we travel."" Eric Meyer of Lafayette, Colorado, flew in to Minneapolis-St. Paul with his wife and baby to visit family in Minnesota and lamented that ""It's out there, but what can you do?"" ""Wash your hands maybe and call it good,"" he added. ""Put a mask on? [I'm] not gonna go that far and be that guy yet."" Rochelle Yates said a client of her New York City-based Yates Travel is planning to take plenty of antiseptic products on an upcoming trip to Cancun. Most seasoned travelers know to guard against infectious disease ordinarily, Yates said. ""My clients are people who travel all over the world, and they know that you have to take precautions regardless,"" Yates said. ""You have to wash your hands no matter where you are, if you are on a cruise ship, in a hotel or even in your own house.""

1946,"Washington (CNN) -- Hoping to eliminate a problem before it spreads rather than fighting an outbreak once it's discovered, the USDA announced Wednesday a new tracing method it hopes will protect consumers from eating contaminated meat and poultry. The new strategy changes how meat and poultry processors and the U.S. Department of Agriculture trace E. coli contaminated food in the U.S. food chain. According to the USDA, if food safety inspectors find E. coli during routine sampling, they will now move quickly to identify the supplier and target removing the tainted product from store shelves. CNN.com Health library: What is E. coli? Additionally, new regulations require meat and poultry processors, farmers and retail establishments to have recall plans in place, notify federal officials within 24 hours if a contaminated product is found and requires better documentation of how they controlled the hazardous meat. According to data on the Centers for Disease Control's website, multistate outbreaks of foodborne illnesses are reported about four to six times a year on average in the United States. Currently, officials are fighting an outbreak of salmonella from contaminated tuna that has been reported in 24 states and Washington. According to the CDC, 258 people have been infected nationwide. Yellowfin tuna tied to salmonella outbreak . The FDA says better tracing will help government officials collaboratively find contamination sources before outbreaks start. According to the CDC, around 48 million people, or one in six Americans get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die each year from foodborne diseases.","USDA announces a new tracing method for contaminated meat, poultry .

1947,"(CNN) -- Firefighters in northern Colorado face another round of nightmare conditions on Monday as high temperatures, low relative humidity and gusty winds whip a blaze near Fort Collins. The High Park Fire has consumed more than 56,000 acres so far, fire authorities said. It is about 45% contained. More than 1,700 personnel were battling the blaze. ""It just feels really dire. It's scary,"" resident Lupe Sandoval told CNN affiliate KUSA TV. ""You feel bad for everybody."" The National Weather Service rates the fire risk in six Western states on Monday as ""critical."" Red flag warnings are posted across 10 states, warning of high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures. The High Park Fire is west of Fort Collins, has destroyed at least 181 homes, according to a statement posted on InciWeb, a U.S. multiagency fire response website. ""The assessment is still under way and this number will continue to grow,"" the statement said. The blaze has moved through forests and neighborhoods, forcing thousands of evacuations and leaving a trail of destruction. It has claimed one life, a 62-year-old woman found dead in her burned home last week. ""It will be some time before this fire is out, but our challenge now is to make sure we do everything to contain the damage,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who oversees the Forest Service and toured the Colorado blaze. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said a tree struck by lightning more than a week ago sparked the mammoth blaze in his state. Elsewhere in Colorado, firefighters are battling an 11,988-acre fire near Pagosa Springs that broke out last month. That blaze is 30% contained. Meanwhile Sunday, a new fire broke out and quickly spread to 200 acres near Pueblo, forcing some evacuations of residents. In New Mexico, the Whitewater Baldy complex has scorched more than 296,000 acres, the agriculture secretary said. More than 3,200 fire personnel from across the United States are helping local departments battle the fire that began on May 16. The blaze was 80% contained as of Sunday.

1949,"(CNN) -- A group of masked gunmen stormed a popular bar in the Mexican city of Chihuahua late Friday, killing 15 people, including two journalists, state prosecutors said Saturday. At least 10 suspects entered the Colorado Bar wearing what looked like police uniforms and opened fire on the crowd inside the bar, according to Carlos Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. Eleven people died at the scene, and the other four died en route to the hospital. The victims ranged in age between 25 and 72. Among them was Hector Javier Aguirre Salinas, the owner of a news website and a respected journalist. A second journalist, Francisco Javier Moya -- who in years past had served as the news director for a radio station in Ciudad Juarez -- also was killed. ""The crime of our partners and the rest of those killed in the attack, cannot go unpunished,"" Roberto Delgado, president of the Association of Journalists in Juarez, said in a statement on the killings. Prosecutors said they collected at least 30 shell casings from a variety of weapons, including several bullet casings from an AK-47. Northern Mexico has been ravaged by battles among rival drug cartels, police and government troops for the past several years. More than 47,000 people have been killed since the Mexican government launched a crackdown on drug traffickers in December 2006, according to government statistics. Journalist Arturo Chacon contributed to this report for CNN.","Prosecutors said at least 10 gunmen stormed the Chihuahua bar Friday night .

1950,"(CNN) -- Firefighters on Friday battled a massive wildfire that has so far claimed more than 100 homes in northern Colorado. The High Park Fire has scorched more than 52,000 acres, forced thousands of people to flee and claimed at least one life. The blaze was 15% contained Friday, up from 10% on Wednesday. Nick Christensen, an executive officer with the Larimer County Sheriff's Office, said Friday that 112 homes have been destroyed. Many burned days ago, but authorities are just starting to get into the affected areas to assess the damage, he said. That figure is expected to rise. ""It's really not just a list of numbers; these are stories. Each one of these represents a family that's been displaced from their home -- that may have lost some family heirlooms, some photos, possessions, kids' toys,"" Christensen said. ""It's really devastating and sad."" At least one of the homes belonged to a Larimer County Sheriff's Office employee, he said. First measured at two acres early last Saturday, the High Park Fire -- which officials say was caused by lightning -- has since grown exponentially. It is about 15 miles west of Fort Collins, Colorado. Hundreds of firefighters have arrived from across the United States to help local departments. Besides the main blaze, they are also battling a 200-acre spot fire, which broke out just north of the burn area. Helicopters flew back and forth Friday, dousing the flames with water. Complicating firefighters' efforts was a thunderstorm, which brought little rain, but kicked up strong winds, said Brett Haberstick, an incident command spokesman. ""The higher humidities definitely help. It reduces the opportunity for fire to spread. The wind, however, is not a good opportunity,"" he said. Incident meteorologist Dave Lipson forecast a similar thunderstorm Saturday. Sunday should be calm, but Monday and Tuesday could bring gusts of up to 50 miles per hour on exposed ridges, he said.","The fire has scorched more than 52,000 acres west of Fort Collins, Colorado .

1952,"Washington (CNN) -- For several fear-filled minutes last Friday, three passengers on board American Airlines flight 2332 in Dallas called emergency dispatchers to report a flight attendant's apparent meltdown, asking for help and trying to make sense of her strange rant. The flight, which was on the ground, never took off, and no passengers were hurt. But the 911 calls, released Tuesday, show the mutual confusion of the callers and the 911 dispatchers as they tried to piece together information, which was sparse on both sides of the phone line. ""We're on flight 2332 and, um, they're talking over the radio about crashing our plane,"" the first caller, a woman, told the emergency dispatcher. ""OK, who is talking about crashing your plane?"" the dispatcher asked. ""The attendants, over the PA,"" the caller said. ""Please help us."" Obviously perplexed, and wanting to confirm the bizarre report, the dispatcher repeated the information. ""You're currently on board the flight, and the attendants are announcing over the PA system..."" ""Yes,"" the caller interjected. ""...that they're going to crash the plane?"" the dispatcher asked. ""Yes,"" the caller said. ""Did they say why?"" ""No,"" the caller answered. The dispatcher implored the caller not to hang up, asked for her name and phone number, and asked precisely what the flight attendant said. ""Her specific words were, 'This plane is not going to take off before it crashes,'"" the passenger said. A second female passenger called, and the dispatcher told her help was on the way. ""Listen, we've got people that are coming to you. I need you to give me some information so you can help me fill them in, OK?"" the dispatcher said. ""(You are) going to be OK. As long as that plane doesn't take off, you are still fine. You are still on the ground, right?"" The passenger confirmed the plane was still on the ground and said a passenger in the back of the plane had just gone up front. ""OK, don't be alarmed. He may be a sky marshal,"" the dispatcher said. ""They fly armed and they are in plainclothes. So don't be alarmed."" The man, it was later learned, was another passenger who helped detain the flight attendant. The third 911 caller, a man, asked ""Are you all aware of what's going on on flight 2332 right now?"" ""It looks like they're physically restraining a flight attendant,"" he said. ""She's lost it. People are helping out."" Finally, another call came from the airport control tower, saying the matter was nearing a resolution. ""Flight 2332 returning to the gate. Altercation on board. Fight being reported,"" the control tower official reported. Friday morning's event at Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport was a rare disruption blamed on a flight attendant, but did not appear to involve any criminal intent. Local and federal officials said they had not filed charges against the airline employee, adding to speculation she had suffered a mental breakdown. One passenger later told CNN the flight attendant appeared confused even before the flight pulled away from the gate. The passenger said she overheard the flight attendant say she was bipolar and had not taken her medication. As the plane taxied towards the runway, the flight attendant made references to needing to perform ""cross-checks,"" and then appeared to be attempting to reach the pilots. Unable to reach the pilots, she announced on the plane's public address system that she was no longer responsible for the safety of the aircraft and that it might crash. Fellow crew members scuffled with the woman for control of the microphone, and passengers moved in to restrain her. The flight attendant and a colleague were taken to a hospital for treatment, American Airlines said.","Flight attendant reportedly suffered mental breakdown on American Airlines flight .

1953,"(CNN) -- Rescuers combed through mangled wreckage early Sunday searching for survivors after two passenger trains collided in southern Poland, leaving at least 16 dead. An American citizen was among the dead, said a spokesman with the U.S. Consulate in Krakow. In addition to the fatalities, the collision Saturday night injured at least 60 others, according to the Polish State Fire Brigade. Authorities are ""almost sure there will be no living persons inside the wreckage,"" said Marcin Kopczynski, the duty officer. ""We are using dogs to see if there are any living persons inside but no signs yet."" A firefighter described the rescue operation at the crash site in Szczekociny as complicated. ""The damage (to) the wagons is huge. We have contact with victims. We approach very cautiously,"" firefighter Jaroslaw Wojtasik told CNN's Polish affiliate TVN. More than 100 passengers who were not injured were evacuated to Warsaw, authorities said. CNN's Joyce Joseph contributed to this report.","NEW: A U.S. citizen is among the dead, consulate confirms .

1954,"London (CNN) -- The flare on a North Sea platform that has been leaking gas for nearly a week has extinguished itself, energy giant Total said Saturday. There had been fears the flare could ignite the escaping gas at the Elgin platform, about 150 miles (240 km) east of the Scottish city of Aberdeen, potentially causing a huge explosion. Total said it had received the first indication that the flare might be out at lunchtime on Friday. This was subsequently confirmed by a second surveillance flight later that afternoon, the company said in a statement. ""Our sea vessels on location reported no further flare activity through the night,"" it added Saturday. Total said Friday that it was ready to push ahead with two operations intended to stop the leak, following five days during which the site had remained stable. ""The first is to pump heavy mud directly into the well and the second is to drill relief wells to intervene at the source of the gas flow,"" Total said. The firm is ""mobilizing all means to allow these options to be implemented,"" it said. Total has two drilling rigs in the area which will be used to drill the relief wells, it said. The company, which is still investigating the cause of the leak, estimates that 200,000 cubic meters of gas a day are escaping. ""The gas cloud is fairly small in size and prevailing winds are blowing it away from the platform and dispersing it,"" Total said. ""An exclusion zone around the platform has been set up by the UK authorities taking into account a wide safety margin."" Scottish Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said Friday he had stressed the need for ""absolute transparency"" from Total and the British government with regards to the situation. While the current environmental risk ""continues to be minimal,"" he said, the authorities will continue to be vigilant. Nearly 240 workers were taken off the rig as the problem developed Sunday. Two nearby rigs were also partially evacuated by Shell. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","The flare on a North Sea platform that has been leaking gas has gone out, Total says .

1955,"(CNN) -- In addition to a disastrous drought and political violence, Somalia is facing a potentially devastating health crisis. The World Health Organization's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean said that at one hospital alone, more than 6,000 cases of cholera and diarrhea have been reported since January of this year. Banadir Hospital in Mogadishu is one of Somalia's largest, but its website warns that it has been ""flooded"" with recent cases of acute watery diarrhea, or AWD, a condition associated with cholera and unclean drinking water leading to malnutrition and fatal dehydration. CNN video taken Thursday at a Banadir Hospital's pediatric diarrhea center shows heart-wrenching images of emaciated babies and their worried parents. Many of the infants were receiving fluids through intravenous drips. A flyer distributed by the center emphasizes the importance of hydration, and encourages mothers to breastfeed as much as possible. But even with intensive hydration and medical care, many will not survive. In just the past week, four children under the age of 5 have died at Banadir Hospital, health agencies say. More than 190 other children were hospitalized there in the same period, along with nearly 100 adults. But it is children who bear the brunt of this condition: This year, 45% of AWD-related deaths have been among children under 2 years old, according to World Health Organization statistics. The organization has been building up its supplies and working on preventive activities in reaction to the ongoing conflict near Mogadishu, Somalia's capital. Its most recent statement warns that ""the increased influx of internal displaced people and the precarious living conditions are high risk for outbreaks, and the number of AWD cases is expected to rise significantly between now and October.""","One Somalia hospital has treated more than 6,000 cases of cholera and diarrhea this year .

1956,"(CNN) -- An accident in a tunnel at a construction project near Lake Mead in the Las Vegas area killed one worker and injured another on Monday, the agency operating the site said. The workers were constructing a mining operation underground when they were hit by a high-pressure release of grout, said Bronson Mack of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, a cooperative public agency formed in 1991 to manage the water resources in a region that includes Las Vegas. One worker suffered a fatal blow from the impact of the pressure release and died on the scene, Mack said. The other worker was taken to a hospital with unspecified injuries. No other workers remain in the tunnel at this time, according to Mack, and no one was exposed to harmful gases as a result of the accident. The fatal pressure release took place at a project known as Intake No. 3, which is under way near Lake Mead. The project is intended to give the authorities the ability to draw water from the Colorado River for the Las Vegas area and guard against water quality issues that are associated with continually dropping lake levels. The area is in the midst of moderate to severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. The regional agency has undertaken a $2.9 billion capital improvement initiative, stretched out over 15 years, to address the region's water needs.","A high-pressure release of grout strikes two workers at a construction site .

1957,"Tegucigalpa, Honduras (CNN) -- At least 13 people died Thursday in a fire at a prison in northern Honduras, a fire official said. Among the dead was a prisoner who was decapitated, a fire official told reporters. Video shot at the scene showed thick clouds of smoke billowing from the building. The incident comes on the heels of another prison fire in Honduras that killed more than 350 people last month. The cause of the fire at the prison in San Pedro Sula was not immediately known. Police Chief Ricardo Ramirez said shots had been heard from inside. A fire last month in the central Honduran town of Comayagua killed 358 inmates. Two previous deadly prison fires have occurred in San Pedro Sula. In 2009, 103 people were reported killed and in 2004, 107 died. Honduran prisons have been criticized for being overcrowded places with poor conditions.

1958,"(CNN) -- One year ago, the world watched as a massive tsunami engulfed entire communities in northern Japan. Live television footage showed waves as high as 30 feet rushing into coastal cities, tossing around boats, cars and rooftops just an hour after one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded. ""I thought Japan would disappear,"" one elderly survivor said in the immediate aftermath. ""I thought Japan would disappear under water."" Earthquakes are not uncommon for Japan, which rests on one of the world's most active fault lines. But the one that triggered the tsunami on March 11, 2011, had a magnitude of 9.0, making it the fourth-largest earthquake in the world since 1900. ""My wife and I stood outside and basically held on to the outside of our house,"" resident Matt Alt said on the day of the quake. ""We couldn't even stand up. We have never ever felt anything on the magnitude of what we experienced today."" The videos from last year's disaster are still astonishing today. One shows a man trapped in rushing waters, desperately clinging to a telephone wire. Another shows people running away from the tsunami, barely escaping before a wall of water barrels into their homes. Many other people, however, were not so lucky. As of Friday, the official death toll was 15,854. An additional 3,167 people are still missing. The total damage from the disaster has been estimated at about 25 trillion yen, or $300 billion. ""The house you're seeing here wasn't here before,"" one man said, showing his neighborhood's damage a week after the tsunami. ""It was swept here by the wave. The houses that were here were completely washed away."" With the popularity of mobile phones in Japan, last year's tsunami was one of the most recorded natural disasters in history. Amateur videos surfaced quickly, making it easier than ever for people around the world to empathize with the victims, said Tokyo-based technology consultant Steve Nagata. ""Because you had all of this very real footage, it made the incident much more real in people's minds,"" Nagata recently told CNN's Kyung Lah. ""They no longer have to imagine what a tsunami is. They saw it live. ... To be able to do this in near real time and to do it to audiences across the globe is unprecedented."" Many people lost their homes in the tsunami but were fortunate to find shelter at nearby evacuation centers. In Ishinomaki, Japan, evacuees used old boxes to set up ""cardboard cities"" while they waited for temporary housing to be built. One of those evacuees, Yoshichi Suzuki, had a positive outlook as he stayed with his grandchildren at the shelter. Two months after the tsunami, Suzuki was nursing several plants that he had salvaged from his damaged home. ""They were washed away by the tsunami but still survived,"" he told Lah. ""And they're blooming with flowers now. ""Just like the plants, we must go on and live.""

1959,"(CNN) -- A body discovered at Churchill Downs on Sunday, a day after the storied Louisville racetrack hosted the Kentucky Derby, may have been the victim of a homicide, police said. Workers in the barn area discovered the body early in the morning and notified track security, which called police, said Robert Biven, a spokesman for the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department. ""We just got the call just prior to 5 a.m. to respond to the backside"" of the racetrack, Biven told CNN. Police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley said police suspect foul play. The body, which has not been identified, appears to be a Latino man in his 30s or 40s, Biven said. About 400 people were located Saturday night in the rear of the racetrack, he said. ""So we are trying to speak with as many people as we possibly can,"" he said. ""We do have a few leads coming in."" An autopsy is to be carried out Monday morning. Biven described the track's backside as ""like a mini city,"" with 48 barns, workers' dormitories and areas where trainers live. ""It's a 24-hour operation,"" he said.

1960,"Newark, New Jersey (CNN) -- To the family of Zina Hodge, the man who dashed into their burning home and pulled their loved one to safety through intense heat, falling embers and dense smoke could just be Superman. But Newark Mayor Cory Booker most definitely did not feel like the Man of Steel on Friday as he recovered from smoke inhalation and second-degree burns suffered during the rescue of his 47-year-old neighbor the previous night. ""I did not feel too heroic,"" Booker told reporters. ""It all happened very, very quickly and I just feel very blessed that she and I got out of the building alive."" Booker, 42, has fostered a reputation as a hands-on mayor of sorts, once spotted shoveling city streets during a 2010 blizzard and using his Twitter feed to coordinate snow plows and the delivery of supplies. His latest feat for his constituents went viral Friday as news of the rescue spread and social media users quickly dubbed him ""Super Mayor."" A new Tumblr blog named SuperCoryBooker was thrown together Friday with tongue-in-cheek memes about the mayor's knack for getting things done. ""Just another day, saving Newark,"" read one. For his part, Booker was quick to cast off the ""superhero"" title. ""I think that's way over the top,"" he said outside his home. ""There are people who do this every day,"" referring to police officers, firefighters and other first-responders. ""I'm a neighbor that did what most neighbors would do, which is to jump into action to help a friend,"" Booker said. The incident began around 9:30 p.m. Thursday as Booker was en route to his Newark residence. Two members of his security detail -- already waiting outside for the mayor -- noticed flames coming out of a second-story window of the neighbor's home and called fire dispatch before banging on the door to alert the home's occupants. The security officers, Detectives Alex Rodriguez and Santos Duran, managed to rescue three people by the time Booker arrived. ""As the last one was coming out, I was going up the stairs and she's screaming that her daughter is still in the building,"" Booker recalled. Flanked by the two detectives, Booker rushed toward the building, he said. ""Something exploded and sent a lot of flames over the steps, and my detail just grabbed me and started trying to drag me out of there,"" he said. Booker exchanged heated words with Rodriguez, who was pulling him by the belt to get him to safety. ""Look, this woman is going to die if we don't continue,"" Booker recalled saying. The detective relented and let him continue on. Once inside, Booker had what he described as his ""proverbial come-to-Jesus moment"" as he felt the intensity of the heat and had trouble finding Hodge. ""The reality is I didn't feel any courage. I felt fear,"" he said. ""I've never been so almost convinced that this was it. It was time to hope that I was going up and not down."" But just as he was ""praying, thinking, hoping,"" Hodge called out and Booker found her in a back room. Hoisting her, Booker ran through the flames, embers falling from the ceiling, and made his way outside before collapsing onto the sidewalk. ""Her mother gave me a hug I'll never forget for getting her out,"" he said. ""At that point, I felt this sense of gratitude. To go moments from thinking you're dead to kissing the Newark pavement ... I felt like I was delivered from the fires of hell."" Thursday's rescue marked Booker's latest foray into the media spotlight. The mayor has enjoyed a steady rise in national prominence as an outspoken advocate for urban issues since taking office in 2006. His efforts to turn around a city long struggling with high crime, chronic poverty and a restrictive budget are chronicled on the Sundance Channel's series ""Brick City."" His reputation also contrasts with that of several previous Newark mayors, a few of whom were convicted on corruption-related charges. Hodge is being treated at Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey, where she is in serious condition, officials said. Newark Fire Director Fateen Ziyad said the three other residents who were removed from the home ""are doing well."" ""It's like one in a million, the mayor to get your family out,"" said Robert Cooper, 20, who is Hodge's nephew. Still, Booker said his two detectives were ""the real heroes"" and sought to give Rodriguez and Duran most of the credit. As for his own super powers, Booker said the whole incident ""unfolded in a way that I think that angels helped to make it so.""

1962,"(CNN) -- Thousands of mourners descended on a suburban church in northern Italy on Thursday for the funeral of footballer Piermario Morosini, who died after collapsing on the pitch last week. Mourners lined the streets of Bergamo to see the 25-year-old Livorno player finally laid to rest in his hometown at the Church of San Gregorio. The midfielder's coffin was draped in his Livorno shirt as well as an Atalanta top bearing his name and the No. 8. Priest Luciano Manenti looked on as the coffin, adorned with wreaths and flowers, was carried from the church into a hearse. Morosini, who was on loan from Udinese, started out in Atalanta's youth team. Among the mourners were his longtime girlfriend Anna Vavassori, Italian soccer federation president Giancarlo Abete and national team coach Cesare Prandelli. ""Soccer must pose itself questions following this tragedy,"" Prandelli said after the funeral, according to Italian news agency Ansa. ""Sporting medicine and prevention are state of the art in Italy, but it's possible to improve."" Morosini's life had been blighted by tragedy with the loss of both his parents before his 18th birthday. His disabled brother later committed suicide, leaving him alone with his handicapped elder sister Maria Carla. The funeral followed a packed memorial ceremony at Livorno's Armando Picchi Stadium the previous day. Thousands of mourners filled the stands to pay tribute as a hearse carrying Morosini's coffin did a lap of the ground. Livorno's president Aldo Spinelli struggled to hold back tears as he saluted the player. Morosini died last Saturday after collapsing on the pitch during his side's Serie B game at Pescara. Initially it was thought Morosini had suffered a cardiac arrest but a post mortem on Monday proved inconclusive. The entire Italian football program that weekend was canceled and a minute's silence was observed at major league games around the world in his honor. Morosini's death has raised questions about the procedures in place at Italian stadiums to deal with an emergency of the type that cost him his life. Prosecutors are investigating whether a badly parked police car delayed the arrival of paramedics on the scene. Udinese has set up a fund for Maria Carla, who relied on her brother for financial support.","Thousands of mourners line streets of Morosini's hometown Bergamo for funeral .

1963,"(CNN) -- After the news of a U.S. soldier charged with murdering Afghan civilians, mostly women and children, the story of Spc. Dennis Weichel of the Rhode Island National Guard bears telling. The official Pentagon news release says he died ""from injuries suffered in a noncombat related incident."" But there is much more to the story. Weichel, 29, of Providence, died saving the life of a little girl. According to the Rhode Island National Guard and the U.S. Army, Weichel was in a convoy a week ago with his unit in Laghman Province, in northeast Afghanistan. Some children were in the road in front of the convoy, and Weichel and other troops got out to move them out of the way. Most of the children moved, but one little girl went back to pick up some brass shell casings in the road. Afghan civilians often recycle the casings, and the girl appeared to aim to do that. But a Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicle was moving toward her, according to Lt. Col. Denis Riel of the Rhode Island National Guard. MRAPs, as they are known, usually weigh more than 16 tons. Weichel saw massive truck bearing down on the girl and grabbed her out of the way. But in the process, the armored truck ran him over, Riel said. The little girl is fine. Weichel died a short time later of his injuries. ""He was a big kid at heart. He always had a smile on his face, and he made everyone laugh,"" 1st Sgt. Nicky Peppe, who served with Weichel in Iraq, is quoted as saying in an Army story. ""But as much as Weichel was funny, he was also a professional. When it was time to go outside the wire for a combat patrol, he was all business."" Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee has ordered flags in the state lowered to half-staff until Weichel, who was posthumously promoted to sergeant, is laid to rest Monday. Weichel is survived by his parents, his fiancee and three children. His family will receive Weichel's Bronze Star and other awards for his sacrifice.","Spc.

1964,"(CNN) -- The civilian death toll mounted in Syria Wednesday as the U.N.-Arab League envoy for the country, Kofi Annan, considered a response from Syrian authorities to proposals laid out in weekend meetings, officials said. Annan ""has questions and is seeking answers,"" said a statement by his spokesman. ""But given the grave and tragic situation on the ground, everyone must realize that time is of the essence. As he said in the region, this crisis cannot be allowed to drag on."" The opposition said 56 people died Wednesday across Syria, including 29 in the rebel stronghold of Idlib, where activists reported Syrian military forces had seized control following a four-day onslaught. Only pockets of the city were held by soldiers who have defected, the activists said. Annan met last weekend in Damascus with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an attempt to of reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis, which began almost a year ago. Three U.S. administration officials said earlier that al-Assad doesn't recognize the former U.N. secretary-general as the Arab League's representative and had rejected Annan's efforts. Al-Assad also said he will not do anything until the opposition lays down its arms, the sources said. Annan will brief the U.N. Security Council on Friday, according to the United Kingdom's mission to the United Nations, which holds the Security Council presidency this month. World powers will continue to attempt to pressure al-Assad's regime and focus on getting humanitarian aid to Syrians, U.S. President Barack Obama said Wednesday at a news conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron. The Syrian regime is being isolated politically, diplomatically and economically, by tightening sanctions, Obama said, while the Syrian opposition is growing stronger and military defections are continuing. Cameron said his country wants ""revolution rather than civil war"" in Syria. Syrian state-run media Wednesday said security forces ""have brought safety and security back to the city"" of Idlib, ""which witnessed terrorist acts by armed gangs."" Al-Assad's regime routinely insists ""armed terrorist groups"" are behind the bloodshed in Syria. But the continuing carnage and a scathing report about torture at the hands of the regime suggest there's been no progress in Syria after almost a year of attacks on civilians. In Idlib, the Free Syrian Army, a group of fighters composed primarily of defectors from government forces, had fled the city for ""tactical reasons,"" said Hamza abu al-Hassan, an activist with the opposition Binnish Coordination Committee. Binnish is a town located a few kilometers northeast of Idlib. Clashes had slowed compared with previous days, but shelling continued, he said. Shelling was ongoing on the southwest outskirts of Binnish, al-Hassan said. The shells appeared to have been launched from military barracks south of the town, he said. No casualties resulted, as the shells struck open areas in an apparent attempt to scare residents. Most women and children have fled Binnish, he said. The city has shortages of food and gasoline, as well as medicine, he said. Human Rights Watch, citing accounts from witnesses and activists, said Syria's bombardment of the city of Idlib had killed 114 civilians since March 10. ""Five witnesses, including three foreign correspondents, gave separate accounts to Human Rights Watch that government forces used large-caliber machine guns, tanks, and mortars to fire indiscriminately at buildings and people in the street,"" the group said. ""After they entered Idlib, government forces detained people in house-to-house searches, looted buildings, and burned down houses, the witnesses said."" Government forces also used mortars during the attack on the city, an Idlib resident told Human Rights Watch. Government forces looted shops and apartments and burned down houses of suspected activists, the witnesses said. Throngs of security forces Wednesday infiltrated villages in the port city of Latakia, searching for activists and setting homes afire amid sporadic gunfire, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, or LCC, an opposition activist network. ""This comes under a complete cutoff (of) electricity and telecommunications in the area,"" the LCC said. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. But most reports from inside Syria indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for more than four decades. More than 8,000 people have been killed in the conflict, including many women and children, the president of the U.N. General Assembly said this week. Opposition activists have put the toll at more than 9,000. Two Turkish journalists are missing in Syria, according to Milat newspaper. Adem Ozkose, a columnist and war reporter for Milat and the Middle East correspondent for Gercek Hayat magazine, and Hamit Coskun, a freelance cameraman, were covering events in Syria and shooting a documentary, according to Milat. They were last heard from Saturday, said Turgut Alp Boyraz, a member of the newspaper's foreign editorial board. Three members of the opposition Syrian National Council resigned Tuesday over disagreements with its leadership, Ausama Monajed, adviser to council head Burhan Ghalioun, said Wednesday. The three -- Haitham al-Maleh, Kamal al-Labwani and Catherine al-Telli -- ""wanted radical change within the organization,"" Monajed said. However, the council -- an umbrella organization that represents the Syrian opposition abroad -- is not ready for radical change, he said. The three decided they would be more ""effective working from the outside,"" he said. Also, Saudi Arabia and Italy on Wednesday became the latest countries to suspend embassy activities in Damascus and withdraw their staffs. Spain suspended its embassy activities earlier this month, and the United States and France previously closed their embassies. ""We reiterate the firmest condemnation of the unacceptable violence perpetrated by the Syrian regime against its citizens,"" Italy's foreign office said in a statement. ""Italy will continue to support the Syrian people and to work toward a peaceful solution to the crisis that ensures their fundamental rights and legitimate democratic aspirations."" However, Venezuela's parliament on Tuesday passed ""an agreement in solidarity with Syria in light of the imperial threat presented by the United States and its Arab allies,"" Venezuela's Interior Ministry said Wednesday in a statement. ""The document exhorts the international community and peace lovers to undertake a massive campaign to reject intervention in that nation,"" the statement continued. According to an Amnesty International report released Wednesday, Syrians detained by the regime are subjected to torture, including electric shocks, beatings and sexual violence. Based on interviews with dozens of Syrians who have fled to Jordan, the report details ""31 methods of torture or other ill treatment"" by security forces, the Syrian army and pro-government armed gangs. An 18-year-old identified as Karim told researchers his interrogators used pincers to gouge flesh from his legs while he was held for 25 days in Daraa in December. Detainees also were forced to witness abuse and hear others -- sometimes relatives or friends -- being tortured and raped, the report said. ""I heard the screams of those being tortured for 24 hours a day,"" a 29-year-old identified as Musleh told researchers. ""While in the cell, we were busy praying for the safety of those who are being tortured."" After reports this week of a massacre in Homs, where dozens of women and children were reportedly stabbed and burned to death, authorities ""arrested a number of terrorists who perpetrated the terrifying massacre against the citizens of Karm al Zaitoun neighborhood,"" the news agency reported Wednesday. Both opposition groups and the government reported a massacre in Homs, but opposition activists accused regime forces of carrying out the attacks. Shelling continued Wednesday for a fifth consecutive day on Homs neighborhoods, killing five people and wounding almost 60, activists said. More than 70 rockets and tank shells hit central and eastern neighborhoods in the city; power blackouts were reported in some areas, the activists said. Over the past year, about 30,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring countries, said Panos Moumtzis, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' coordinator for Syrian refugees. CNN's Kareem Khadder, Amir Ahmed, Mitra Mobasherat, Catherine Shoichet and Anna Ozbek contributed to this report.","Wednesday's death toll is at 56, including 29 in Idlib .

1965,"Washington (CNN) -- Thousands of Girl Scouts, former members and supporters swarmed the National Mall on Saturday for the organization's 100-year celebration. With the temperature reaching 90 degrees, 63 people were treated for heat-related incidents and 20 were transported to area hospitals, the District of Columbia Fire and EMS Twitter account said. The heat prompted a steady stream of people at the event's four first aid tents all afternoon, Deputy Chief Kevin Byrne said, with many returning to the festivities after getting some water or ice. At one point, a fire truck was used to spray water on the crowd to cool them off. Organizers declined to comment on any heat-related incidents. The event, ""Girl Scouts Rock the Mall"", brought together scouts from around the world, organizers said, to watch performances, to participate in sing-alongs and other educational activities. Juliette Gordon Low founded the Girl Scouts in 1912. She was posthumously awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Obama last month.","Girl Scouts celebrate organization's 100th birthday .

1966,"Woodward, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Threats of another perilous outbreak of tornadoes appeared to fizzle Sunday, a day after powerful storms tied to the same weather system tore through the Midwest and Plains states. The National Weather Service had issued widespread tornado watches for several states including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Iowa and Illinois. And several big cities -- including St. Louis, Missouri; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Minneapolis and St. Paul in Minnesota -- were thought to be in the line of another stream of powerful storms. Yet while people in many of those areas experienced inclement weather and a handful of tornadoes were reported in several states, the impact paled compared to what others had experienced Saturday and into the early morning hours of Sunday. Survivors in hard-hit Oklahoma town: 'We are truly blessed' As of 10 p.m. CT, the service's Storm Prediction Center had received 10 reports of tornadoes on Sunday. Most of those were from mid-day -- the latest being a reported touchdown at 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET) in McLeod County in Minnesota -- but there was no immediate word of any significant damage during the day and night Sunday, especially in more populated located. The numbers of reported twisters were well below the 122 that the weather service said happened Saturday. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback told CNN that ""97 tornadoes touched down"" in his state, a figure not yet confirmed by the National Weather Service. Oklahoma was also hard-hit, with Gov. Mary Fallin declaring a state of emergency in 12 counties in order to help expedite resources. All the deaths tied to the weekend storm were in Woodward, a small northern Oklahoma city of about 12,000 people about 85 miles west of Enid. Frank Hobbie was confirmed dead along with two girls -- presumed to be Hobbie's 5- and 7-year-old daughters -- said medical examiner's office spokeswoman Amy Elliot. Woodward Mayor Roscoe Hill earlier said a father and his two children were inside their trailer at the Hidden Valley Mobile Home Park when the tornado rolled through and they were killed. Elliot identified one of the other dead as Derrin Juul. A 10-year-old girl also killed was found with him and is presumed to be Juul's daughter. Hill had said that two people died when the car they were in rolled over several times. Another 29 in Woodward were treated for injuries, said Matt Lehenbauer, the city's director of emergency management. ""This thing comes in the middle of the night. It caught us asleep, mostly,"" Hill told CNN. In addition to leveling 89 homes and 13 businesses, the storm ""took out"" the transmitter for the public siren and tornado notification system, and ""we lost our manual override"" when the electricity was knocked out, City Manager Alan Riffel said. Given that and timing of the tornado -- after midnight, and after other severe weather had barreled through -- Fallin said the human cost could have been even worse. ""It's remarkable that we didn't have more loss of life in Woodward,"" she told reporters late Sunday afternoon. Officials credited working early warning systems elsewhere in the region with preventing more fatalities. Advisories from the system were issued two days in advance, rather than just a matter of hours, and were ""remarkably accurate,"" said Brownback. ""People took it very seriously."" In southwest Iowa, officials evacuated the entire population -- roughly 300 people -- of the town of Thurman after a suspected tornado struck Saturday, damaging or destroying three out of every four homes. By early Sunday morning, many Thurman residents who took up temporary shelter at a high school in nearby Tabor were again in the path of a storm that spawned suspected tornadoes in neighboring Kansas. A sign in a park that bears the town's name is one of the few things still standing, said Mike Crecelius, Fremont County's emergency management director. ""That's about all there is. About 75% of the homes are damaged or destroyed,"" he said. ""From the looks of things, there won't be a tree left in that town either."" Four truckers whose rigs were blown off Interstate 29 were the only ones hospitalized -- one with a punctured lung -- due to this particular tornado, the National Weather Service said. The agency reported the twister had winds between 111 and 135 mph as it caused a half-mile long damage path over 10 miles. Across the south and central Plains, storm chasers broadcast images of funnel clouds roaring through rural landscapes. One of the biggest cities hit Saturday and early Sunday was Wichita, Kansas, where resident Katie Sykes said torrential rains produced a ""river in my front yard"" and the prospect of a tornado had her shuddering in fear. ""When I was little we prepared for storms, hearing the sirens and then going to the basement. And going through this experience I felt like a little kid, young and scared,"" the CNN iReporters said. In the basement of her downtown home, 30-year-old Lacy Jay Hansen and her family donned bicycle helmets and crouched against a corner as a suspected tornado churned its way toward her home. ""It turned right in the nick of time for us, striking this other neighborhood,"" she said, later learning the storm destroyed a friend's house several miles away. Eleven months ago, Hansen, her husband and son were in Joplin, Missouri, visiting their ailing grandfather in a hospital when a tornado ripped through, killing 158 people. ""None of us were supposed to be there,"" she said. ""We've always taken it seriously. But ever since then, we take it more seriously."" The tornado that tore through Joplin was one of 1,691 tornadoes that killed a total of 550 people in 2011, according to the National Weather Service. Last year was the fourth deadliest tornado year in U.S. history. The tragedy in Joplin triggered stronger warnings by the weather service about life-threatening storms. More than 24 hours before the storms began rolling across the Midwest on Saturday, the service was cautioning residents of the storm's potential damage. At the Marriott in downtown Wichita, Johnny Williams watched over eight children -- in town for a basketball camp -- in a ballroom where they'd taken shelter. ""We play together as a team, and we believe together as a team,"" Williams said. The storm caused flooding in parts of downtown Wichita, and McConnell Air Force Base also sustained damage, authorities said. A suspected tornado tossed baggage carts across runways at the Wichita Mid-Continent Airport but didn't cause any structural damage, Sedgwick County spokeswoman Kristi Zuckovich said. A few hundred employees were working at a Spirit Aero Systems plant, producing fuselages and other equipment for Boeing aircraft, said company spokesman Ken Evans, when a twister came through and caused the roof to collapse. No one was injured, and workers have been told not to come in until Wednesday as the damage is assessed, added Evans. Damage was also reported to a Hawker Beechcraft building, which manufactures high-performance business jets and turbo-prop planes. Country singer Miranda Lambert's concert Saturday night at the Intrust Bank arena in Wichita was interrupted by an apparent tornado. She was taken off the stage and fans were kept inside, said Lt. Jason Gill of the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office. Later, Lambert tweeted, ""We made it y'all. Thanks for coming out and for making it through the delay with a smile."" The storm destroyed six mobile homes in Wichita County, officials said, but didn't cause any known fatalities in the area. Earlier, a confirmed tornado struck a hospital in Creston, Iowa, blowing out windows and damaging the roof, said John Benson of the Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management agency. There were no major injuries reported, and patients were relocated to other area hospitals. CNN's Susan Candiotti reported from Kansas and Rob Marciano reported from Oklahoma and Kansas. CNN's Josh Levs, Chelsea Carter, Randi Kaye and Maria P. White reported from Atlanta.","10 tornadoes are reported Sunday, including three in Minnesota .

1967,"(CNN) -- Recovery crews in southern New Mexico were working to reach a child's body at the bottom of a 30-foot-deep hole Sunday. Authorities believe the child is Samuel Jones, who went missing Saturday, Carlsbad Police Department spokeswoman Lt. Jennifer Moyers said in a statement. Officials think the child died when he fell into the hole in his neighbor's yard, CNN affiliate KOAT reported. ""We initially began with rescue procedures. Unfortunately, it was discovered that the conditions inside the hole were not survivable, the amount of oxygen that was there, the temperature, that type of thing,"" Carlsbad Police Chief Daniel Fierro told CNN affiliate KRQE. A detective searching for the 4-year-old Sunday morning spotted the body when he shined a light into the neighbor's well, KOAT reported. It could take a day for mining crews to reach the body safely, state police said. ""It breaks my heart, that little boy down there,"" heavy equipment operator Paul Kartscner told KOAT. Crews were digging a trench from the side of the hole and shoring up the sides, KOAT said. Investigators, who said Saturday that they feared the boy had been abducted by a stranger, said Sunday that they were treating the case as a homicide until they determine a cause of death, KRQE reported.

1968,"New York (CNN) -- Seven people, including three children, died Sunday when a vehicle flipped over a guardrail and plunged nearly 60 feet to the ground, landing upside down in an area of the Bronx Zoo that is closed to the public, officials said. The crash occurred near the Bronx River Parkway and East 180th Street. ""Police determined that a 2004 Honda Pilot traveling southbound on the Bronx River Parkway in the left lane had struck the center median, crossed over three southbound lanes and struck the curb, causing the vehicle to become airborne and continue over the guardrail and fall approximately 59 feet down into a wooded area inside of Bronx Zoo property,"" the New York Police Department said in a statement. Police identified the victims as driver Maria Gonzalez, 45; Jocelyn Gonzalez, 10; Maria Nunez, 39; Niely Rosario, 7; Marly Rosario, 3; Jacob Nunez, 85; and Ana Julia Martinez, 81. All were pronounced dead at the scene and an investigation is ongoing, police said. NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said all the victims were wearing seat belts. He had previously given the older girls' ages as 15 and 5. Browne said the driver likely overcompensated when the left side of the SUV struck the barrier. The vehicle was traveling at a high speed, said FDNY Deputy Chief Ronald Werner. Zoo spokeswoman Mary Dixon said the vehicle landed just inside the southeast perimeter of the 265-acre zoo. A baby bag with diapers inside was found at the scene. ""It's far from any public area,"" Dixon said. ""No animals, exhibits or visitors were affected. ... It would be impossible for any visitors to see this."" The area where the vehicle fell is adjacent to where the zoo's trams are parked, Werner said. The fire department's Howard Sickles told reporters that in his 20 years he's ""seen a lot of horrific things and this is one of them."" The crushed vehicle came to rest in overgrown brush, Werner said. Authorities used thermal imaging cameras to find victims in case any had been ejected, he said. Authorities received multiple calls about the incident at about 12:30 p.m., Werner said. In 2006, six people died in an accident on the Bronx River Parkway near the site of Sunday's crash. CNN's Miguel Susana, Steve Kastenbaum, Ross Levitt and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: The dead include three children, ages 10, 7 and 3, police say .

1969,"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, formed Saturday off the coast of South Carolina. Forecasters predict fewer hurricanes this year . As of 5 p.m., the storm was located about 140 miles east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, with maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said. It was churning southwest at 3 mph. No coastal watches or warning were in effect, though a tropical storm watch could be issued for parts of the coast later Saturday, the Hurricane Center said. Is there severe weather near you? Share your photos and videos on iReport (but stay safe) Despite being over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, Alberto is not expected to intensify much over the next couple of days. That is due, in part, to the presence of a cool and dry air mass to the north and west of the tropical storm, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. The forecast track shows Alberto moving slowly toward the south-southwest over the next day or so and then accelerating rapidly toward the northeast, away from the U.S. coast on Monday. This year marks the first time in recorded history that a tropical storm has formed in both the east Pacific basin and Atlantic basin before the official start of hurricane season, the Hurricane Center said. The Pacific storm was called Aletta. The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins on June 1.","NEW: It is not expected to intensify much over the next few days .

1970,"Washington (CNN) -- A hoax mayday call that launched a massive search off the coast of New Jersey last week may be linked to a similar call made last month nearly 1,500 miles away off Texas, authorities said Wednesday. At a news conference in New York, Coast Guard investigators said that in both cases the callers reported their boats were sinking and used similar key words and phrases, leading authorities to believe the calls could have come from the same individual. On May 20, rescuers searched for 36 hours in waters off the coast of Galveston, Texas, and found nothing after a distress call reporting six people stranded in the water, Chief Warrant Officer Lionel Bryant told CNN. Investigators try to track down false yacht mayday . On June 11, a distress call reporting a yacht explosion prompted a massive rescue effort in the water near New Jersey. The call was determined to be fake after no evidence of a boat was found. Officials initially classified the Texas call as unresolved because the Coast Guard could not eliminate the possibility that the distress call came from a vessel in the water. But a Houston television reporter alerted the Coast Guard's New York office to similarities in the two cases, and that led authorities to take a closer look. ""By no means is it a guarantee that this was the same individual that made both calls. We're analyzing the voices on both calls,"" Coast Guard Capt. Gregory Hitchen told reporters. In both instances, the caller described his boat as ""taking on water"" rather than sinking, described the people on board his boat as ""souls,"" said victims were in orange life rafts and used a similar speaking pattern, Hitchen said. Investigators said the calls in both cases seem to have originated from land, he added. The Coast Guard said the estimated cost of the rescue operation in the New Jersey case was $300,000. The agency is relying on the media and tips from the public to find the callers because current technology isn't capable of allowing investigators to pinpoint exactly where the calls came from. Coast Guard offers reward after apparent hoax . But officials are hoping that the person responsible for the false calls finds it difficult to keep quiet. ""They do brag about it in certain cases,"" Hitchen said. More than 100 calls have come in to a tip line, Coast Guard Investigative Service Special Agent Michael Donnelly told reporters Wednesday. Authorities released audio excerpts from both of the mayday calls. In the New Jersey incident, a male voice is heard saying, ""We have 21 souls on board, 20 in the water right now. I have three deceased on board, nine injured because of the explosion we've had. I'm in three feet of water on the bridge. I'm going to stay by the radio as long as I can before I have to go overboard."" In the Texas case, the voice says, ""We're about probably 2 miles from the channel and we are taking on water."" The caller was unable to give an exact location in either call. Anyone convicted of making a false mayday call to the Coast Guard would face six years in prison and a $250,000 fine, but finding such perpetrators has proven difficult for authorities. Investigations rarely have led to an arrest or conviction. There were 60 reported hoax calls in the New York region in 2011, but since 2004 only four people have been convicted for making false distress claims. Authorities don't believe the false calls are terrorism-related. CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","The Coast Guard received apparent false mayday calls off New Jersey and Texas .

1971,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The wreckage of a Russian passenger airliner that went missing during a demonstration flight over Indonesia has been found in a mountainous area, a local official said Thursday. Ali Umri Lubis, the mayor of Bogor, in West Java, said that parts of the Sukhoi Superjet 100 that disappeared off radar screens on Wednesday had been located. But he didn't provide any information on the passengers who were on board. Rescue workers on the ground who have been searching for the plane have not yet been able to reach the wreckage. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia said in a brief televised address Thursday that there was a strong possibility that the plane had crashed into Mount Salak, a volcano south of Jakarta. The Sukhoi jet, Russia's newest civilian airliner, was carrying 42 passengers and eight Russian crew members, according to Sunaryo, an official with Sukhoi's Indonesian agent, Trimarga Rekatama. However, the number was in dispute. The Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency said only 37 of the 42 invited passengers were on board. Russian state-run news agencies reported 44 people were on the plane. The plane was on its second demonstration flight Wednesday when it lost contact with air controllers at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma Airport. ""The first demonstration flight in the morning went smoothly,"" said Sunaryo, who uses only one name. ""There were no problems."" On the second flight, the plane began making its descent but vanished from radar screens at 6,200 feet in a mountainous area. The plane lost contact with air traffic controllers at 2:12 p.m., 21 minutes after taking off, said Marsda Daryatmo, head of the search and rescue agency. Two helicopters were immediately sent out to search for the plane but had to return to their bases due to strong winds and unpredictable weather. The Sukhoi jet arrived in Jakarta as part of a demonstration tour of six Asian countries. It had been to Myanmar, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, and was due to visit Laos and Vietnam after Indonesia, said the Russian news agency RIA Novosti. Sukhoi manufactures military aircraft and is known especially for its fighter jets. Its civilian aircraft is narrow-bodied with a dual-class cabin that can transport 100 passengers over regional routes. It flew its maiden flight in 2008. In March, a Superjet 100 operated by Russia's Aeroflot Airlines was forced to abandon its flight to Astrakhan, Russia, and return to Moscow because of problems with the undercarriage, according to RIA Novosti. A similar defect in another Aeroflot-operated Superjet 100 plane had to be fixed in Minsk in December. Russia's state-run United Aircraft Corp. said the defect did not affect passenger safety.

1972,"(CNN) -- Fourteen people were killed in a fire at a rehabilitation center on the outskirts of Lima, Peru, the state-run Andina news agency reported Saturday. It was not immediately clear what started the blaze, which was the second of its kind in the country this year. ""We found 14 bodies. The majority were on the second floor, in rooms and in hallways. ... It's possible that they were trying to escape, but the doors and windows were closed,"" said fire chief Fernando Campos, Andina reported. The blaze at the Sacred Heart of Jesus center was controlled by firefighters, he said. Twenty-nine people were killed and others were injured in January when a fire broke out at another rehabilitation center in Lima, according to Andina. Some 40 people were housed in a small space with only one exit that was locked with a chain, the news agency reported at the time, citing a fire official. Bypassing a heavy metal door was the biggest challenge in that rescue.","It is not clear what started the blaze at the rehabilitation center near Lima .

1973,"(CNN) -- Nearly 400 people were killed overnight Saturday by government shelling in what is supposed to be a ""no-fire"" zone of Sri Lanka, a humanitarian worker in the area told CNN on Sunday. A photo supplied by a humanitarian group on Sunday shows civilians allegedly injured in government shelling. Most of the roughly 378 dead are civilians, and another 1,200 were wounded, the aid worker said. Video sent to CNN by the pro-Tamil rebel pressure group ACT Now appeared to show dead and wounded civilians. The group says the video was taken Sunday in the ""no-fire"" zone. Another humanitarian group also supplied photos of casualties to CNN. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of either the video or the photos. CNN is not naming the humanitarian sources in the conflict zone to protect their safety. The government denies the assertion it shelled the ""no-fire"" zone, saying it is the Tamil Tiger rebels who have been killing civilians. Tamil Tiger ""attacks using heavy weapons in the no-fire zone have caused immense damage to the civilians entrapped in the area,"" the government information department said, quoting the military. But the military did say it had advanced Saturday into areas previously held by the rebels, officially known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. ""The troops attached to the Air Mobile Brigade further advanced into the 'No Fire Zone' capturing LTTE strong positions in general area Karaiyamullivaikal yesterday,"" military sources said, according to the government's news Web site. ""The LTTE terrorists have laid land mines heavily in the area to obstruct the security forces' advance and a number of LTTE terrorists were killed during fighting while many wounded,"" the government site said. The pro-rebel Web site Tamilnet said rescue workers in the no-fire zone ""have counted more than 1,200 bodies"" and accused the army of ""the use of cluster ammunition, multi-barrel rocket launchers and cannons. ""The workers fear that there may be additional bodies yet to be uncovered, and the numbers killed will likely rise,"" the pro-rebel site said. Aid workers in the country said the situation is worsening and the next few days are ""absolutely critical."" About 165,000 displaced people are in the Vavuniya region, where the United Nations and other humanitarian groups are trying to get relief to them, an aid group said. Meanwhile, a British news team that had been detained by Sri Lankan authorities -- after producing a report about the alleged abuse of Tamils -- has left the country, news managers said Sunday. The Channel 4 news team, which was detained on Saturday, is heading back to its base in Bangkok, Thailand, ITN senior news management said. ITN produces Channel 4's news programs.  Watch journalist explain what angered government » . The team's news report, which aired Tuesday, chronicled the abuse of Tamils in internment camps in the city of Vavuniya in northern Sri Lanka. The report contained claims of bodies being left where they fell, shortages of food and water, and instances of sexual abuse. The government denied the claims and arrested Channel 4 Asia correspondent Nick Paton-Walsh, a cameraman and a producer. The Sri Lankan military has been on an offensive to try to finish off the ethnic Tamil insurgency that has been fighting since 1983 for an independent state in the northeast of the country. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by the European Union and more than 30 countries, including the United States. Tamil Tiger rebels have been pinned down by Sri Lankan government troops in a small section of the country's north, and civilians trapped in the crossfire have been trying to flee.

1974,"(CNN) -- This ought to keep the Maytag repairman busy for a while. The appliance manufacturer along with the Consumer Product Safety Commission on Thursday announced the recall of about 1.7 million dishwashers sold by the company between February 2006 and April of 2010. ""An electrical failure in the dishwasher's heating element can pose a serious fire hazard,"" said the recall notice issued by the CPSC. ""Maytag has received 12 reports of dishwasher heating element fires that have resulted in fires and dishwasher damage, including one report of extensive kitchen damage from a fire,"" the CPSC said.  There have no reports of injuries. The recall includes select Maytag, Amana, Jenn-Air, Admiral, Magic Chef, Performa and Crosley brands manufactured by Maytag. The company has set up a website where customers can check their unit's serial number to see if it is included in the recall -- www.repair.maytag.com.  Consumers will be able to choose between having their dishwasher repaired or accepting a rebate toward the purchase of a new dishwasher. The Maytag repairman has been a staple of the company's corporate image.  Since 1967, Maytag has touted its quality by showing a bored repairman with nothing to do.","Maytag recalls 1.7 million dishwashers for posing fire hazard .

1975,"Washington (CNN) -- At a gathering of his safety-minded peers, John Lee had a confession to make. Last month, while driving to Madison, Wisconsin, Lee glanced down to review a playlist on his car's MP3 player. He scrolled through the titles, looking for Bruce Springsteen songs, ""wanting to avoid the Adele songs that my wife had put there."" Then Lee looked up... and continued driving. There was no crash. No one died. Unremarkable? Lee doesn't think so. Lee, an expert at human-machine interactions at the University of Wisconsin, had just co-authored a paper titled ""Scrolling While Driving."" And despite his own heightened awareness about the dangers of distracted driving, he had spent three to five seconds with his eyes off the road, a time lapse that placed him well into the danger zone. The incident, he said, demonstrated the insidious creep of distracting technology into the automobile. ""It seems like the old technology,"" he said of his car's audio system. ""It seems like a radio. But it isn't."" And if Lee -- who has forsworn cell phone and text messaging in his car -- can be lulled into a distracting experience, anybody can, he said. ""I've been very well-trained to the dangers of distraction, and yet I'm vulnerable,"" he said. Lee's anecdote at a National Transportation Safety Board all-day forum Tuesday hit upon two themes -- the invasion of pernicious technology in automobiles and the precious few seconds it takes to go from an attentive driver to a distracted one. Lee and a panel of experts said that any distraction of two seconds or longer significantly increases the likelihood of a crash. Novice drivers are 16 times more likely to take a dangerous glance inside the vehicle than experienced drivers, the experts said, citing one study. And the risk of a crash increases ""four-fold"" if a driver was on the phone, regardless of whether they were using a hand-held or a hands-free device, they said. Some agreement; some dispute . The forum comes at a time when the NTSB and the Department of Transportation are at odds over just how far the government should go to restrict digital devices in cars. The Department of Transportation is recommending that states ban the use of handheld cell phones and text messaging devices. But the NTSB wants to take it a step further, banning the use of hands-free devices, except those that aid driving. ""Things that are hands-free are distracting too,"" said NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman. ""We'd like to see requirements and standards that look at all distractions, not just the manipulative or the visual distractions, but recognizing that there's a cognitive distraction,"" she said. Experts call it ""looking but not seeing."" ""The issue of cognitive distraction seems to have been left off the table -- forgotten a little bit,"" she said. Distractions everywhere . Driver distractions are hardly new, safety board members and panels acknowledged. Everything from billboards, to beautiful scenery, to pretty girls, have distracted drivers since the advent of automobiles, they said. But new texting technology creates a ""perfect storm"" of activities that create danger, prompting users to look and engage. In addition to taking a driver's eyes off the road and hands off the wheel, texting devices can engage people's minds so that they're paying less attention to the task of driving, the experts said. And the technology is evolving faster than its impact can be appreciated, Lee said. ""The pace of change is daunting. The pace of change far outstrips the pace of regulatory response,"" he explained. An often-quoted study on distracted driving known as the ""100 car study"" was conducted in 2003 and 2004 -- before the introduction of Facebook (2004), Twitter (2006), the iPhone (2007), and iPhone apps (2008), Lee said. Driver distraction is a growing contributor to U.S. traffic fatalities, said Jeff Caird of the University of Calgary. In 1999, there were 4,563 distracted driving fatalities, accounting for 10.9% of all fatalities. In 2008, there were 5,870 distraction fatalities, 15.8% of the total. But police reports are not a reliable source of information for the cause of distracted driving accidents, said Anne McCartt of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The cause of accidents is frequently not reported, and there are very large differences across the states, McCartt said. The best studies, she said, used phone records to determine if drivers were possibly distracted at the time of a crash, she said. Cell phones vs. conversations . Cell phones are more distracting than conversing with passengers, said Donald Fisher of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. A passenger is ""an extra set of eyes,"" and can moderate their conversation during challenging driving periods, unlike a person on a phone, Fisher said. They can serve as a collision avoidance system, ""pointing out hazards and screaming in the extreme case,"" said Lee. Passengers can be distracting too, said Caird. Some modulate conversations; some don't, he said. But for all the study on distracting driving, a lot is still unknown, the experts said. Experts, for example, don't know to what extent drivers self-regulate, confining dialing and texting to less dangerous times, such as at stop lights. And they don't know whether people who choose to buy hands-free devices differ from those who use hand-held devices, and how that may impact test results. But experts at the NTSB forum say distractions of two seconds or more appear to divide safe driving from dangerous driving. The challenge, they said, was getting drivers to understand just how fleeting two seconds is. Fighting fire with fire . The experts say the solution to technological distraction may be technology itself. Already, smart phones have applications that can regulate use, restricting the use of cell phones or texting services while the device is moving, for instance. Industry has become a major force, using dashboard cameras to keep tabs on fleet drivers. Increasingly, new cars are equipped with collision warning systems. And those systems are becoming more sophisticated. At the University of Iowa's National Advanced Driving Simulator, scientists have tested a seat belt that tightens to warn the driver of a possible crash. ""What we've learned is that auditory displays can be a nuisance,"" said Daniel McGehee, of the NADS lab. ""They are annoying. They alert other passengers that something is going on and that's embarrassing to the driver."" However, a seatbelt that tightens, a vibrating seat or a pulsing brake are ""very driver-centric."" ""The driver can say, 'Oops, something's going on here' and sort of reorient their attention."" Back to those play lists . In John Lee's study, 50 people searched for songs on playlists of varying lengths using either an MP3 player or an aftermarket controller while driving on a simulator. The results: searching through long playlists containing 580 songs resulted in poor driving performance and required long glances of two seconds or more. ""Drivers did not adequately adapt their behavior to roadway demand, as evident in their degraded driving performance,"" his study concludes.

1976,"New York (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Irene's swipe at the Big Apple proved Sunday that New Yorkers can be a tough crowd to impress. ""I slept through the whole thing,"" said James Trager, a writer who watched nature's display of fury as it took place outside the windows of his apartment in Midtown and gave a tepid review: ""Nothing. It's exaggerated."" ""I think we're all surprised how relatively quickly the storm blew through here and the rain stopped,"" said Steve Kastenbaum, a national correspondent for CNN radio, who watched the storm from the comfort of his apartment in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn. He said he saw lots of local street flooding and branches in the streets, but few uprooted trees; during the height of the storm, people were walking on the street. ""I even saw one or two folks taking a jog,"" he said. ""I kid you not. Pretty typical for Brooklyn. They're not going to let anybody get in their way."" While the initial effects of the storm were less harsh than anticipated, officials said they were still concerned about flooding from heavy rains that could affect electrical systems and other infrastructure that is largely underground in New York. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it was not yet clear when subways, Metro North trains and Long Island Railroad lines would reopen. ""The conditions are still too dangerous. We can't put people on bridges; we can't put people in tunnels,"" he told CNN affiliate WCBS. ""Once we get a full assessment, we will give people an idea of when the system will come online."" He praised New Yorkers for taking the storm in stride. ""When we have our darkest hours, New Yorkers shine their brightest, and I think this is one of those times."" But the possibility of worse occurring away from the shore was weighing on National Hurricane Center Director Bill Read. ""The biggest concern, now that (Irene's) gone inland, is heavy rain, flash floods"" and wind damage, he told CNN. Once inland, hurricanes ""start falling apart pretty fast,"" he said. ""Eventually, it will exit out into Canada."" ""Overall, I think we've gotten through this,"" Joseph Bruno, commissioner of emergency management for the city, told reporters in Brooklyn, where the skies were bright. He said the hardest-hit areas were from Coney Island in Brooklyn to the Rockaway area of Queens. ""We have 50,000 people without power. That's pretty good in a city of this size. So, we did well, but we prepared well, also."" ""Nothing really that bad happened,"" said Sarah Sargenti, who spent Saturday night in a friend's walkup apartment in Soho rather than risk getting stuck without elevator service in her 23rd-floor apartment near the financial district. ""A lot of wind and rain."" Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, a CNN contributor who was involved in a leadership role in the recovery efforts in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, described Sunday's hurricane as a six out of 10, with 10 representing Katrina. About 30 miles north of the city, in Westchester County's Sleepy Hollow, near the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson, Tom Sobolik was out early Sunday at the Philipse Manor Beach Club. Though the bridge was shut to traffic, ""the boats here are all fine,"" the photographer said. ""Nobody had any problem."" On Saturday night, he attended a hurricane party in his neighborhood to discuss the brewing storm. ""Everybody just went over how they prepared and how it was going to be a waste,"" he said. ""It turned out to be largely true. The media blew this all out of proportion."" It did not flood the 9/11 memorial site in Manhattan, as many had worried it might. Still, the storm left quite a wake -- sending water from the East River and the Hudson River over their banks for a brief period on Sunday morning and into New York City. The water also led officials to close for a brief time the north tube of the Holland Tunnel, from Lower Manhattan to New Jersey. Earlier, authorities had halted public transportation, closed bridges and tunnels and buttoned up ports, essentially locking down the city of more than 8 million people as Hurricane Irene began to lash the city with wind and rain. And New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg urged some 370,000 people to evacuate their residences in low-lying areas. In the Long Island community of Long Beach, massive berms were breached by 8 a.m., with water pushing northward into town. The water yanked a lifeguard building from its foundation on the beach and streets were flooded. Bloomberg ordered evacuations for Long Beach Island, including Atlantic Beach, Lido Beach and Point Lookout. The mandatory evacuations, which also affected parts of Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Staten Island, were a first in the city's history, he said. CNN iReporter and Queens resident Anne Egan, who was watching events unfold from her house three doors down from the beach wall, said she disregarded the evacuation order because she was afraid of looters. ""You can see the waves breaking on (the beach wall),"" she said. ""I was a little panicked approaching high tide, which was about 7:30 a.m. But now that the peak of high tide has passed us, I'm not as nervous. The waves are just huge out there."" More than 905,334 people were without power in New York early Sunday afternoon, authorities said. In Brooklyn, Seunh Hong watched in despair as the water in his shop's basement rose to his knees. ""Way worse than I'd expected,"" he said. ""It is absolutely horrible. Afterwards we have to spend lot of time and money, (and) energy for fixing them up."" Many in New York began preparing days ago for the arrival of Irene, stocking up on essentials. By late Saturday, most stores, restaurants and bars were closed. The bread shelves were bare early Sunday at the Associated Supermarket on Manhattan's Upper West Side, according to Aaron Herman, who said more than 1,000 people had stopped in Saturday to buy the ""essentials."" By then, the streets were largely deserted. ""For a city that never sleeps, it's clearly taking a nap,"" Herman said. CNN's Tom Watkins, Chelsea J. Carter, Holly Yan, Phil Gast, Eden Pontz, Kristina Sgueglia, Jesse Solomon, Cheryl Robinson, Rob Marciano, and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","Katrina recovery veteran ranks Irene as 6 out of 10 .

1977,"(CNN) -- Australian maxi Wild Thing survived a collision with a spectator boat as the Rolex Sydney-Hobart yacht race got off to a spectacular start on Boxing Day. Wild Thing, skippered by 2003 line honors winner Grant Wharington, was keen to lead the annual classic leaving Sydney Harbor on Sunday. But a coming together with a small craft, which contained media representatives, put paid to that hope. Official race website . Wild Thing was forced out early last year through mast problems, but fortunately there was no repeat, as Wharington reported only light damage. ""Luckily we didn't hook in, we just wiped the BBQ off the back corner of their boat,"" he told the official race website. As the 628-nautical mile test entered its first night, four-time line honors winner Wild Oats XI was in the race lead, followed by Wild Thing and super-maxi Investec Loyal. Wild Oats, the current record-holder, is expected to be first over the finish line late Tuesday local time, while Britain's Ran, owned by Skype founder Niklas Zennstrom, is among the favorites for victory on handicap. Strong winds are forecast as the 87-strong fleet battles the Tasman Sea and the notorious Bass Strait. The annual ""Bluewater Classic"" was first held in 1945 and has become one of the highlights of the yachting calendar. But the changeable conditions can offer spell disaster and the 1998 edition saw five yachts sunk and six people died.","Eighty-seven-strong fleet contest annual Rolex Sydney-Hobart yachting classic .

1978,"(CNN) -- A tornado touched down late Friday afternoon in Norman, Oklahoma, bringing scattered structural damage and a taste of more severe weather -- including a tornado outbreak -- expected Saturday in the Plains. No serious injuries were immediately reported in Norman, home to the University of Oklahoma and the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center. Forecasters have said there is a ""high risk"" of severe thunderstorms on Saturday in portions of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma. iReport: Watch hail pound cars in Nebraska . A severe thunderstorm is defined by the National Weather Service as a thunderstorm that produces at least one or more of the following: winds of at least 58 mph, hail 1 inch in diameter and tornadoes. According to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris, ""high risk"" areas could possibly endure EF3 to EF5 tornadoes, packing winds of 136 mph or stronger. A tornado outbreak is likely across the central and southern plains from late Saturday afternoon through the evening and overnight, according to the National Weather Service. CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said the Interstate 35 corridor -- from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Wichita, Kansas -- is a high-risk area. A second high-risk area includes portions of Iowa and Nebraska, where dangerous long-track tornadoes are also possible. Lincoln and Omaha might be affected. An elevated ""moderate"" threat extends from Iowa and Nebraska, southward into the tip of northern Texas. This includes Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Kansas City, Missouri. A ""slight"" risk area extends all the way from Texas to southern Wisconsin. Track the storms . The predicted severe storms come as five National Weather Service offices in Missouri and Kansas are conducting an experiment on how to better convey risks from tornadoes and severe storms. The ""impact based"" warning test, which began earlier this month, comes on the heels of the May 22-27 Midwest/Southeast tornado outbreak, including a tornado that killed 158 people in Joplin, Missouri. The National Weather Service is ratcheting up its efforts to combat complacency, with the help of graphic terms to ensure people find safe shelter. A tornado is confirmed, on average, only once for every four formal warnings. Forecasters in the test area will continue issuing traditional tornado warnings, but for ""significant"" and ""catastrophic"" scenarios, they can add information at the bottom of the warnings issued to media outlets. When a storm has the potential to cause ""significant"" damage, meteorologists may include terms such as ""major house and building damage likely,"" ""complete destruction possible"" or ""major power outages in path of tornado highly likely."" In a ""catastrophic"" outlook, descriptions may include ""This is a life-threatening situation,"" ""You could be killed if not underground or in a tornado shelter,"" or ""complete destruction of entire neighborhoods likely.""

1979,"Cairo (CNN) -- Overcrowding inside a cathedral where Coptic Christians had gathered to pay last respects to their pope caused a stampede that left three people dead and more than 50 injured, a health official said. Coptic Pope Shenouda III, who led the Coptic community for more than four decades, died Saturday. He was 88. On Sunday, thousands of Christians paid their respects to him at the Coptic cathedral in Cairo where his body went on display in an elaborate golden crown and red and golden robes. The mass of people inside the cathedral prompted the stampede, according to Deputy Health Minister Hisham Sheeha, who said three were killed and 52 injured, most suffering from lack of oxygen and low blood pressure. Shenouda's funeral will be held early this week and is expected to bring millions of Christians onto the streets of Egypt at a time when tensions with the Muslim majority are high. Egypt's Christian minority has been the target of a number of high-profile attacks in the past several years. The bombing of a major church in Alexandria in January 2011 left at least 21 people dead, and at least 25 Coptic Christians and their supporters were killed in clashes with the army in October. That incident was the bloodiest in Egypt since its revolution in February. Christians are a very small minority in Egypt, although the Coptic Orthodox Church is the largest Christian church in the Middle East, according the Coptic Orthodox Church Centre in Stevenage, England. The U.S. State Department estimates that Egypt is roughly 9% Coptic Christian, but the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, which released a report on the global Christian population last year, says it is probably closer to 5%. Egypt did not release the number of Christians in its 2006 census, the think tank said. The leader of the Coptic Christian community since 1971, Shenouda was in poor health off and on for many years. He traveled to the United States to undergo medical tests last year. He died of renal failure ""due to the diabetes he endured for years,"" said Sheif Doss, head of the Egyptian General Coptic Association. The pope had lung cancer, which spread to the rest of his body, Doss said. ""The funeral is expected to take place in two days, as massive preparations must take place first. It is a historical event and 2 million people are expected to attend the prayers. I don't expect violence though,"" Doss said. Egypt's Supreme Council announced Sunday three days of mourning for the Coptic Christian community. Shenouda will be buried Tuesday at Emba Bishoy monastery in Wadi Natroun, northwest of Egypt's capital, said Markus Askuf, spokesman for the Coptic Church. The area is home to some of the world's earliest Christian monasteries. Shenouda, a journalist in his youth, was once sentenced to spend four years in Wadi Natroun by the late president Anwar Al-Sadat. In addition to millions of followers in Egypt, the Coptic church has adherents in Europe, Canada, the United States, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa. U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife offered their condolences Saturday after news of Shenouda's death spread, saying he will be remembered as ""a man of deep faith, a leader of a great faith, and an advocate for unity and reconciliation."" ""His commitment to Egypt's national unity is also a testament to what can be accomplished when people of all religions and creeds work together,"" the Obamas said. When a Coptic pope dies, all 150 bishops of the church's Holy Council appoint an acting patriarch until a vote is conducted for a successor, Doss said. Thousands of bishops, priests and monks are eligible to vote. The most senior bishop usually takes the role of acting patriarch. In this case, that would be Bishop Michael of Asiut. If he declines, Bishop Bakhamious of Behira is next in line, Doss said.","NEW: Stampede breaks out inside cathedral, leaving 3 dead and 52 injured .

1980,"(CNN) -- A four-vehicle U.N. convoy was struck by a blast from an explosive device Tuesday in Syria, the United Nations said. No U.N. personnel were injured, but three vehicles were damaged, said Ahmad Fawzi, spokesman for Kofi Annan, special envoy to Syria for both the United Nations and the Arab League. The attack on the vehicles happened around the same time government forces opened fire on a nearby funeral procession, according to opposition groups. Twenty-three people were killed and 100 were injured in that attack, Avaaz, one of the groups, said. Another opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, described dozens of people falling to the ground after government forces fired on them using heavy machine guns. Videos posted on YouTube purported to show what happened. CNN cannot confirm their authenticity. In one, the U.N. observers' vehicles appear to in the midst of chaos in Khan Cheikhoun, part of Idlib province. Shoes are strewn about on the street and people can be seen gathering near the stopped vehicles. Suddenly, there is a loud bang and plumes of smoke drift up into the sky. The camera flashes to what looks to be the front of the U.N. convoy, showing one of the vehicles with its hood now popped open. After a few seconds, the vehicles drive away. ""The Assad army is shelling the observers' vehicles in Khan Cheikhoun!"" someone yells. A second video allegedly shows the attack on the funeral procession. A voice taunts what appears to be security forces. ""Are you going to shoot us, or what? You dogs, shoot!"" the man shouts. Seconds later, the forces open fire and people scatter, fleeing the area. Idlib was the site of some of the heaviest violence Tuesday, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. At least 63 people were killed, including 33 in Idlib, eight in Homs, seven in Deir Ezzor, five in Hama, four in Banyas, four in Damascus suburbs, one in Hasakeh and one in Daraa, the group said. SANA, the state-run news agency, said terrorists were preparing a bomb in Banyas when it exploded, leaving ""scores"" of people dead or wounded. A 3-year-old child died in the collapse of the building, SANA said. Two law enforcement personnel were killed -- one in Daraa and one in Homs, the agency reported. Throughout the uprising against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Syria has blamed the violence on ""armed terrorist groups."" The jihadist Al Nusra Front has denied a claim that it was behind dual suicide bombings that killed 55 and wounded hundreds in the Syrian capital last week. A video purportedly from Al Nusra Front released Saturday said that government buildings in Damascus were targeted ""because the regime continues to shell residential civilians."" But a statement this week from Al Nusra Front said the video ""is full of fabrications."" ""We never received any confirmation, acknowledgment or denial from our military sector in the front,"" the group said. Dissidents accuse the Syrian regime of staging attacks to smear the opposition and to try to link rebels to terrorist groups such as al Qaeda. Syrian forces carried out a siege Tuesday at Raqa University in northern Syria after a massive demonstration and fired live ammunition at a college student demonstration in Aleppo, the Local Coordination Committees said. Some rebels say they have had to sell their cows, cars or their wives' jewelry to buy guns and bullets to fight. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for 42 years. International pressure against al-Assad's government ratcheted up this week, with European Union foreign ministers imposing new sanctions against the regime Monday. The EU ministers froze the assets of two firms and imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on three people believed to be providing funding for the regime, the European Council announced. It was the 15th time the European Union has imposed restrictions on Syria since the popular uprising began there. ""The continuing violence is appalling,"" EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Monday, stressing that the sanctions are aimed at the regime and not the civilian population. ""As long as the repression continues, we will continue to put pressure on those responsible for it."" Just 300 yards from the Syrian border, hundreds of Syrians have found safety at a Turkish refugee camp. Though they have fled the fighting, many are haunted by memories of the 14-month-long bloodshed. Abu Mohammed recalled how two of his sons had been fatally shot by security forces while demonstrating in Syria about a year ago. Another son is missing, believed to be arrested and possibly killed without ever having met his 7-month-old son. Mohammed said he cannot justify the Syrian security forces' actions. He knows why his sons spoke up and why many are still fighting. ""We had young men that cried out and shouted, 'Freedom!' -- and they were killed for that?"" he asked rhetorically. ""We just want freedom. What's wrong with asking for freedom?"" But the Syrian government Tuesday touted ""the widest turnout of voters for Syrian parliamentary elections,"" which took place May 7. ""The citizens exercised their full rights, and they had total freedom in choosing their representatives,"" Judge Khalaf al-Azzawi, chairman of Higher Committee for Elections, said on state TV. The United Nations estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the 14-month crisis, while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000. CNN cannot independently verify reports of deaths and violence because the Syrian government has severely restricted access by international media. CNN's Saad Abedine, Ivan Watson, Anderson Cooper and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","NEW: Government forces fire on a funeral procession, opposition groups say .

1981,"London (CNN) -- Energy giant Total has found the source of a gas leak on an offshore oil platform in the North Sea, the company told CNN on Thursday. The leak is on the deck level of the well head platform, Total said. The Elgin platform sprang a leak Sunday, forcing the evacuation of the rig. Experts are working to decide whether they can wait for the gas to stop leaking on its own, or whether the company must drill a relief well or fill it with mud in a ""kill operation,"" Total said. Nearly 240 workers were taken off the rig as the problem developed Sunday, Total has said. The leak seems to have started as workers were sealing the well in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east of the Scottish city of Aberdeen. ""Ironically, it sounds as if, just like with the Deepwater Horizon, they were closing off a well and somewhere along the line something went wrong,"" oceanographer Simon Boxall said, referring to the major BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The Elgin leak has echoes of the BP spill, but there are differences. The Elgin is in shallower water, which could make problems easier to fix, but it is leaking gas, rather than oil. Gas ignites more easily. ""This is nothing on the scale of the Gulf spill two years ago,"" Boxall said. ""This is a relatively light spill. The gas itself is dispersing quite rapidly."" ""The hope is that there is so little gas pressure in there that it will just blow itself out,"" he said of the Elgin spill. Total's share price was down about 2% in trading in France on Thursday afternoon. The French company's share price fell 7% Tuesday on news of the leak, but market analyst firm Jeffries International said Wednesday that it thought the market had overreacted. A union representing workers on the rig warned Wednesday that there was an ""urgent need"" to stop the leak. ""If the gas cloud somehow finds an ignition source, we could be looking at complete destruction,"" said Jake Molloy, an official with the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. ""This is an unprecedented situation, and we really are in the realms of the unknown,"" he said. But oceanographer Boxall said the risk of explosion may not be as high as initially feared. ""Initially, the risk of explosion was seen as being very high. There were reports coming through of a large gas cloud enveloping the whole rig,"" he told CNN. But the fact that there has been no blast when the flare on the gas rig is still burning ""obviously contradicts the idea that there was a very high risk of explosion,"" he said. ""Perhaps the quantity of gas is not that great as first thought,"" he said. For the moment, the wind seems to be blowing the gas cloud away from the flare on the Elgin rig. The winds over the North Sea around the Eglin platform are predicted to remain strong (40-50 kph, with gusts over 60 kph) and out of the northwest through Friday. On Saturday, the winds are expected to shift slightly out of the north, as an area of high pressure drifts eastward over the British Isles, and they should weaken Sunday. Scattered light showers are possible Friday and Saturday, but the area should stay mostly dry through the weekend. Total said there was a ""sheen on the water in the vicinity of the platform,"" but said Tuesday there was no indication of environmental damage and there had been no injuries. Shell partially evacuated two of its nearby platforms, Shearwater and Hans Deul, as a ""purely precautionary"" measure, it said Wednesday. The North Sea was the scene of the world's worst offshore rig disaster, the Piper Alpha explosion, which killed 167 people in 1988. CNN's Bharati Naik and Brandon Miller contributed to this report.","The Elgin platform leak is not underwater, energy firm Total says .

1982,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The grisly search for remains at the scene of a commercial plane crash in Pakistan continued Saturday, with officials doubting anyone on board survived. The plane, carrying 127 people, crashed Friday in Islamabad just before it was to land at a nearby airport, according to Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, which cited poor weather as a possible factor. At least 120 bodies have been recovered from the scene, Interior Minister A Rehman Malik said. No survivors have been found. ""In the morning we will start to search by helicopters,"" Malik said overnight, adding that officials could not bring in helicopters on Friday due to bad weather. The Bhoja Air Boeing 737-200 was en route from Karachi to Islamabad, where the weather was cloudy, officials said. Malik said family members in Karachi are being flown in to help identify the victims. Relatives and fingerprints have already helped identify the remains of 73 people taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr. Wasim Khawaja said. Identifying all the bodies -- many of which lie in pieces -- will be challenging, Malik said. He said he hoped DNA technology will help in the process. From what he's seen, ""I don't see any survivor here -- all 127 people seem to be dead,"" the interior minister said. The crash occurred near the Chaklala airbase, a military site used by the country's air force, which is adjacent to the Benazir Bhutto International Airport in Islamabad. Debris and body parts were scattered across the crash site as workers sifted through the wreckage in the heavily populated residential area. Four villages were affected by the crash, and debris from the plane has been recovered within a kilometer of the site, Malik told reporters. More than a 150 bags filled with body parts have been transported to hospitals across the region, according to Farkhand Iqbal, a municipal official in Islamabad. World's deadliest plane crashes . Malik said he is ready to launch a security probe through the Federal Investigation Agency in case the Civil Aviation Authority's investigation shows evidence of any security breaches. He also said Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has ordered a ""high-powered investigation."" Head of Bhoja Air, Farooq Omar Bhoja, has been put on an exit control list, meaning he can leave the country without government clearance, he said. The flight data recorder, which is considered a key component in determining what may have caused the tragedy, was recovered, officials said Friday. The Bhoja airliner had been flying from the southern seaport city of Karachi and crashed just before touching down in the capital after its 3Â½-hour flight. Weather reports indicated that conditions in the area included thunderstorms and limited visibility. Authorities are examining what may have caused the crash and the potential for additional casualties at the site of the wreckage. Investigators are ""going to be looking at technology,"" aviation security consultant Greg Feith said. ""What kind of radio equipment, what kind of ground proximity warning system the aircraft was equipped with, weather radar, things like that ... since the weather may be a factor in this accident."" Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani on Friday expressed ""deep shock and grief over the tragedy,"" ordering his country's Civil Aviation Authority ""to gear up all its resources for rescue operation,"" state media reported. A separate inquiry into the incident has been launched by Pakistan's Safety Investigation Board, and two crisis operation rooms have been set up at airports in both Islamabad and Karachi to provide information to the affected families. A Boeing spokeswoman said the American manufacturer ""stands ready to provide technical assistance to the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan."" The airliner was originally sold in 1985, Julie O'Donnell said. Comair, a South African airline, said in a statement Saturday that it operated the plane under the British Airways brand from 1996 until late 2011. ""The aircraft was retired due to it being too uneconomical for Comair to operate because of its small seat capacity and high fuel consumption,"" said Comair spokeswoman Nicola Nel. ""It was sold to Jet Aviation in Dubai who leased it on to Bhoja Air at the end of 2011. The aircraft was sold in a serviceable condition."" Responding to allegations that the aircraft was not in good condition to fly, Defense Secretary Nargis Sethi told a local television station that the government has initiated ""an immediate investigation."" ""Whether it was 10, 8 years old, or not airworthy, is something that we can't confirm yet,"" Sethi said. But Bhoja Air station manager Zahid Bangish told a Pakistani television station later Friday that the ""aircraft was new, not the old one and unairworthy."" The crash is reminiscent of one in 2010, when 152 people were killed as a Pakistani passenger plane crashed on the outskirts of Islamabad.

1983,"(CNN) -- Donations to the fundraising page of a young woman who died less than one mile (1.6km) from the London Marathon finishing line, are heading towards the $1 million mark. As news of Claire Squires' death spread across social media sites, so too did the link to her Just Giving fundraising page, sparking a flurry of donations reaching more than £400,000 ($650,000) and rising fast by Tuesday afternoon. The hairdresser, from North Kilworth in Leicestershire, died near St James's Park on the final stretch of the 26.2 mile (42km) course on Sunday. The 30-year-old, who had climbed Mount Kilimanjaro just last month, collapsed as she ran up Birdcage Walk -- the final stretch covered by competitors before reaching Buckingham Palace and turning on to The Mall. Paramedics were unable to revive her and she died at the scene. The cause of death is not yet known. News of the tragedy quickly spread on Twitter and Facebook, helping prompt a flood of donations to her chosen charity, the Samaritans. The donations, which initially stood at £500 ($800), surged throughout Monday and Tuesday as publicity spread through social and conventional media sources. Almost 40,000 donations have been made on Squires' fundraising page, with many people including heartfelt messages of sympathy to the tragic woman's family. She had chosen to run for the Samaritans after her mother Cilla volunteered with the charity for 24 years. She had posted on her fundraising page: ""hi guys as you all know i am running the london marathon it was just going to be for fun. but its a fab opportunity to raise money for my charity the samaritans if everyone i know could donate £5.00 ($8) that would be a great help and change lives."" Catherine Johnstone, chief executive of the Samaritans, said the charity had been overwhelmed by the response. ""We desperately wish that it was not under these circumstances but we have been overwhelmed by the response from people donating in Claire's memory,"" she said. ""These donations will be put into a tribute fund and, following discussions with the family, will go towards projects they feel would have been important to Claire."" Devastated friends described Squires as a keen charity fundraiser who last month climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for the Royal Air Force Association . ""Claire was larger than life, fun-loving, bubbly, happy, cheerful, kind, giving, thoughtful. She was just the most amazing person in the world - the best friend I have ever had,"" friend Victoria Hauser told 5 News. ""She was a giver, all the time. It's been never-ending. She's done the Great North Run, she's done a climb on Kilimanjaro, she's done a marathon previously for the Children's Society."" Around 37,500 runners took part in the marathon and Squires' death is the 10th since the race began in 1981. She is the only woman to have died in the marathon. The most recent death was that of David Rogers, a 22-year-old fitness instructor, in 2007.","Social media boosts donations to tragic London Marathon runner's website .

1984,"San Francisco (CNN) -- San Francisco firefighters were battling a three-alarm blaze Wednesday at a downtown waterfront pier that's slated to host events for the America's Cup yacht race. So far, no injuries have been reported. About 75 firefighters were fighting the blaze at the Pier 29 warehouse building, San Francisco Fire Department Capt. Jeanne Seyler told CNN. The cause of the blaze, about a mile from the popular tourist site of Fisherman's Wharf, was not immediately known, Seyler said. The pier is one of two on San Francisco's Embarcadero set to house the America's Cup Village for the 2013 yacht race. The facade and decorative archway at the front of the pier appear to have extensive damage. CNN recommends: Coast Guard says 2 bogus mayday calls possibly linked .

1985,"Cairo (CNN) -- The recent health crisis for former Egyptian ruler Hosni Mubarak started when he slipped in a prison bathroom, his attorney told CNN Thursday. The ousted strongman hurt his neck and developed a blood clot after the fall in Tora prison, attorney Farid El Deeb said. El Deeb said Mubarak was taken off life-support equipment and his health improved on Wednesday, a day after grim and contradictory news emerged over the 84-year-old man's health. The state-run Middle East News Agency reported that he was ""clinically dead."" The nation's military rulers denied the report, with one general saying Mubarak's health was deteriorating and he was in critical condition. Mubarak was transferred from Tora prison to Maadi Military Hospital. Now, El Deeb said, his ailing client is out of a coma and under the care of doctors at the facility's intensive care unit. ""He had slipped in the bathroom of Tora prison and hurt his neck, which caused a blood clot that started all his medical problems that night, last Tuesday, including heart attack and irregular breathing,"" El Deeb said. He said he had warned before that ""the prison hospital was not equipped with well-trained nurses or personnel to assist him or proper equipment."" The lawyer said he hadn't been informed about how the latest bout of health problems started because he was in Lebanon when Mubarak fell sick. ""I was getting information by phone with a minute-to-minute update, but I learned that he fell when I returned to Cairo,"" he said. The hospital, located minutes away from Tora prison, is under heavy security. Dozens of Mubarak supporters and opponents stood outside the hospital Wednesday and argued. Security forces stepped in to prevent clashes. Maadi is the same hospital where former president Anwar Sadat died after he was shot in 1981. Mubarak became president after the assassination. He ruled Egypt with an iron hand and as a staunch ally of the United States, which gives the nation $1.3 billion a year in military aid. More than 800 people died and 6,000 were wounded during the uprising that ended Mubarak's 29-year rule in February 2011. Mubarak and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were convicted of ordering security forces to kill anti-government protesters and this month were given life terms. But other top aides -- as well as Mubarak's two sons, who had been tried on corruption charges -- were acquitted. El Deeb appealed the verdict four days after it was issued. He has until August 1 to submit a memo indicating the reasons for the appeal . Prior to his sentencing, Mubarak was already suffering from health problems; he attended court on a gurney. He had been in Tora for 17 days until he was transferred to Maadi. Some citizens thought the Mubarak health scare was staged to focus attention away from the controversies over Egypt's elections. Reports of Mubarak's failing health have taken a back seat to the political and constitutional turmoil in the country. Egypt's Presidential Election Commission has delayed, from Thursday until a date to be announced, the release of the results of Egypt's presidential election, state-run Nile TV reported Wednesday. ""The committee has not completed the verification of a total of 400 electoral violation reports submitted by the two presidential candidates,"" said Tarek Shibl, a senior member of electoral committee. ""Most probably the announcement of the election results will be delayed a day or two but nothing is final yet."" The results of last weekend's runoff between Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister to serve under Mubarak, and Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, remain uncertain. Shafik and Mosri each proclaimed himself winner in the race to succeed Mubarak 16 months after a popular uprising ended his three-decade rule. Military rulers dissolved the lower house of parliament last week, extending their power and sparking accusations of a coup. The military council announced it had full legislative authority. The Muslim Brotherhood, the country's largest Islamist group, was the dominant party in the parliament. Under an interim constitutional declaration released Monday, the military council retains the power to make laws and budget decisions until a new constitution is written and a new parliament elected. The declaration says Supreme Council members ""shall decide all matters related to military affairs, including the appointment of its leaders."" The president has the power to declare war, it says, but only ""after the approval"" of the Supreme Council.","Mubarak developed a blood clot when he hurt his neck in the fall, his lawyer says .

1986,"London (CNN) -- A 23-year-old English Premier League soccer player remained in intensive care Monday after suffering cardiac arrest during a game in London, his club Bolton said. Saturday's match between top-flight teams Bolton and Tottenham was called off after Fabrice Muamba, a Bolton midfielder, collapsed on the pitch before halftime. Medics came onto the field to try to revive him while fans and players looked on in shock. Muamba was taken to the Heart Attack Center at The London Chest Hospital, where he has been kept since. ""Fabrice Muamba's heart condition is stable, but he remains critically ill in intensive care,"" read Monday's joint statement from Bolton and the hospital. Bolton manager Owen Coyle said Muamba's family appreciated the large amount of messages of support they had received. ""The message is the good will, the prayers from everybody, they are so thankful and they want to put that on record -- to say 'keep up the prayers, thanks for all the support,' "" Coyle told reporters outside the hospital after visiting the player Monday. ""They have been inundated as we all have, both in the football community globally and family and friends. People are taking a genuine interest and a real concern with how Fabrice is doing."" ""It's a difficult situation but the family are bearing up as well as they can. They themselves are very positive people,"" Coyle said. ""You look at what Fabrice has been through in life already and you can tell that he is a fighter. He has such a fantastic smile and that's what we all want to see again."" Magunda also thanked fans via her account on micro-blogging website Twitter. ""2 everyone out there thank u so much for all the love and support collectively as a family we appreciate it all. Plz continue 2 pray 4 fab x,"" she wrote on Monday. ""Fabrice WILL!! Pull through because God is good. Love u so much @fmuamba keep strong we're praying for u honey xx"" Bolton said Sunday that Muamba received ""prolonged resuscitation"" on the ground and en route to the hospital, where his heart eventually started working. ""As is normal medical practice, Fabrice remains anesthetized in intensive care and will be for at least 24 hours,"" the club said. ""His condition continues to be closely monitored by the cardiac specialists at the hospital."" Players pray for Muamba's recovery . Muamba, who is from the Democratic Republic of Congo and has represented England at under-21 level, fell to the ground in the 41st minute with no other players near him. Referee Howard Webb consulted both teams before calling off the match at Tottenham's home ground in London, which was a quarterfinal tie in England's prestigious knockout competition, the FA Cup. A member of CNN World Sport's London staff was at the match at White Hart Lane and described the situation. ""We were situated on the halfway line. ... Fabrice Muamba just hit the deck out of nowhere,"" assistant producer Zayn Nabbi said by phone. ""We realized quite quickly that this was serious because the medical staff all rushed on and they were waved onto the field by the Tottenham players. From what we saw they were trying to resuscitate Fabrice Muamba."" Bolton Wanderers announced Sunday that its match with Aston Villa, scheduled for Tuesday evening, was postponed after talks with the club and the Premier League. Bolton thanked them both for their support and understanding. Muamba's peers have been quick to show their support on micro-blogging website Twitter. ""For all those asking, I know as much as you do,"" wrote clubmate Stuart Holden, a U.S. international. ""Waiting anxiously for updates from teammates. Fab is a fighter! prayforMuamba."" Tottenham's Rafael van der Vaart wrote: ""Terrible what happened with Muamba during the game. We're all praying for him."" The last player to die after collapsing in a match in Britain was Motherwell's Phil O'Donnell, who suffered heart failure during a 2007 game against Scottish rivals Dundee United and passed away on the way to hospital. The most high-profile such tragedy was when Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe collapsed during a Confederations Cup semifinal against Colombia in 2003 and died in hospital. There have been two similar incidents more recently in Spain, involving Sevilla's Antonio Puerta in 2007 and Espanyol's Daniel Jarque in 2009. Muamba grew up in Kinshasa, the capital of what was then known as Zaire. After moving to the UK in 1999 he began his football career with Premier League club Arsenal in 2005 but did not make a first-team appearance in the top division and was loaned out to Birmingham. He signed a permanent deal with the Midlands club in 2007 before moving to Bolton a year later for a fee of Â£5 million ($8 million). English Football Association chairman David Bernstein paid tribute to Muamba, who played for his country at most age-group levels. ""Fabrice has played 33 times for England Under-21s, captaining Stuart Pearce's side during this time, and is a player -- and more importantly -- a person we care greatly for,"" Bernstein said. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore praised those at the game for the way they reacted to the situation. ""We would like to praise the players, match officials, coaching staff and medical teams of both clubs at White Hart Lane for their swift actions in attending Fabrice,"" Scudamore said in a statement. ""The League would also like to commend the compassion shown by the fans of Bolton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur."" Those sentiments were echoed by Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, who in a club statement, thanked both sets of fans for their support and behavior. Levy said: ""Too often we read the negatives about football and yet last night, at a time of intense emergency and uncertainty, we saw the true humanity and empathy of the footballing family.""","Fabrice Muamba still in critical condition in intensive care at London heart hospital .

1987,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Bad weather hampered recovery efforts Friday as rescue teams combed a forbidding slope of an Indonesian mountain where a Russian jetliner crashed on a demonstration flight this week. Rescuers found 12 bodies early in the day, according to Vice Marshal Daryatmo, head of the National Search and Rescue Agency, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. It will take at least two weeks to identify the victims through DNA tests, Indonesian authorities said. All 45 on board the Sukhoi Superjet 100 are feared dead. The Superjet 100, Russia's newest passenger plane, slammed into Mount Salak, a volcano south of Jakarta, after disappearing from radar screens Wednesday. Most of the wreckage is on a steep slope about 6,000 feet high, making it difficult to reach. The cause of the crash remained unclear. The Russian Investigative Committee said it has launched a criminal probe into possible safety violations. ""We can understand how the families are feeling right now, and we want to do this evacuation as fast as we can, but the problem is the crash site terrain is unreachable by parachute,"" Daryatmo said at a news conference Friday. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono announced a joint investigation Friday after a phone call with his Russia counterpart, Vladimir Putin. ""I welcome the offer from Russian President Putin because the goal is to investigate what could have caused the plane crash,"" Yudhoyono said. The Russian Investigative Committee had said 48 people were on board the plane, including eight Russian crew members. But the Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti said the number was 45, citing Sukhoi Civil Aviation President Vladimir Prisyazhnyuk as saying three of the people on the passenger list did not board the flight. The plane was on a demonstration flight for Indonesian Ministry of Transportation officials and representatives of Indonesian airlines, the Russian Embassy in Jakarta said before the crash. Indonesia's Sky Aviation signed a $380 million deal in 2011 to buy 12 Sukhoi Superjet 100s, and press reports said a number of Sky employees were on the plane that went down. Sukhoi employees are also among the missing. It was the first crash of a Sukhoi Superjet 100, RIA Novosti said. The plane was on its second demonstration flight Wednesday when it lost contact with air controllers at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma Airport. The Sukhoi jet arrived in Jakarta as part of a demonstration tour of six Asian countries. It had been to Myanmar, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, and was scheduled to visit Laos and Vietnam after Indonesia, RIA Novosti said. Sukhoi manufactures military aircraft and is known especially for its fighter jets. Its civilian aircraft is narrow-bodied with a dual-class cabin that can transport 100 passengers over regional routes. It flew its maiden flight in 2008 and has had encountered problems in the past. In March, a Superjet 100 operated by Russia's Aeroflot Airlines was forced to abandon its flight to Astrakhan, Russia, and return to Moscow because of problems with the undercarriage, according to RIA Novosti. A similar defect in another Aeroflot-operated Superjet 100 plane had to be fixed in Minsk in December. However, Russia's state-run United Aircraft Corp. said the defect did not affect passenger safety.

1988,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A massive earthquake struck off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Wednesday afternoon, triggering a tsunami watch for the Indian Ocean, which was later canceled. The quake struck about 434 kilometers (270 miles) southwest of Banda Aceh, the capital of Indonesia's Aceh province, and had a magnitude of 8.6, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It took place at a depth of 23 kilometers (14 miles). A second large quake, with a magnitude of 8.2, occurred off the west coast of Sumatra about two hours later, the USGS said. Gary Gibson from the Seismology Research Center in Melbourne, Australia, said the location of the second quake reduced the possibility of a tsunami. There was also a series of smaller quakes off the west coast of northern Sumatra with magnitudes between 5.1 and 5.4. There were no reports of destruction or deaths. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said on local television that there were no reports of casualties or damage in Aceh. Four people were slightly injured on Simeulue Island, off the coast of Aceh, the National Disaster Management Agency said Wednesday. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami watch for the entire Indian Ocean. And a few hours later, the center announced the tsunami watch was canceled. ""A significant tsunami was generated by this earthquake. However, sea level readings now indicate that the threat has diminished or is over for most areas,"" the center said. How are earthquakes measured? The center earlier said that ""when no major waves have occurred for at least two hours after the estimated arrival time or damaging waves have not occurred for at least two hours, then local authorities can assume the threat is passed."" The center posted approximate arrival times for waves in different parts of the region, which were predicted at various times in different cities throughout the day. Waves were reported at 1-meter (about 3.3-foot) amplitude -- or height above sea level -- offshore in Meulaboh, Indonesia, but in other cities, they were reported at about a foot or less, according to the warning center. British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that Britain ""stands ready to help if required."" The first quake took place at 2:38 p.m. local time (4:38 a.m. ET). It appears to have involved a horizontal movement rather than a vertical movement, so it is less likely that it will generate a tsunami, Gibson said. He also said that the tremor took place a long way offshore and was therefore unlikely to have caused much damage. Still, officials called on coastal residents in some low-lying areas in the region to seek higher ground. The power went out in Banda Aceh, and residents moved to higher elevations, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency. The areas most at risk of a tsunami are coastal areas of Aceh, particularly the island of Simeulue, Prih Harjadi, an official for the Indonesian geophysics agency, said on Metro TV. In some areas, residents were allowed to return after the tsunami watch was lifted. In Thailand, the National Disaster Warning Center issued an evacuation order for residents and tourists along the Andaman coast, state-run news agency MCOT said. ""The tremor was felt as far as in Bangkok where office workers at several high-rise buildings said their workplaces were shaken"" for three to five minutes, the report said. ""Several southern provinces also felt the tremors."" In the Maldives, some resorts were evacuated in advance of possible waves, according to CNN's Erin Burnett, who was on vacation in the region. ""What strikes me most is essentially the lack of a warning system"" in the Maldives, she said. Officials rely primarily on information from the USGS, Burnett said. Interactive: World's deadliest earthquakes . In 2004, a 9.1-magnitude underwater earthquake off the coast of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people in 14 countries. The majority of the deaths were in Indonesia, with Aceh bearing the brunt. That quake took place 250 kilometers (155 miles) south-southeast of Banda Aceh at a depth of 30 kilometers (19 miles). The tsunami, which washed away entire communities, caused nearly $10 billion in damage and more casualties than any other tsunami in history, according to the United Nations. Since then, officials have worked to improve warning systems and have carried out drills in the region. Indonesia is on the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The earthquake Wednesday comes just over year after a magnitude-9 quake off the northeast coast of Japan caused a devastating tsunami. The death toll from that disaster stands at about 15,850. iReport: Earthquake in Dhaka .

1989,"(CNN) -- Emergency officials report at least 27 people in nine states have died as a result of Hurricane Irene. North Carolina -- 6 . Pennsylvania -- 5 . Virginia -- 4 . New York -- 3 . Vermont -- 3 . Connecticut -- 2 . New Jersey -- 2 . Maryland -- 1 . Florida -- 1 . Authorities are trying to determine whether an additional death reported in New York is connected to the storm. Here is a state-by-state breakdown: . New York . -- A 50-year-old man was electrocuted Sunday while trying to aid a father and son who came in contact with a downed power line on a flooded street in Spring Valley in southern New York, police there said. -- The body of woman who apparently drowned after she either fell or was swept into a storm-swollen creek was recovered Sunday near New Scotland, New York State Police said. -- One man in Croton, New York, died Sunday while boating along with four others down the Croton River, said Lt. Russell Haper, a spokesman for the Croton police. The boat overturned in the strong rapids. The 53-year-old man was found dead after a three-hour rescue effort. The other men were pulled safely from the water. -- Authorities are trying to determine whether the drowning death of a windsurfer whose body was discovered Sunday in New York's Bellport Bay is related to Irene, Suffolk County Police said. This death is not included in the fatality count until the determination is complete. Pennsylvania . -- One person was killed in an overnight traffic accident in Carbon County, said Ruth Miller, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. -- In separate incidents, a man in a camper and a man in a tent were crushed when trees fell on them, Miller said. -- A 64-year-old woman was found dead Sunday by Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, police after her family grew concerned when she did not show up for work. Her body was found a half-mile from where her car was abandoned in a deluged creek, police said. -- Miller did not immediately have details on the fifth death, but said it was a storm-related fatality. Connecticut . -- Gov. Dan Malloy told reporters that state police were reporting an apparent storm-related fatality ""related to downed wires."" -- A man in Bristol, Connecticut, was killed Sunday when the canoe he and another man were riding in failed to clear a bridge on the Pequabuck River and flipped, Bristol Police Department spokesman Edward Spyros said. The man's death appeared to be an accidental drowning. The other man surfaced alive. Florida . -- Witnesses spotted a 55-year-old surfer face down in the water Saturday off New Smyrna Beach, Florida, said Capt. Tamara Marris, a spokeswoman for the Volusia County Beach Patrol. He was nonresponsive and had a large cut on his head when emergency personnel examined him. Marris said the death was connected to the storm because ""the surf that we had this morning was a remnant of Hurricane Irene."" Maryland . -- A woman in Queenstown, Maryland, died Saturday night after a large tree knocked a chimney through the roof of her home, crushing her, according to Kevin Aftung, the chief of emergency Services for Queen Anne's County. New Jersey . -- A woman was killed when floodwater swept away her car, Gov. Chris Christie said Sunday. Christie had said earlier that a firefighter was killed while attempting a water rescue, but later said he was given ""bad information.""

1990,"(CNN) -- The world of sport has paid its tributes to Livorno midfielder Piermario Morosini, who died Saturday after collapsing on the pitch during his side's Serie B game at Pescara. The entire Italian football program this weekend was canceled and a minute's silence was observed at major league games around the world in his honor. A similar tribute was also paid before the start of Sunday's Milan marathon. Tennis player Sara Errani dedicated her victory in the Barcelona Open final to Morosini. ""This tournament is for him,"" Errani told the WTA official website. ""It has been very hard. The images have impacted me a lot. It's amazing that these things can happen. It really makes you think."" Thousands of fans have gathered outside Livorno's Armando Picchi stadium to pay their respects, leaving flowers and scarves. ""You fought until the end, goodbye great Moro,"" read a banner outside the stadium. Morosini dies after collapsing in Serie B game . ""The family, the girlfriend of Piermario and AS Livorno Calcio wants to thank all of the people that in this time of pain have remembered a great athlete and a special person,"" read a statement on the club's official website. The two main Italian sports papers La Gazzetta dello Sport and Corriere dello Sport had the same headline in their Sunday editions. ""Death on the pitch, football stops."" Udinese, who had loaned out Morosini to the second-flight club, pledged to help Morosini's disabled sister. ""We are profoundly in pain for the premature death of Piermario Morosini,"" read a statement on the club's official website. ""Through our non-profit organisation, 'Udinese for life', we will guarantee assistance to the sister of the unfortunate player, who has now been left on her own. "" The 25-year-old Morosini has been at Udinese since 2005, being loaned out to Bologna, then Reggina, Padova, Vicenza and finally Livorno. He made 18 appearances for Italy's under-21s. But his family life had been blighted by tragedy and he lost both his parents before his 18th birthday. His disabled brother later committed suicide to leave him alone with his handicapped elder sister. Pescara's authorities have announced that they will launch an inquiry into Morosini's death. It has emerged that a parked car belonging to traffic police had initially blocked the ambulance's path into the stadium.","Tributes to Italian footballer Piermario Morosini .

1991,"(CNN) -- The young woman battling a flesh-eating bacterial infection in Augusta, Georgia, has taken another step toward recovery: Doctors have upgraded her condition from ""serious"" to ""good."" The change indicates Aimee Copeland's ""vital signs are stable and within normal limits,"" that she is ""conscious and comfortable"" and that indicators are ""excellent,"" Doctors Hospital said in a news release Monday. Copeland, 24, is doing so well that she got into a wheelchair and left her hospital room for the first time Sunday, her father wrote Monday on his blog. ""In your mind's eye, you probably are picturing Aimee grabbing a wheelchair and scooting into it by herself and then rolling herself through doorways and down hallways like some superhuman quad amputee,"" Andy Copeland wrote. ""Dispel such notions. The process of actually sitting up requires the aid of a very good physical therapist, which we are fortunate to have."" Her father wrote that being outside was ""the best therapy she has had in weeks."" Georgia woman with flesh-eating bacteria gets skin graft . Sitting among the pine trees, Andy and Donna Copeland asked their daughter how she really felt about the past 49 days, he wrote. He wasn't expecting the response he got. He wrote that she said she felt ""blessed"" -- not blessed to be alive, but blessed to be different. ""'I mean that I am blessed to have the opportunity to experience something that not many other people have the chance to experience,'"" Copeland wrote, recalling his daughter's words. ""'I am blessed to be able to have a challenge that not many others get to have. I am blessed to have the capacity to share my experience with others and have a chance to improve the quality of someone else's life. I'm blessed to be different.'"" Aimee Copeland's ordeal began May 1, when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta. The line snapped, and she fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room. Doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. The bacteria led surgeons to amputate most of her hands, part of her abdomen, one of her legs and her remaining foot in an effort to stay ahead of the infection. She has also had multiple skin grafts. Her father has written regularly since about her situation, with over 78,000 ""likes"" on his Facebook blog devoted to Aimee's fight. A number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to the condition. When the bacteria gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. The infection attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities.

1992,"(CNN) -- The weather in St. Pete Beach had been bad all day, so Laura Miller and Brenda Pace hunkered down to watch a baseball game on television. But conditions outside Sunday night quickly went from bad to worse, they said Monday, as Tropical Storm Debby spawned a suspected tornado. ""The winds started picking up,"" Miller said. ""We heard the proverbial noise -- the train -- the transformer blew, the windows started busting out. It was just very chaotic, all the glass flying, the debris flying into the house. It was pretty intense."" They looked for a place to hide, but the door to their ground-floor bathroom wouldn't open. ""We managed to get between the refrigerator and the pantry area and just ride it out,"" Miller said. A suspected waterspout may have roared ashore and become a tornado in their neighborhood, the Pass-A-Grille area of St. Pete Beach, according to CNN affiliate WFLA. Pace said she was still in shock, but ""it's amazing we got out without a scratch."" Two people had minor injuries, said St. Pete Beach Fire Marshal Ernest Hand. Eight properties in the area sustained major damage and 24 had minor damage. ""We were lucky,"" he said. ""It was so windy and rainy, I couldn't go outside to look,"" resident Michael Hamm told WFLA. ""Ten or 15 minutes later, when I did, I noticed the roof was gone over the deck, the picnic tables had blown off, the railing was gone, the electricity was off. ... We didn't get hurt, so we're very lucky."" Elsewhere in Florida, one person was killed in an apparent tornado on Sunday, officials said. Debby remained offshore Monday but continued to pose a threat of tornadoes, heavy rain, additional flooding and high winds to much of Florida as it slogged slowly to the northeast. Floridians were warned the rain may stick around through the week in some areas. A few tornadoes were possible Monday across the eastern Florida Panhandle, the Florida peninsula and southern Georgia, forecasters said. A large swath of Florida was under a tornado watch until Monday afternoon. Numerous flood watches and warnings were also posted. As of 1 p.m. Monday, Debby was centered about 50 miles south-southwest of Apalachicola in the Florida Panhandle, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm had weakened slightly, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. However, tropical-storm-force winds -- those 39 mph or stronger -- extended 230 miles out from its center, mainly to the southeast. ""Debby is a large tropical cyclone, with the strongest winds and much of the heaviest rainfall well removed from the center of circulation,"" the hurricane center said. After being nearly stationary overnight, Debby began inching northeast Monday at about 5 mph. ""Tropical storm conditions will continue over portions of the Florida Gulf Coast today,"" forecasters said. Debby is expected to dump a total of 10 to 20 inches of rain over northern and central Florida, with 25 inches possible in some areas, forecasters said. A total of about 5 to 15 inches of rain is possible across coastal southeastern Georgia and extreme southeastern South Carolina, according to the hurricane center. Total rain accumulations of 5 to 10 inches are expected over central Florida and southeast Georgia into coastal South Carolina, with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches possible, forecasters said. CNN iReporters sent pictures and video of flooding in their areas. Magalie Caragiorgio said Monday she has been stuck in her New Port Richey, Florida, home since Sunday because of flooding and hasn't been able to get to her job as a nurse. ""It's unnerving because you can't do anything,"" she said. ""I guess I wasn't prepared. I wasn't expecting to be flooded out like this."" In Wilton Manors, Florida, ""the flooding cut off access to everyone's homes until it subsided,"" said iReporter Jon Carson. ""... I have a small car so I was terrified about how I was going to get the kids to school."" In Panama City, some tourists stuck around to ride out the storm, said iReporter and restaurant employee Michael Dunning. ""Usually people pack up and leave when they hear about a storm,"" he said. ""It was just another storm, lots of wind and rain."" Chris Anuszkiewicz of Clearwater, Florida, said water came through his garage and front door. ""I've been through hurricanes on the beach here, and the rain from this was more intense,"" he said. The U.S. Coast Guard in Mobile said it rescued a family that became stranded on Dog Island, south of Carrabelle, Florida, by weather associated with Debby. The Coast Guard said Monday it received a phone call about 12:30 p.m. Sunday from a man saying his family, including five adults, four children and two dogs, was stranded in a vacation house located on a narrow sandbar on southwest Dog Island. ""Water was reportedly surrounding the house, and there was no way for them to evacuate to higher ground,"" the Coast Guard said in a statement. ""The commercial vessel that brought the family to the island would not come back for them due to the weather conditions from the storm."" The Coast Guard dispatched a helicopter and rescue crew, which were able to evacuate the family. All those rescued were examined by medics and found to be uninjured. Citing the threat of heavy rainfall and potential tornadoes, Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Monday declared a state of emergency ""so we can coordinate the use of all state resources to make sure we can respond promptly if anything happens."" He warned residents to expect ""a significant amount of rain."" Pinellas County also declared a state of local emergency on Monday, officials said. Crews in Sarasota County were assessing flooding, and the county was asking residents to reduce their water usage, as its water reclamation facilities were ""reaching treatment capacity,"" said county spokeswoman Crystal Pruitt. The hurricane center narrowed the warning area for Debby on Monday. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Florida Gulf Coast stretching from Destin to Englewood, Florida. The storm was expected to continue moving slowly northeast or east-northeast over the next couple of days, forecasters said. Little change in strength was expected. A revised forecast track showed Debby remaining a tropical storm until it makes landfall early Thursday near Apalachee Bay, Florida -- in the bend of the state where the Florida Panhandle ends. The storm is then expected to cross the state of Florida and head into the Atlantic Ocean south of Jacksonville as a tropical depression on Saturday. Seminole, Florida, received more than 10 inches of rain on Sunday, according to preliminary 24-hour totals from the National Weather Service. Pinellas Park, Florida, received nearly 9 inches, and the Apalachicola, Florida, airport received 8.65 inches, according to the weather service. The Ocala, Florida, airport measured nearly 8 inches. Other preliminary rainfall totals included 6.68 inches in Wakulla, Florida; 6.58 inches in Orange Springs, Florida; and 6.27 inches in St. Petersburg. On Sunday, two apparent twisters destroyed four homes in Florida's Highland County, said Gloria Rybinski, emergency operations spokeswoman for the county. A woman was found dead in a home in Venus, located in the middle of the state between Port St. Lucie and Sarasota, Rybinski said. About 35,000 people statewide were without power, Bryan Koon, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, told reporters. ""That number is going to fluctuate as we go through this week,"" he said. Follow Bay News 9's live blog . The Sunshine Skyway bridge, which stretches over Tampa Bay and connects Bradenton with St. Petersburg, Florida, was closed Sunday because of high winds and remained closed Monday, Pinellas County officials said. Winds in the area have been clocked at 20 to 30 mph with higher gusts, according to CNN affiliate Bay News 9. Seas were between 12 and 15 feet. Residents of a Tampa retirement home were evacuated Monday, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said. The Sunrise Village Retirement Home ""is located in an area that is prone to flooding and the water is up to the building right now,"" authorities said in a statement Monday morning. About 90 residents were being moved to other Sunrise Village facilities, the sheriff's office said. Debby's effects were being felt as far north as Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. CNN iReporter Greg Dee was on the beach when one of Debby's rain bands passed through. ""It began picking up sand and you could actually see it moving down the beach with the wind,"" he said. ""It felt like my legs were being sandblasted."" Video from the Tampa area showed drivers inching through water on a flooded street Sunday night, with at least one stranded. The floodwaters were beginning to recede Monday morning, but several stalled cars remained on flooded roadways, CNN affiliate WTSP reported. Forecasters warned the combination of a storm surge and the tide would cause coastal areas to be inundated with water. An area from Apalachee Bay to Waccasassa Bay, Florida, could see a 3- to 5-foot surge, while Florida's west coast south of Waccasassa Bay could see 1 to 3 feet. An area stretching from southeastern Louisiana to Apalachee Bay, Florida could get a 1- to 3-foot surge, according to the hurricane center. Officials in Alabama and Louisiana have said they are monitoring Debby's progress, given uncertainty regarding its path. The storm has raised concerns for those working on 596 manned oil and gas production platforms throughout the Gulf, run by various companies. Shell said Sunday that it had evacuated 360 staff members the previous day and was planning further evacuations. However, given the forecast shift that showed Debby steering clear of Louisiana, Shell said Monday it was in the process of redeploying staff. ""By end of day Tuesday, we will be back to normal operations across the Gulf,"" the company said. ExxonMobil said Sunday it had ""evacuated nonessential personnel"" from its offshore facilities and was preparing to evacuate the rest. And BP spokesman Brett Clanton said Sunday evening that the company has evacuated the ""majority of our offshore personnel in the Gulf of Mexico"" due to Debby. ""Those unable to be evacuated will shelter in place for the storm,"" he said. CNN's Sarah Dillingham, Meridith Edwards, Kim Segal and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","NEW: Widespread flooding is reported in Florida .

1993,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Authorities declined to file criminal charges Wednesday against a fifth-grade student for the death of 10-year-old Joanna Ramos, who suffered fatal blunt force head trauma after a fistfight in February. ""This case was a fight between two children that ended with unintended and tragic results,"" according to a statement by Long Beach Police. Joanna, a fifth-grader at Willard Elementary School, died six hours after an altercation with an unidentified 11-year-old female classmate, said Sgt. Rico Fernandez, a Long Beach Police spokesman. Authorities had ruled her death a homicide. ""Detectives presented all of the facts and evidence of the investigation to The Los Angeles District Attorney's office for review,"" the statement read. ""They determined that they would not file any charges in the case."" Long Beach authorities declined further comment about the case. In February, police said, Joanna and her classmate had challenged each other to a planned fight when their school session ended. ""The two girls met in a nearby alley next to a church and began hitting each other,"" Fernandez said. The fight lasted less than a minute, and no weapons were involved, he said. CNN affiliate KABC reported that friends of Joanna's believed the fight occurred over a boy. According to Long Beach Unified School District spokesman Chris Eftychiou, Joanna finished her regular school session at 2:12 p.m. on February 24 and was supposed to remain on campus to begin her scheduled after-school program at 2:30. ""We believe the altercation occurred during that 15-minute window because she apparently left and returned for the after-school session, which involves help with homework and academic-related activity,"" Eftychiou said. After the fight, the girls went their separate ways, he said. Joanna stayed in the afternoon session for about an hour but did not exhibit obvious signs of physical trauma, Eftychiou said. ""When she did complain of not feeling well, her cousin picked her up, but we had no indication she was involved in an altercation,"" he said. ""Only when she was at the hospital did we get word about the altercation."" Joanna had been enrolled at the school for about a year and a half, Eftychiou said. Los Angeles district attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons confirmed the findings issued by the Long Beach Police Department but declined further comment because the case involved minors. ""The Long Beach Police Department hopes that its conclusion brings some peace to both families involved, as well as the community,"" the statement said.","Joanna Ramos suffered head injury during a fight in February, then died .

1994,"(CNN) -- After ruining Memorial Day plans along the Florida and Georgia coasts, the remnants of Tropical Storm Beryl are forecast to bring more rain to the Carolinas. The National Hurricane Center said Monday evening it expects the storm to move over the southern portions of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina over the next 48 hours. As of 5 p.m. Monday, Beryl, downgraded to a tropical depression, was centered about 10 miles east of Valdosta, Georgia, and about 150 miles southwest of Savannah. Beryl's maximum sustained winds Monday evening were near 30 mph, down 5 mph from Monday morning, and the hurricane center said there will be little change in strength over the coming days. It was still producing lots of rain and creating dangerous surf conditions, including rip currents, along the coast from northeastern Florida to North Carolina, the hurricane center said. Beryl made landfall just after midnight Sunday near Jacksonville Beach, Florida. It brought more than 5 inches or rain to Palm Coast, Florida, just south of Jacksonville, according to the local National Weather Service Forecast Office. There were media reports of 6 inches in the Jacksonville neighborhood of Arlington and reports of more than 4 inches in a neighborhood farther south, the forecast office said. Other areas reported more than three inches of rain. Beryl also produced a small tornado Monday afternoon near Port St. Lucie, Florida, the forecast office said. The twister caused roof damage and downed some trees and power lines. Couple ties the knot as Beryl comes ashore . The storm caused Jacksonville Mayor Alvin Brown to cancel all Memorial Day ceremonies. A Memorial Day event at the Veterans Cemetery in nearby St. Augustine also was canceled, CNN affiliate WTLV reported. The Jacksonville Transportation Authority suspended all bus routes to area beaches. Twelve flights scheduled to leave Jacksonville were canceled Monday, according to the Jacksonville Aviation Authority. The storm's powerful winds also knocked out power across the region and roads and bridges to close. Beryl cut short weekend plans for hundreds of campers and day-trippers to Georgia's Cumberland Island National Seashore as they were ordered to leave ahead of the storm, the National Park Service said. Beryl was the second named storm of the year, preceding the June 1 official start of the Atlantic hurricane season. It never became a hurricane, peaking only as a tropical storm over the weekend. A storm surge and high tide could cause coastal flooding of up to 2 feet along the coasts of Georgia and Florida, according to the hurricane center. Beryl is expected to dump 4 to 8 inches of rain along parts of the Southeastern coast, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches. Though it wrecked holiday plans, Beryl is bringing much needed rain to the area, most of which is experiencing an ""extreme"" or ""exceptional"" drought, according to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which tracks drought conditions nationwide.

1995,"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The bodies of five more people killed when the Costa Concordia cruise ship sank were found Thursday, bringing to 30 the number of bodies located, Italian officials said. Two of the roughly 4,200 originally aboard the cruise liner remain missing. The Costa Concordia, a ship belonging to cruise line Costa Crociere, struck rocks off the island of Giglio on January 13 with about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members on board. Workers completed the removal of 2,400 tons of oil from the ship's tanks this week, a delicate process that began five weeks ago, the ship's owner said Thursday. Luxury cruise ship collides with container vessel . A salvage company will be selected next month to move the ship, a task that could take a year, according to the statement from Costa Crociere. Divers who located the three bodies Thursday were not able to immediately determine age or sex of the victims, according to Piero De Milito, an official with Italy's Civil Protection Coordination department. ""The bodies were found on the exterior side of the wreck facing the island, between the wreck and the rocks,"" De Milito said. ""In the next 48 hours, we'll be able to bring them on the mainland."" Crews used 20 vessels, including platforms, tugs, transport ships, crane barges and tankers, to defuel the cruise ship, which remains on its side. While the oil has been removed, the ""caretaking"" operation to clean the seabed and monitor the ship will continue for several months, the company said. The cruise line will choose next month which of six bidding salvage companies will remove the wrecked ship. ""The operation to remove the wreck will be a particularly complex one and is expected to take from 10 to 12 months, depending on which tender is chosen,"" the company said.

1996,"(CNN) -- Authorities detained a man who tried to open the door of a commercial jet midair on Thursday, officials said. US Airways Flight 3801 made an unscheduled landing at Boston's Logan Airport, where Massachusetts State Police boarded the plane and took the unruly passenger into custody, State Trooper Thomas Murphy said. The flight, operated by Air Wisconsin, was flying from Portland, Maine, to Philadelphia when the incident occurred. There were 50 passengers and three crew members onboard, the airline said. The passenger ""seemed to be disoriented"" when he tried to open a cabin door on the CRJ-200 aircraft, Air Wisconsin spokeswoman Annette Daly said in a statement. Daly said a flight attendant subdued the passenger, but Phil Orlandella, a spokesman for Massport, said other passengers restrained him. Opening the doors of most commercial jets while in flight is nearly impossible due to the air pressure and design of the doors.

1997,"(CNN) -- A historic site in China's former capital that dates back more than 600 years to the Ming Dynasty was damaged Sunday after a Ferrari raced across it before a publicity event for the Italian carmaker, the official Xinhua news agency said. The Ferrari 458 Italia sped around the ramparts of the ancient city walls in Nanjing, leaving thick black tread marks that cleaners were unable to remove, an exhibition of driving that aired on state television before being circulated on the Internet. In a statement issued Tuesday, Ferrari China said the drive was taken unauthorized by staff from its Nanjing distributor Nanjing Kuaiyi Automobile Trading Co. Ltd, which was planning to hold a new car exhibition in the area. City authorities said the car was intended to be part of a ceremony on Monday to mark the 20th anniversary of the luxury car automaker's entry into China's luxury car market. Ferrari expressed ""deep regret"" for what it described as an ""accident,"" calling it ""unacceptable"" and saying it would take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening again. It stated it has ""always held great respect toward Chinese traditional culture and regards the protection of historical relics as of great importance."" Qinhuai district tourism bureau said its officials had been reprimanded, while the Nanjing Municipal Administration of Cultural Heritage said the use of the site was not approved by archeological authorities, Xinhua said. The incident also dismayed some Chinese netizens, who expressed their misgivings about the partnership between Ferrari and the city authorities. Weibo user Dayushenying called the incident ""shameful,"" off rumors that Ferrari had paid 80,000 yuan to use the city walls, without regard for cultural relics. Weibo user bobisaman commented wryly: ""Ferrari put out the cash, Nanjing put out the city walls. In the end, Nanjing won because Ferrari helped advertise it globally.""

1998,"(CNN) -- Firefighters extinguished a blaze in a nuclear submarine early Thursday at a U.S. Navy shipyard in Maine after battling it for hours, according to a statement released by the shipyard. Seven people were injured and were treated either on the scene or at ""a local medical facility,"" the statement from the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard read. Among those injured were three firefighters from the shipyard, two ship crew members and two civilian firefighters, who assisted the Navy's fire crew. Vacuum cleaner blamed for fire on nuclear submarine . The USS Miami's reactor was not operating at any time the fire broke out and remained unaffected and stable throughout, said Capt. Bryant Fuller, commander for the shipyard, which is in Kittery, Maine. The sub was in dock at the shipyard when the blaze began, where it has been ""since early March for an overhaul."" Firefighters first responded to the fire at 5:41 p.m. ET Wednesday. The fire started in a forward part of the ship away from the reactor, affecting ""primarily living areas and command and control spaces,"" Fuller said. ""The nuclear propulsion spaces were physically isolated early in the event from the forward compartment fire,"" according to the statement. The USS Miami is capable of carrying Tomahawk cruise missiles and Mark 48 torpedoes. No weapons were on board, Fuller said. State, local and federal authorities were notified of the incident. ""The cause of the fire is not known at this time,"" Fuller said. ""A full investigation will be conducted.""

1999,"(CNN) -- The first U.S. case of mad cow disease in six years sparked fears of illness that prompted two South Korean retailers to suspend the sale of American beef. However, public health officials said the risk of Americans contracting the disease is low, given that the affected dairy cow in central California never entered the human food chain and did not contract bovine spongiform encephalopathy through contaminated animal feed. ""It was never presented for slaughter for human consumption, so at no time presented a risk to the food supply or human health,"" said John Clifford, the Agriculture Department's chief veterinarian. What you need to know about mad cow disease . In South Korea, one of the world's largest importers of U.S. beef, the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy led retailer LotteMart to remove American beef from store shelves. ""Currently, the sale of U.S. beef is temporarily suspended to ease our customers from anxiety,"" LotteMart said. The South Korean government said it will step up checks on U.S. beef imports but not halt them for now. In 2010, South Korea imported 125,000 tons of U.S. beef, a 97% increase from the year before, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. Sarah Klein, food safety attorney for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said there is no need for consumers to take precautions based on this case. ""A case of a single cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy is not a reason for significant concern on the part of consumers, and there is no reason to believe the beef or milk supply is unsafe,"" she said. ""If the cow were exposed to the typical strain of BSE via animal feed -- and the government says that's not the case here -- that would have represented a significant failure,"" she said. She said the government would have had a difficult time tracking down other cattle that may have been eating the same feed because the nation lacks an effective animal identification program. Elisa Odabashian, the director of the West Coast office of Consumers Union, said the government's testing program is not sufficient to ensure that U.S. beef is safe. ""The USDA tests only about 40,000 of the 35 million cows that are killed every year,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""That's just a tiny fraction. ... They're not looking very hard for mad cow disease, and so they're not finding it very often."" In a statement issued to CNN in 2006, the USDA said it does not support 100% testing because the disease is difficult to detect in young cattle, the primary source of beef in the United States. ""Recognizing the international scientific consensus that BSE (Mad Cow Disease) is a disease that is not detected in young animals, there isn't any nation in the world that requires 100-percent testing for BSE,"" the statement said. But Odabashian said the agency has also vetoed efforts by private companies to carry out their own testing, at their own expense, and then labeling their product as BSE-free. ""Those companies in the United States that want to test their own meat have been prohibited from doing so by the USDA,"" she said. ""We think that's wrong."" The cow's carcass was at a Baker Commodities Inc. rendering facility in Hanford, California, according to company Executive Vice President Dennis Luckey. The company renders animal byproducts and had randomly selected the animal for testing on April 18, he said. ""We are in the business of removing dead animals from dairies in the Central Valley,"" he said. ""As part of that program, we participate in the BSE surveillance program."" The sample was sent to the University of California at Davis for initial testing, which came back inconclusive. It was then sent to the Department of Agriculture's laboratory in Ames, Iowa, where it tested positive, the agency said. The carcass was in quarantine Wednesday. ""We're waiting now for USDA to tell us how to dispose of it,"" Luckey said. A USDA spokesman, Larry Hawkins, said the agency was not releasing the name of the dairy ""because it's our policy not to when we are in the middle of the investigation."" But Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, said it was from a dairy farm in Tulare County. ""We did trace it back to a farm,"" Nunes said, adding that the discovery ""demonstrates the strength of our surveillance system."" In a statement, California Department of Food and Agriculture Secretary Karen Ross said CDFA veterinarians were working with the USDA to determine whether other cows are at risk. ""Feed restrictions in place in California and around the country for the last 15 years minimize that risk to the greatest degree possible,"" she said. Eating contaminated meat or some other animal products from cattle that have BSE is thought to be the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The fatal brain disease was blamed for the deaths of 150 people in Britain, where there was an outbreak in the 1980s and 1990s. Learn more about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . In people, symptoms of the disease include psychiatric and behavioral changes, movement deficits, memory disturbances and cognitive impairments. BSE can cause infected animals to display nervousness or aggression, difficulty in coordination and standing up, decreased milk production or weight loss. It is usually transmitted between cows through the practice of recycling bovine carcasses for meat and bone meal protein, which is fed to other cattle. In this case, the Agricultural Department reported that the cow had a rare form of BSE not likely carried by contaminated feed. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Monday that he remains confident in the health of the national herd and the safety of beef and dairy products. ""This is an atypical case, which means it's not connected in any way, shape or form to feed. ... A very rare circumstance and situation,"" Vilsack said. ""It can just sort of come up and pop up -- sometimes it's genetic."" Since 2004, the USDA has removed the brain and the spinal column, the parts suspected of causing mad cow disease in humans, from the food system. Unlike most other meat-borne illnesses, such as those caused by E.-coli bacteria, cooking does not kill the infectious agent that causes mad cow disease. Consumers who wish to exercise extra caution can follow the advice presented by the Web-based consumer advocacy group Consumeraffairs.com, which advises the avoidance of brains, neck bones and beef cheeks, bone marrow and cuts of beef that are sold on the bone. The group also says to choose boneless cuts of meat and ground beef only if it has been ground in the store. ""Evidence shows that our systems and safeguards to prevent BSE are working, as are similar actions taken by countries around the world,"" said the USDA's Clifford. Last year, 29 cases of BSE were reported worldwide, down 99% from the peak of 37,311 cases in 1992. ""This is directly attributable to the impact and effectiveness of feed bans as a primary control measure for the disease,"" he said. The Agriculture Department confirmed the first case of mad cow disease in America on December 23, 2003, in a cow born in Alberta, Canada, in April 1997, only four months before the United States and Canada began banning the use of brain and spinal cord tissue in cattle feed. A second U.S. case was confirmed June 24, 2005, and a third on March 13, 2006. The infected California cow confirmed Tuesday was America's fourth case of mad cow disease.
