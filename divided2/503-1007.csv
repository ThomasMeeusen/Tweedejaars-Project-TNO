503,"(CNN) -- An autopsy has been completed on former Olympian and UNC track coach Antonio Pettigrew, but reports from the examination are pending and the cause of his death has not been released, the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said Wednesday. The body of Pettigrew, a former 400-meter world champion who returned his gold medal after he admitted doping, was found in the back seat of his car early Tuesday, according to the Chatham County, North Carolina, Sheriff's Office. Pettigrew, 42, was an assistant track coach at the University of North Carolina. His friends were looking for him after he failed to show up for work, authorities said. ""They attempted to retrace his route to work and shortly afterwards found him unresponsive in the back seat of his 2008 white Dodge Aspen on a bridge on U.S. 751."" Deputies responded to the call about 3:15 a.m. ""and found he was deceased with no apparent trauma,"" the statement said. ""There were indications that Pettigrew may have taken the sleep aid Unisom, but it is still unclear if this caused his death."" Pettigrew's body was taken to a hospital, and the medical examiner ordered an autopsy, police said. The autopsy was completed Tuesday, said Sharon Artis of the medical examiner's office. Pettigrew's wife had also reported him missing, and deputies in Wake County had responded to the couple's Apex, North Carolina, home, authorities said. He had last been heard from about 10:30 a.m. on Monday, the statement said. Pettigrew won gold at the 1991 world championships in Tokyo, Japan, and was a member of the American 4x400 squad that won a gold medal for a relay in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. However, in 2008 Pettigrew admitted being part of a systematic doping program organized by former coach Trevor Graham between 1997 and 2003. Members of the relay squad were stripped of their medals. Pettigrew was in his fourth season at UNC, where he led the university's sprinters, hurdlers and relay teams, according to the UNC Athletics website. ""Although we are still learning the circumstances, we are deeply saddened to learn of Antonio's death,"" UNC athletic director Dick Baddour said Tuesday in a statement on the website. ""I was particularly impressed with his student-athletes and the pride he took in representing the University of North Carolina. Our deepest condolences go out to Antonio's family, particularly his wife and son.""","NEW: Autopsy is complete, but final reports are still pending .

504,"(CNN) -- A mother in Louisville, Kentucky, has died after saving her three children and two nieces by pushing them out the second-story window of her burning townhome. Bystanders who noticed the flames helped catch the children as Tomarra Finley guided them out on Thursday morning. After the five children were rescued, Finley, 31, was found unconscious by firefighters. They gave her oxygen and CPR, but she died later of smoke inhalation. Fire Capt. Salvador Melendez said Finley braved tremendous heat and smoke in saving the children. ""It was even extreme for us, and we wear all this gear,"" he told CNN affiliate WDRB-TV of Louisville. ""We can only imagine what she went through. She did a brave thing. She made a sacrifice, but she did indeed save those children."" Karey Hudson said he saw a child hanging out the window and ran to help. He said a man delivering newspapers came running up and told the child to jump. ""'One of us will catch you,"" Hudson said the paper man told the child. Firefighters said that smoke alarms alerted Finley to the fire.","Tomarra Finley, 31, dies rescuing five children from a burning townhome .

505,"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A dozen Australian swimmers have fallen ill at the beleaguered Commonwealth Games in India, officials say. The swimmers are reporting a higher percentage of diarrhea than other athletes at the games, said an Australian official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Two Australian swimmers have withdrawn. ""The Commonwealth Games Federation chief, Mike Fennell, asked at a press conference Thursday that immediate tests be conducted on all pools. The organizing committee conducted the tests and have come back and said the water quality in all pools is clear,"" said an official with the Commonwealth Games Federation, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. When asked whether there was a problem with the food, he said: ""We are confident the food in the games village is up to international standards. Since September 12, more than 700 tests have been conducted on the food and all independent tests have passed with flying colors."" The federation is exploring what else could have sickened the athletes. The illnesses threaten to further mar the games, which have been widely criticized. Organizers scrambled to pull together the event after a pedestrian bridge at a stadium collapsed last month and officials called accommodations at the athletes' village uninhabitable and filthy. It's the first time India has hosted the international sporting event between countries of the former British Empire. The games, held every four years, include many Olympic events and other sports traditionally played in those countries. The games gave India an opportunity to promote a shiny image as an emerging power. The government spent billions on a new international airport, additional metro lines and fresh landscaping along dingy Delhi roads. Problems piled up before the games, however. Last month, gunmen fired on a tourist bus in New Delhi and injured two Taiwanese tourists. A car blaze turned out to be a crudely manufactured bomb. And a militant group warned that it planned to target the games. Indian law enforcement authorities responded with a heightened security plan, placing thousands of extra forces on the streets of the capital. Two world-class athletes canceled their trips, citing security and health concerns. Entire teams threatened to do the same, while others delayed their arrival date. Elena Baltacha, a tennis player picked to represent Scotland at the games, pulled out. ""I am incredibly disappointed, because I was really excited about playing for Scotland, but conditions in Delhi are such that going there would pose too high a risk to my health,"" she said at the time. India remains a developing country with millions of poor people, and risks such as dengue fever. On Monday, doctors confirmed a case of dengue fever in an official with the Indian lawn bowls team at the Commonwealth Games. The 30-year-old man could have contracted the disease from outside the athletes' village in New Delhi. He had complained of feeling sick a day after arriving at the athletes village last month, said a spokesman for the G.B. Pant Hospital in the city. Dengue is the most common virus transmitted by mosquitoes in the world. It causes as many as 100 million infections and kills 25,000 people every year. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas, according to the World Health Organization.","A dozen Australian swimmers have been sickened .

506,"(CNN) -- The Transport Ministry in Ghana has downplayed an incident involving two commercial jets at its main airport on Monday night which some media reports have described as a plane crash. Officials at the Kotoka International Airport say two airplanes, Lufthansa Flight 567 and Turkish Airlines Flight 624, tipped at the wings on the tarmac as the latter prepared to taxi for takeoff. According to Deputy Transport Minister Dzifa Ativor, the official version of events as she gathered after meeting officials of the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority and the Airport Company Tuesday morning suggests an ""incident"". ""It wasn't a crash, it was an incident. The 'crash,' I think was too harsh a word to use,"" she said. The accident has however raised questions about the ability of the airport to accommodate the several airlines that are being licensed by the Aviation Authority. Commercial oil production in Ghana is due to begin in the coming months, attracting more investors and other visitors. But Ativor, the deputy transport minister, said a project to expand the airport to enable it to admit bigger planes is under way. She disagreed that the incident could be the result of overcrowding. She added, ""the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority has set up investigations and they will be submitting a report to the ministry as early as possible. After that we will forward it to the accident investigation board to do an in-depth investigation so that we'll take steps to forestall recurrence of such incidents."" The minister says the Turkish Airline flight, which was grounded temporarily as a result of the incident, eventually took off and has since arrived safely at its destination. The Lufthansa flight was also suspended. But the airline's manager for Ghana, Yannick Aplogan, said the aircraft has since been certified as airworthy and will take off at 8:35 p.m. (3:35 p.m. ET) Tuesday. ""Our aircraft was in the parking position when the aircraft from Turkish Airlines which was taxing to the runway hit the winglet of our aircraft,"" Aplogan said. He added that, ""based on our internal processes we decided to cancel the flight to make further technical checks"". According to him there was no extensive physical damage apart from a dent at the point of impact. As many as 30 airlines including, United, Delta and Virgin Atlantic, operate from the Kotoka International Airport in the capital Accra. Turkish Airlines is one of the new airlines to have started operations from the Accra airport and there are more expected to commence before the end of the year. The Kotoka International Airport is known to have one of the safest air corridors in sub-Saharan Africa.","""It wasn't a crash, it was an incident,"" transport official says of Monday mishap .

507,"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai police Wednesday linked a powerful explosion at a suburban Bangkok apartment building to anti-government protesters. The death toll from Tuesday's blast grew to four as investigators recovered an unidentified body from the debris at the site, the country's emergency center said. Nine people also were injured. Initial forensic evidence suggests the bomb was made from about 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of TNT and was being assembly at the apartment before it exploded, according to Gen. Wichean Potephosri, the national police chief, who said evidence found at the scene may link it to four other recent bombings. The country's Crime Suppression Bureau said the room where investigators believe the bomb was assembled was rented by an anti-government supporter from Chiang Mai, who is wanted on an arrest warrant in another bombing case. Tuesday's blast damaged the first and second floors of the Saman Meta Apartment building in Nonthaburi province, just outside the capital, Bang Bua Thong police said. The building has been sealed off while police collect forensic evidence, but authorities have said there is evidence of an explosive material at the site. The anti-government protesters are known as ""Red Shirts"" -- so named for the color of their clothing. On Tuesday, the Thai government extended an emergency decree in Bangkok and three provinces has been extended. The decree allows authorities to detain suspects without formal charges up to 90 days. The emergency rule was imposed in April after anti-government protests crippled much of Thailand. The extension of the emergency rule also come after another protest in September where more than 10,000 anti-government demonstrators gathered in the heart of Bangkok's shopping district to mark the fourth anniversary of a bloodless coup that ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. That peaceful demonstration lasted about four hours as one of the city's main intersections was again flooded with ""Red Shirt"" demonstrators. But that demonstration was a far cry from the bloody protests where Red Shirts amassed in the same area from March to May until a crackdown by the government's security forces left 91 people dead and more than 2,000 injured.","Police point to anti-government protesters in bomb blast .

509,"(CNN) -- A collision between a bus and a train in the Ukraine on Tuesday left 42 people dead and nine others injured, officials said. The crash took place when a commuter bus and a railway locomotive collided in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, according to Ukraine's Emergency Situations Ministry. The accident occurred at an unguarded train crossing near the village of Maksimovka on the stretch between the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, the ministry said. According to preliminary information, the bus was carrying 51 people as it was driving over the crossing. Are you there? Share your photos and  videos . Railway officials told Ukrainian news agencies that the crossing was closed for cars, and the warning lights were on. A preliminary investigation showed that the bus driver ignored the warning light signals and violated safety rules by crossing the passage when the train was approaching it, the officials told local agencies. The driver of the train survived, but it was not immediately known if he was injured. President Viktor Yanukovych expressed his condolences for the victims' families and declared Wednesday a national day of mourning, according to the president's press office. The government will pay 100,000 Ukrainian hyrvnas (about U.S. $12,600) to the victims' families, according to the emergency ministry.","NEW: Ukrainian president declares national day of mourning .

510,"Oviedo, Florida (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday awarded the Medal of Honor -- the nation's highest military decoration -- to Staff Sgt. Robert J. Miller, a Green Beret who died after willingly taking fire to protect U.S. and Afghan soldiers. The citation read at a solemn White House ceremony in Washington, D.C., honored Miller for ""conspicuous gallantry ... at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty"" and ""extraordinary acts of heroism"" on January 25, 2008, when a patrol he led was ambushed in Afghanistan. Miller killed at least 10 insurgents and wounded dozens more in repeatedly exposing himself to enemy fire ""in keeping with the highest traditions of military service,"" the citation said. Miller is the seventh service member to receive the Medal of Honor for actions during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama gave a detailed account of the combat in which Miller was killed, describing how the small group of U.S. and Afghan soldiers came under fire in a narrow valley from protected enemy positions above. Realizing the peril of the situation, Miller ordered his team to fall back, but then ""did something extraordinary,"" Obama said. ""Rob moved the other way, toward the insurgents,"" to draw their fire so his team could back off safely, the president said. The others could hear Miller firing and calling out enemy positions amid overwhelming enemy fire, Obama said. ""Then over the radio, they heard his voice,"" Obama continued. ""He had been hit. But still he kept calling out enemy positions, still he kept firing, still he kept hurling grenades. Then they heard it. Rob's weapon fell silent."" Five members of his team were wounded, Obama said, but all survived. He quoted one of the survivors as saying, ""I would not be alive today if not for his ultimate sacrifice."" Some of the dozen team members at the ceremony were red-eyed when Obama asked them to stand, and the president cited them and all U.S. fighting forces in Afghanistan for their commitment to the mission of preventing the country from again becoming a haven for terrorists to launch attacks on the United States. ""Every American is safer because of their service, and every American has a duty to remember and honor their sacrifice,"" Obama said. Miller's parents, Maureen and Philip Miller, stood onstage with Obama as the citation was read. They earlier told how they take consolation that their son gave his life so others could live. ""If it wasn't for Robert's actions, they could have easily been killed,"" Maureen Miller said. Miller's father added: ""We have a sense of awe and amazement of what he did and a feeling of pride."" Sgt. James Lodyga, Miller's commander in Afghanistan, described the battle in the village of Barikowt, near the Pakistani border, as being like ""fish in a barrel."" ""Enemy on right, on the left. Robby immediately started firing,"" Lodyga said. An Army commendation noted the young man's character. ""Only 24 years old, Miller impressed everyone on his team. Although the youngest member of A Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group [Airborne], Fort Bragg, N.C., he quickly earned a reputation for taking on difficult challenges,"" the Army said. His mother relayed a perspective only a parent could have. ""I'm feeling humbled by it,"" Maureen Miller said. ""He was just our kid, not too long out of the annoying teenager stage, and he was doing all this."" She had a notion, though, of her son's outlook on life. ""Robert wore his favorite shirt which said, 'Cowards die many time before their death. The valiant never taste of death but once,' "" she said. The fallen soldier's sister, Nancy, pointed out that ""he was always concerned about looking out for others."" Lodyga said Miller did just that. ""Robby was shot in the side and he shot those who shot him,"" the sergeant said. ""He kept firing until he succumbed to a shot under the armpit. I don't know how to put it into words. I know Robby saved our lives, Absolutely he's a hero. I thank him a lot."" The Medal of Honor is given for exceptional acts of gallantry, ""bravery or self-sacrifice"" and must involve risk of life, the White House said. At Miller's home in Oviedo, Florida, his parents fly the U.S. flag -- and display two stars in a window. ""The blue star flag is anyone in active service. Gold star is designation that they are fallen in battle,"" Philip Miller said. ""They are in memory of our son and a proud memorial for him."" For Miller's parents, Wednesday's ceremony at the White House was an important step on the long road to healing. The parents were told at his funeral more than two years ago that the decorated Green Beret would be receiving another commendation. ""There was a sense that it wasn't finished and that there was something left to be done,"" Maureen Miller said. ""Now this part of the chapter will be closed."" The slain warrior's mother said she was looking forward to ""finally getting it over with and a sense of closure. We will always miss Rob and there will always be a hole in our heart.""

511,"(CNN) -- A 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck Friday night 41 km (26 miles) north-northwest of San Jose, Costa Rica, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Journalist Djenane Villanueva in San Jose told CNN she felt the earthquake, that it was long, but that she had not received any immediate reports of damage or injuries. The incident occurred at 7:54 p.m. (9:54 p.m. ET) at a depth of 98 km (61 miles), USGS said. ""It was strong,"" said Esteban Solis Mora, a telephone operator at the Real Hotel and Club Tower, near the center of San Jose. He said he felt at least three shocks over a period of about three minutes, but said he could see no damage and was aware of no injuries.","5.9 quake strikes 26 miles from the capital city of San Jose .

512,"(CNN) -- Shows at SeaWorld in San Diego, California, are expected to resume on schedule Wednesday, a day after a 12-year-old male killer whale died. The whale showed signs of being ill only on Monday, the park announced. The cause of death for Sumar won't be known until a necropsy is complete, SeaWorld said. Results may not be known for several weeks. ""It's a very sad day,"" spokesman Dave Koontz told CNN on Tuesday. ""He was a great young killer whale. He was sharp."" Sumar, who weighed about 5,000 pounds, had been at SeaWorld San Diego since 2001, coming from an Ohio park. He was one of seven killer whales at SeaWorld and was able to exhibit about 100 ""behaviors,"" Koontz said. The killer whale had no medical history or problems with behavior, the spokesman said, adding that there was no evidence of communicable disease. ""He had a great disposition."" ""Trainers had noticed that Sumar was acting lethargic yesterday [Monday] afternoon. Park veterinarians began a regimen of antibiotics to help try to stabilize his condition while they attempted to determine the cause of his illness,"" a SeaWorld statement said. ""His condition worsened today and a decision was made to cancel the 12:30 p.m. Shamu show, so that trainers and veterinarians could continue to devote their full attention to Sumar. Despite these efforts, Sumar did not survive."" Orlando, Florida-based SeaWorld was recently fined $75,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for three safety violations, including one classified as willful, after an animal trainer was killed by a whale in Orlando in February. SeaWorld, which also has a location in San Antonio, Texas, said it would contest the violations. The last killer whale to die at the San Diego venue was Splash, who was sickly when SeaWorld adopted him. He was nursed back to health and lived 15 years until 2005. No public memorial for Sumar has been planned, although fans will be able to comment on the park's Facebook page, Koontz said.","Killer whale dies at SeaWorld in San Diego .

513,"(CNN) -- On October 12, 2000, a suicide bomber attacked the USS Cole as it refueled in Aden, Yemen. A rubber boat packed with explosives detonated, killing 17 and wounding at least 37 more. Ten years later the destroyer -- also known as DDG 67 -- is in port at Norfolk, Virginia, after returning just a month ago from a mission in the Gulf of Aden, according to Command Duty Officer Lt. Torsten Becker. The ship's crew and others commemorated the 10-year anniversary Tuesday at Naval Station Norfolk. ""We lost 17 of our shipmates that terrible morning 10 years ago, but they were far more than just our sailors,"" said Adm. J.C. Harvey Jr., commander of U.S. Fleet Forces Command. ""They were your fathers, your sons and daughters, your sisters and brothers. They coached Little League. They loved to work on cars. They ran track and played football. They acted in high school plays. They loved life, they loved living and they loved you. ""They were proud to serve,"" he said. ""... We remember them here in this special place, where we can keep them close."" Harvey and current Cole crew members laid a wreath before a memorial honoring those who died, after their names, rank and hometowns were read. Guests were asked to rise and ""Taps"" was played. Harvey also spoke of the heroism of the Cole crew who worked for three days to save the ship and tend their injured crewmates following the explosion. They acted with no electrical power and no shipboard communication system to coordinate efforts, he said. ""The first 48 hours provided no opportunity for rest, and when they did find a moment to lay down, it was on a hot steel deck under a blazing sun,"" he said. ""... They were on their own, and what help there was, was far away."" ""Ask any of our Cole sailors today about their actions during the fight to save the ship and I believe they'll all tell you the same thing -- 'We were U.S. Navy sailors, and we did what we had to do. We just did our jobs.' ""No greater testament exists to the courage and tenacity of the Cole crew of October 2000 than the USS Cole today,"" he said. ""We brought Cole back, healed her wounds and made her ready to serve once again, just as we did with so many of the Cole sailors who were also so grievously wounded that day."" The Navy has made changes in the decade since the incident, he said. Recruits must now undergo a drill on the same type of boat as the Cole, where they must put out fires, battle flooding and tend to wounded people -- very like what the Cole crew did following the blast. The bomb blast 10 years ago ripped a 40-by-60-foot hole in the side of the ship, according to the U.S. Navy. Over 14 months, shipyard workers in Pascagoula, Mississippi, replaced 550 tons of steel plate and 275 miles of cable. After $250 million of repairs and updates, the Cole returned to duty in April 2002. Glass cases on board the USS Cole display three American flags to commemorate the terrorist attack, according to the U.S. Navy. The first is the flag that was flying when the attack occurred. Another draped the coffin of a fallen crew member. The third was flown upon the ship's first return to the Gulf of Aden after the attack. A plaque commemorates the victims, and the deck is inlaid with 17 stars to serve as reminders of those who died. ""I used to play a little game with myself: say all their names every time I stepped on a star,"" said Daren Jones, one of 40 sailors who were on board during the attack and served with the renovated vessel's crew of 350. ""I think it sends a message of what kind of country we have and what we're willing to do to keep our ships back at sea,"" Jones told CNN in 2002 when the ship redeployed. In December 2000, an investigation found that the USS Cole had not fully implemented its security plan the day of the attack. ""They didn't do everything they said they were going to do,"" a Pentagon official familiar with the investigation told CNN then. The Cole was operating under an alert level that warns of ""an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist activity"" but with no particular target. That threat condition calls for a standard list of anti-terrorism measures, including one that requires that ""unauthorized craft should be kept away from the ship."" The blast occurred when a small boat that appeared to be friendly pulled up alongside the Cole and exploded. In an online video, ""USS Cole 10 Years Later,"" the Navy touts improved security measures resulting from the Cole attack. ""The attack of the Cole prompted a shift in damage control training throughout the Navy,"" the narration reads. And when recruits train in ""mass casualty,"" clocks are set at 11:18, time the USS Cole was attacked. Meanwhile, the Cole's legacy can still be felt on board today, said Becker, who had just joined the Navy at the time of the attack but was not yet stationed on the Cole. ""We're just more situation-aware on the anti-terrorism portion of it,"" he said. Becker recalled his feelings when the Navy assigned him to the Cole: ""It was a surreal feeling knowing what it had gone through."" In his latest deployment aboard the ship, Becker helped rout out pirates in the Gulf of Aden, which bears the name of the port in the attack. ""Initially it was kind of unusual,"" Becker said. ""But once we got down to business, it (the attack) was not on the forefront."" Terrorism emanating from Yemen remains a major threat to the United States, according to a recent assessment by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""American analysts now consider al Qaeda's affiliate organization in Yemen a more pressing threat to U.S. national security than the central leadership as the Yemen-based outfit is increasingly agile and looking for opportunities to strike abroad,"" the report said.","NEW: Wreath laid at memorial during ceremony .

514,"Devecser, Hungary (CNN) -- The aluminum plant at the heart of the deadly toxic red sludge spill in Hungary will resume production at the end of the week, government officials said Wednesday. And the chief executive of the plant, who was arrested on Monday, has been released pending trial, his lawyer Janos Banati said. Zoltan Bakonyi, the chief executive of the MAL aluminum plant, was detained Monday, accused of public endangerment and harming the environment, authorities said. The announcement came on the same day officials said a ninth person had died from the toxic spill. The European Union said Wednesday the rescue phase of the operation has concluded. The main priority is now is cleaning up, said Laurent de Pierrefeu, an EU official on the ground at the scene of the spill. The red sludge leaked from a reservoir at the plant in Hungary and streamed through villages and into the Danube, Europe's second largest river. The plant will be guarded by police and will be monitored by the government, the country's disaster relief commissioner said at a news conference Wednesday. Workers in Hungary have been racing to build three emergency dams to stem an expected second toxic spill from the plant. Some 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge is in the plant's reservoir, whose wall shows signs of ruptures and cracks, said Gyorgi Tottos, a spokeswoman with Hungary's emergency services department. Officials say it's only a matter of time before the wall breaks and spews the sludge across the landscape, she said. The amount of sludge that remains in the reservoir is about half the amount that spilled out more than week ago, inundating three villages and leaving the landscape covered in red. Crews were also trying to remove a layer of liquid from the top of the sludge in the reservoir in order to make the mud less mobile if the wall breaks. The aluminum company said in a statement Saturday it was doing its utmost ""to avoid further damages and to reinforce the injured deposit."" The company said it has performed extensive maintenance work and renovations in the past decade and had followed safety regulations. It has also established a relief fund for victims of the spill and was attempting to help in finding accommodations for residents who were evacuated. About 800 people had to leave the village of Kolontar, downstream from the reservoir, and hundreds of soldiers were ready to rescue inhabitants of a nearby village if the wall collapses.

515,"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old woman shot early Saturday at an off-campus party near Seton Hall University in New Jersey has died, hospital and police officials said. Four others were shot and wounded at the party in East Orange, New Jersey. Police are looking for a suspect and have offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. The victim was identified by Seton Hall's interim president as Jessica Moore, a sophomore honors student from Virginia. ""We extend our most heartfelt condolences to Jessica's family and friends,"" Seton Hall Interim President Gabriel Esteban said in a statement. ""Please know that we share in your grief and that we will be praying for you in the difficult days ahead. ""As we move forward from this senseless tragedy, we will look for peace and healing through our faith, and through the love and support of friends and family."" Officials said the shootings occurred when a man who unsuccessfully tried to crash the party returned with a handgun and opened fire. Area police and college officials pledged to work around the clock to solve what East Orange Police Director Jose Cordero called a ""horrific"" crime. Three of the victims were Seton Hall students, one a New Jersey Institute of Technology student, and a New York resident, Cordero said. ""The shooter picked the wrong city to do this crime,"" said East Orange Mayor Robert L. Bowser. ""He will be apprehended."" The incident occurred in East Orange -- about a mile from the Seton Hall campus -- at 12:17 a.m. Saturday during a party at a private residence, officials said. A man described as being in his mid-20s became involved in an altercation when he entered. He left the house, rented by a graduate student, and returned moments later with the handgun. The victims, two men and three women, were taken to University Hospital. Four suffered non-life threatening wounds, said Cordero, who, like other officials, would not identify them. Hospital officials will not release their conditions, spokeswoman Stacy Newton said. It wasn't immediately clear if the shooter, who was still at large Saturday afternoon, is a student. He is described as a black man, between about 5 feet, 11 inches tall, and 6 feet, 2 inches tall, and having a stocky build and a scruffy full beard. Counseling services are being offered to Seton Hall students. A prayer service was scheduled for Saturday night. Police were looking at surveillance video in the neighborhood for potential evidence.

516,"(CNN) -- The eight people on a civilian cargo plane that crashed in the Afghan mountains near Kabul on Tuesday are presumed dead, a spokesman for Afghanistan's minister of transport said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said the crash occurred before 8 p.m. around 25 to 30 kilometers (15 to 18 miles) east of Kabul International Airport. Ros Mohammad, deputy minister of transport, said the crash took place around Mahipar Mountain east of the capital. A source from the Afghan air force said the cargo plane took off from Bagram air base and was landing at Kabul airport, which amounts to a 30- to 45-minute flight. The source wasn't authorized to speak about the matter and asked for anonymity. Preston Murray, president of Michigan-based National Air Cargo, said he could not specify the nationalities of those on board, but did not believe any to be American. The plane is owned and operated by Trans Afrique of Ghana, he said. National Air Cargo is a customer, he said. National Air Cargo received reports ""that the plane was on the radar and then it wasn't,"" Murray said. An ISAF statement said the plane was not an ISAF aircraft, and Lt. Col. John Dorrian, ISAF spokesman, said the aircraft was from Uganda. ""Early reports indicate the plane is an L-100 Hercules aircraft, the civilian equivalent of a military C-130,"" the statement said. ISAF said the airport is expected to remain open. Afghan and ISAF service members were conducting the search-and-rescue mission. The incident comes on the same day a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at a NATO helicopter after it landed in Kunar province. That strike killed an Afghan interpreter and wounded eight people -- seven NATO-led service members and an Afghan police officer. There were 26 people on the craft. Earlier this year, 44 people were killed when a plane crashed in the mountainous Kabul region. It had been en route in May from Kunduz to Kabul. The plane was carrying 38 passengers and six crew members when it crashed at 13,500 feet (4,100 meters). CNN's Ivan Watson and CNN producer Najibullah Sharifi contributed to this report.","NEW: Eight people on the plane are believed to be killed .

517,"(CNN) -- A gas explosion Saturday killed at least 20 workers at a coal mine in central China, state media reported. Xinhua news agency earlier reported that 30 miners were trapped after the explosion in Henan province. The explosion comes after China announced this week that it had closed 1,355 small coal mines this year, according to Xinhua . The effort was part of a larger plan to restructure the mining industry to  prevent deadly accidents and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Xinhua reported,  citing the National Energy Administration (NEA). China has one of the world's deadliest records for miners, with poor safety  standards accounting for thousands of deaths each year. According to the China Mining Association, the goal is to eventually boost  the industry. Small coal mines, which use outdated technology, will be replaced  with larger coal mines, increasing capacity.","Dozens more still trapped, state media says .

518,"(CNN)  -- It was Pakistan's birthday on August 14, and no one celebrated. The monsoon floods that engulfed most of the country and affected 20 million people have added yet another burden of misery onto the shoulders of the average Pakistani. More than 4 million people are homeless. Livestock, crops and livelihoods were  destroyed. How far this once-proud nation has fallen. In Urdu, Pakistan means the ""land of the pure."" It reflects the noble intentions of its creators to build a nation that enshrined the best of Islamic principles. Unfortunately, that nobility has given way to chaos because of bad luck, incompetent political leaders, corruption and religious extremism. Pakistan may be a world away from the United States, but instability feeds the extremism that fuels terrorism, so we ignore this crisis at our peril. To find the path forward, we must look back to the past. During the 1970s, my father packed up our family of five and moved us to Pakistan. He believed Pakistan had higher standards of early schooling and stronger social values than his adopted home of England. Soon after, Russian tanks rumbled into Afghanistan and then came wave after wave of Afghan refugees. By the mid '80s, the full impact of the war waging next door came home to Pakistan. The U.S. priority was to evict the Russians from Afghanistan at any cost. Pakistan followed along. As a result, educating the masses, dealing with a sea of refugees, nurturing democracy, developing infrastructure and eradicating Afghan heroin all took second place. The Pakistan my father brought us home to experience was disappearing before our eyes. This was a defining moment. Instead of focusing on its own problems, it chose instead to fight the war for the West, and 30 years later, Pakistan is still paying for this decision. After Russia withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, the Americans walked away. But Pakistan couldn't. Growing unrest and infighting in Afghanistan gave the Taliban an opportunity to step in. The only thing that mattered to the Taliban was how quickly and crudely the practitioners could inflict their horrifying version of Islam on the Afghan people. Then, all hell broke loose on September 11, 2001. Since 9/11, Pakistan has supported America's intervention in Afghanistan, the right decision but one fraught with controversy. It has torn Pakistan into factions and triggered suicide bombings. Even before the monsoon hit, the country was an economic, political and social disaster. Can Pakistan be saved? I believe it can, but the fortunes of this ailing nation can only be changed with America's help. America may not have intended to hurt Pakistan, but it's clear that Pakistan's support for U.S. policy contributed to its decline. The good news is that today there is real opportunity for change. Pakistan needs America's help. America needs a stable Pakistan. The United States was the first nation to offer aid after the flooding disaster, pledging $150 million. This is a positive first step in a much-needed long-term reconstruction plan for Pakistan. But as important as the money is, ensuring that it's spent on the right things is even more critical. The Pakistan government needs to focus on three things to stop the country's downward spiral: education, infrastructure and security. Educating Pakistan is not a matter of choice, but of utmost necessity. The literacy rate for men is 61 percent, and for women it's 32 percent. Ignorance breeds poverty and extremism. Education can help break that cycle. Funding must be in place to teach every child to read and write. Educating the country's Muslim leaders is just as important. These mullahs interpret the Quran for the people, and often they do so in an uninformed, uneducated way that distorts the true teachings of Islam. A national program to certify these religious leaders is needed to address this most pressing challenge. As for infrastructure, what little was there has been washed away. The roads are a mess, electricity goes out most days and not enough food is produced. The failure of the government to deliver on the basics has demoralized the population and dampened the spirits of its entrepreneurs. Pakistan has to fix the electrical grid and improve its agricultural sector. The United States could help by opening its doors to Pakistani exporters and embarking on programs to share knowledge and help Pakistani industrialists grow their companies. In terms of security, with Afghanistan at war on one side and the barely held truce with India on the other, Pakistan needs to secure its borders, ignore the problems of its neighbors and focus internally. This means militarizing its border on the Afghan side and closing it to all but legitimate trade traffic. The core source of strife with India is the 63-year-old dispute over Kashmir, where in the past two decades, more than 80,000 Kashmiris have been killed. If America were to assist both countries in solving this issue, it would go a long way to repairing the Pakistan-India relationship. Education, infrastructure and security: Pakistan must focus on these areas with laser-like intensity and exhibit courage and vision to raise its people out of despair. I believe in Pakistan, as my father did. And with America's support and investment, someday Pakistan may even be able to dream again of achieving its noble destiny as the ""land of the pure.""

519,"(CNN) -- Johnnie Tuitel, a professional motivational speaker who has flown nearly half a million miles, is no stranger to airline trouble. Even the most savvy of business travelers, like Tuitel, are not spared inconveniences due to delays, cancellations and mechanical failure. But Tuitel experienced something new last month. For the first time in his 20-year career, he said, he was ordered off a plane that had been cleared for takeoff for what could be called his own mechanical failure. Tuitel is wheelchair-bound because of cerebral palsy, a condition he has managed to turn into a source of inspiration for the national audiences he addresses regularly. ""My first reaction was to worry about my family's safety,"" Tuitel said about the request for him to get off the plane. ""I've got kids, my father's 78 years old and not in good health; I thought, 'They're going to tell me something I don't want to hear'"" They did, but it was of a different sort: He was told he was removed from the plane because of his physical condition. ""Their argument was if something were to happen, I can't help myself or somebody else, which is an assumption first of all. Second of all, the people that made the decision are not medical doctors,"" said Tuitel, 47, of East Grand Rapids, Michigan. ""They basically told me I was too disabled to fly and I had to fly with a companion and I had to purchase that companion's ticket,"" he told HLN's ""Prime News."" The airline, US Airways, said he was ordered off the flight for his own safety. ""He did not appear to have the ability to assist himself in evacuating in the event of an emergency,"" said Michelle Mohr, a US Airways spokeswoman. ""He appeared to have a lot of difficulty moving."" Tuitel had been on a US Airways flight from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Kansas City, Missouri, where he had a late-September speaking engagement. Tuitel said he had looked into what legal courses were available to him. The Air Carrier Access Act outlines how airlines should deal with people with disabilities, but it is unclear whether US Airways' actions violated the act's provisions. But afterwards, he told ""Prime News"" that  he would not sue. Instead, he said, he would prefer to approach the matter from a civil rights standpoint. ""It's against the law to stop me from traveling for a specific reason, and if I'm already on the plane, they violated my civil rights. It's like telling Rosa Parks you can't sit on the bus,"" Tuitel said. ""I'm not angry. I was just embarrassed because I couldn't do my job."" US Airways' official policy on disabled passengers stipulates that ""for safety-related reasons, if a passenger has a mobility impairment so severe that the person is unable to physically assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft, the airline requires that the passenger travel with a safety assistant to assist the passenger to exit the aircraft in case of an emergency evacuation,"" Mohr said. ""Safety is our number one priority and we did not feel it was safe for Mr. Tuitel to fly that day,"" she said. Tuitel said that, after he was escorted off the flight, he booked a seat on Delta Air Lines and had no problems traveling alone on that flight. The airline did not contact him until nearly three weeks later, Tuitel contends, after stories began to emerge about the incident. Its only offer at that time, he said, was to reimburse him for the flight. He declined. But Friday, as the story spread to more media outlets, Mohr said US Airways' ""customer relations team had an extremely productive discussion"" with Tuitel. ""We asked Mr. Tuitel if he might be interested in working with us as a sounding board to help us continue to work toward improving our service for our customers with disabilities,"" she said. Tuitel confirmed they had ""a very productive talk."" ""They do want to right this wrong and they do want to work with me,"" he said. ""And I am hopeful -- don't want to sound cynical but it is a big company -- I am hopeful we can come up with a solution that won't only work for the two of us but will make sure that this doesn't happen to anyone with a disability in the future."" Rich Donovan, who is on the board of trustees of United Cerebral Palsy and also has the disease, didn't see the incident as one of negligence or an intent to discriminate on the part of US Airways. He attributed Tuitel's experience to a lack of training and a lack of clarity about policies and how they're applied to disabled travelers. ""There's a general lack of understanding of disability amongst the entire travel industry, and I think that's simply because they look at it as a compliance issue, rather than a customer-service issue,"" said Donovan, who is the chief investment officer of IPS Capital. Tuitel said he wants to make sure this doesn't happen to other disabled passengers. ""I don't want a little boy with a disability not have the opportunity to go somewhere. I don't want a young girl with a disability going out for her first job interview by herself to be told she can't fly in an airplane,"" Tuitel said. Donovan said he hopes this incident will serve as a learning experience for airlines and make customer service better. ""I think some dialogue and some handwringing and some getting down into the weeds here is what needs to happen so that this stuff doesn't occur again,"" he said.

520,"(CNN) -- Cholera has killed 200 people in the west African nation of Cameroon, the government said Thursday, and aid agencies feared the outbreak could spread to neighboring regions and nations. Another 2,500 cases of cholera, a deadly water-borne disease, have been diagnosed in Cameroon since an outbreak warning in June. About 70 percent of people living in the country's far north region, bordering Nigeria and Chad, do not have access to potable water, according to a Ministry of Water and Energy official. Sanitation is also limited in the area and recent flooding has aggravated the situation. UNICEF said it has dispatched emergency medical kits containing surgical gloves, water treatment tablets, cholera medicine, oral rehydration salts and educational materials. The United Nations children's agency said the outbreak could be devastating for children, who are especially vulnerable. The disease is caused by contaminated water, and many people with cholera suffer acute watery diarrhea, which leads to severe dehydration. If left untreated, it can kill quickly, possibly within hours, according to the World Health Organization. Up to 120,000 people die each year from cholera. Journalist Moki Kindzeka contributed to this report.","Health officials fear the outbreak might spread .

521,"(CNN) -- The 28-year-old victim of an acid attack was released Sunday from a Portland, Oregon, hospital, a nursing supervisor said, nearly a week after an unknown assailant threw a cup of the caustic liquid in her face. Bethany Storro was released from Legacy Emanuel Hospital, where she had undergone surgery for her injuries after the attack last Monday, according to the supervisor, who declined to give her name. Storro credits a new pair of sunglasses -- bought just 20 minutes before the attack -- with saving her eyesight. ""God is watching over me,"" Storro, of Vancouver, Washington, told CNN affiliate KATU in Portland, Oregon, last week. ""I believe in him. That his hands are on me and I can't live the rest of my life like that -- in fear. I can't let what she did to me wreck my life."" Vancouver police say they are looking for the assailant, described as an African-American woman with an athletic build and slicked-back hair pulled into a pony tail. A composite sketch of the suspect was released last week. Storro told KATU that she had stopped at a Starbucks about 7:15 p.m. Monday, just after she had gone back to buy a pair of sunglasses that she had seen earlier. The woman walked up to her and said, ""Hey pretty girl, do you want to drink this?"" When Storro declined, the woman threw the contents of the cup in her face and ran off. Storro said she spoke about the attack because she wants people to see what the woman did to her and to help authorities find the woman before she assaults someone else. The attack bears similarities to a 2008 case in London, England. Katie Piper, a young model and television presenter, was leaving her apartment in a London suburb when she was attacked by a stranger waiting for her with a cup of sulfuric acid. The liquid burned the skin on her face, neck, chest and hands. She was also left blinded in one eye. Her assailant was asked by Piper's former boyfriend, Danny Lynch, to throw the acid on her face because she ended their short relationship. Both the assailant, Stefan Sylvestre, and Lynch are serving time in prison for the attack.

522,"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- A car bomb exploded Thursday in the Russian republic of North Ossetia, killing at least 17 people -- including an 18-month-old baby -- and wounding up to 123 others, local health officials said. The vehicle blew up near a market in the city of Vladikavkaz, the republic's leader, Taimuraz Mamsurov, told the Interfax news agency. ""Information that I possess indicates that the explosion in Vladikavkaz was organized by a suicide bomber, who drove a Volga 3102 car to near the entrance to the market,"" Mamsurov said. The injured included 10 people in critical condition and 90 in serious condition, health officials said. Investigators said the explosive device contained the equivalent of 40 kilograms of TNT. The bomb was placed inside a vehicle parked at the entrance to the central market in downtown Vladikavkaz, with a suicide bomber sitting inside the car, said the Investigative Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's Office, which qualified the attack as a ""terrorist act.""  The device detonated at 11:20 a.m. (3:20 a.m. ET). The committee also said the bomb was stuffed with various pieces of metal to increase the human damage. A natural gas canister, stored in the car's trunk, also detonated, the committee said. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry is sending special medical planes to Vladikavkaz to airlift heavily injured patients to Moscow's leading trauma clinics. Friday was declared a day of national mourning in North Ossetia, according to a local government decree. Flags on all regional buildings will fly at half-staff and all entertainment programs on local TV will be cancelled as well as concerts and theater performances. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, speaking on national TV, pledged that all organizers of the deadly bombing will be identified and punished -- or killed. ""We will do all we can to catch these monsters and animals ... who have committed a terror attack, a barbaric terror attack, against ordinary people. We will do all we can to find and punish them in accordance with the laws of our country, and we will destroy them if they offer resistance or in other circumstances,"" Medvedev said. Meanwhile, the owner of the car used in the bomb attack has been identified and arrested, a local police official told the Interfax news agency. The detainee claims that he sold it to an unknown buyer on Wednesday, the policeman said. The Russian government announced each family of those killed will receive 1 million rubles in compensation (more than $32,000). Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin also condemned the bombing, saying, ""The crimes like the one that was committed in the North Caucasus today are aimed at sowing enmity between our citizens. We have no right to allow this."" North Ossetia and the rest of the Caucasus region have been plagued with violence and political instability. The market has seen other terrorist attacks in the past. In November 2008, a suicide bomber blew up a bus at a nearby bus station, killing 12 people and wounding more than 40.  An explosion killed more than 50 people and wounded 300 in March 1999.

523,"(CNN) -- Police in California have found a plastic-wrapped body that might be tied to a bizarre saga involving several homicides in the San Francisco Bay Area. The body of Frederick Sales, 35, was found bound in plastic and hidden in a closet of a home, the Hercules Police Department said in a statement Saturday. Sales' cause of death had not been determined. On August 28, Sales' father, 73-year-old Ricardo Sales, was found bludgeoned to death with multiple puncture wounds in the same home, police said. At that time, the younger Sales was reported missing. An arrest warrant was issued for Efren Valdemoro after information came to light that he had an altercation with the elder Sales and his son the previous week, authorities said. Valdemoro was killed in a shootout with California Highway Patrol officers August 31, authorities said. He was also a person of interest in the killings of two elderly women in Vallejo, California. The women were last seen August 25, according to a statement from the Vallejo police. Police in Vallejo secured a house in which the bodies of two elderly women were found, along with a large amount of explosive materials, federal and local authorities said. Valdemoro is believed to have been associated with both women, Vallejo police have said. After he was killed in a shootout with California Highway Patrol officers, officials said they found the body of Cindy Tran, Valdemoro's girlfriend, in the trunk of Valdemoro's vehicle.","Police say the body of Frederick Sales was found hidden and bound in plastic .

524,"Dallas, Texas (CNN) -- At least four tornadoes spawned by Tropical Depression Hermine touched down in and around Dallas, Texas, on Wednesday evening, knocking down walls and smashing vehicles. Sirens went off in downtown Dallas as one funnel cloud was spotted in Cockrell Hill southwest of downtown, according to CNN affiliate WFAA. One tornado was reported in Ellis County and three in Dallas County, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward.

There was one serious injury, Jason Evans of the fire department said. A truck driver's rig was picked up by the tornado, spun around and slammed into a warehouse. The driver was sitting in the cab of the truck when the front of the building collapsed on the truck. Further information on the driver and his injuries was not immediately available. CNN's Ed Lavandera: Eyewitness to a torndado . Operations at Dallas' Love Field airport were shut down temporarily as a tornado approached the field, according to Lynn Lunsford of the Federal Aviation Administration. Tower personnel were preparing to evacuate when the tornado turned away at the last minute, Lunsford said. ""Tornadoes are a common phenomenon on the eastern side of landfalling tropical systems due to increased turning of the winds with height or vertical wind shear,"" Ward said. Rescue workers across central and north Texas, meanwhile, plucked people stranded by fast-rising floodwater dumped by Hermine as it slogged northward. At least one motorist in Austin was missing. Texas Gov. Rick Perry directed the activation of state search-and-rescue capabilities, bringing in swift-water rescue teams, UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and other resources. ""I urge all Texans to realize the dangers of crossing flooded roadways and respect the barricades put in place by officials to protect Texans' lives,"" Perry said in a written statement.

Cedar Park had received 12.9 inches; Anderson Mill, 12.7 inches; Killeen, 11.6 inches; and Austin, 11.4 inches. Fort Worth had recorded 6.8 inches of rain, San Antonio, 6.7 inches and Houston, 4.4 inches. Aerial images showed scores of flooded streets and some rescues in Dallas. Portions of Austin had endured 15 inches of rain, and a middle-age motorist was missing after her car was washed away, Emergency Management spokeswoman Reyne Telles said. The car was found. Thirty-two roads were closed, and an engineer from the watershed department said this could be a 250-year event, Telles told CNN. ""I haven't seen anything like this happen here before,"" said an employee at a County Line BBQ location near Bull Creek. ""One of the boat docks washed away, and there are boats and cars stranded in the river."" The restaurant was closed Wednesday but may reopen Thursday. The employee asked not to be identified. As of 5 p.m. ET, Hermine was about 135 miles (215 kilometers) southwest of Oklahoma City. It had maximum sustained winds of 25 mph (40 kph) and was moving at 12 mph (19 kph). By late afternoon, radar showed the rain was centered on eastern Oklahoma, with a line extending down to the Mexican border in eastern Texas. ""Additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 Inches with localized higher amounts can be expected through Thursday from eastern Texas and Oklahoma into Missouri and Arkansas,"" the National Hurricane Center said. Flash flood or flood warnings were in effect for much of those states. Meanwhile, newly formed Tropical Storm Igor was bringing ""squally"" weather to the Cape Verde Islands on Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. Track Tropical Storm Igor .

It had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph) and was moving west at 6 mph (9 kph). The storm is expected to slowly strengthen over the next 48 hours, with a slight turn to the west-northwest and an increase in forward speed. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the southern Cape Verde Islands, including Maio, Sao Tiago, Fogo and Brava. Tropical storm conditions were possible in those locations in 12 to 24 hours, forecasters said. Tropical storm-force winds extended about 50 miles from Igor's center.

Mengeshe Kebede, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' representative to Pakistan, said there is a ""humanitarian tragedy"" taking place in Balochistan, with imminent threats of water-borne diseases and food shortages. ""We need to scale up our activities in the province, or else I think we are heading for a major humanitarian disaster there,"" Kebede said. ""I have worked in humanitarian situations globally, and worked in refugee camps in Africa during emergencies, but to be honest I had never seen a situation as devastating as I saw in Balochistan,"" he said.","Obama approves urgent emergency funds for Pakistan's flood victims .

526,"(CNN) -- Lab tests found hundreds of cases of salmonella contamination at an Iowa farm in a nearly two-year period before the outbreak that prompted a massive recall of eggs this summer, congressional investigators said Tuesday. Wright County Egg is one of two farms at the center of the massive recall. In a letter to its owner, Austin ""Jack"" DeCoster, leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee said tests confirmed 426 cases of salmonella contamination between September 2008 and the past July, and 73 were ""potentially"" positive for the strain of the disease involved in this year's outbreak. The committee's Democratic leaders asked DeCoster to explain those findings when he appears at a September 21 hearing. They also called on him to explain why those test reports weren't included in material the company has provided to Congress so far, and demanded that the company produce ""all documents relating to your response to the test results"" by Wednesday. ""Despite the committee's specific request, your response on September 11, 2010, did not include the 73 potentially positive results for Salmonella enteritidis,"" Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman and investigations subcommittee chairman Bart Stupak wrote. ""It also did not show whether Wright County Egg took appropriate steps to protect the public after receiving the positive test results."" Wright County Egg and another Iowa producer, Hillandale Farms, were forced to recall about 550 million eggs in August after health officials linked them to the salmonella outbreak, which has so far been blamed for more than 1,500 illnesses across the United States. Wright County Egg and other operations owned by the DeCoster family have come under increased scrutiny since the outbreak. In a written statement responding to the letter, the company said it previously pledged to ""fully respond"" to the committee's requests for documents. ""At that time, we also indicated that our response was ongoing,"" it said. The company said it was ""terribly disappointed"" to find positive tests for salmonella in its eggs, but said it provided results of those voluntary tests ""as soon as those results were available."" ""We believe our open communication about our forthright efforts to compile testing data and provide documents as requested is consistent with our ongoing cooperation with this investigation,"" it said. ""We have provided the committee with additional testing documentation today and will continue to do so as we restore past testing records."" Salmonella occurs naturally in chickens, but Food and Drug Administration inspectors reported in August that neither Wright County nor Hillandale fully followed their plans to prevent Salmonella enteritidis. Federal investigators reported finding salmonella bacteria in chicken feed and in barn and walkway areas at the farms, as well as rodents, piles of manure, uncaged birds and flies too numerous to count, the FDA said.","Congressmen demand answers from Iowa farm's owner .

527,"(CNN) -- Viva Chile. Late last winter, Chile was shaken first by a 8.8-magnitude earthquake and, later, looting and military police hitting the streets. In August, the San Jose mine collapsed, threatening the lives of 33 men trapped a half-mile underground and further testing the upstart South American country's psyche weeks ahead of its bicentennial commemoration. But this week, Chile came alive -- in the eyes of its citizens, as well as the world. Copiapo, which could have been the site of mass mourning had the miners' rescue effort gone awry, instead became home to a patriotic festival. The strong national pride was omnipresent: from the red, white and blue Chilean flags that permeated the rescue site to the chants that rang out as the miners rose to the surface. It was clear, too, many miles away -- whether it was the hugs and tears of joy among the throngs watching the scene on a flickering big-screen TV set up in a Santiago city square, the champagne corks popping at the Chilean embassy in Washington, or countless bite-sized conversations in the vast reaches of cyberspace where the Chilean miners were a top trending discussion on Twitter. ""What emotion! What happiness! What pride to be Chilean!"" wrote Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, on his own Twitter page. Like many emerging countries, Chile has not been without its challenges. It continues to emerge from the shadows of dictator Augusto Pinochet's rule from 1974 to 1990, when up to 30,000 people vanished or were killed because of their political beliefs. Economic disparities and political divisions still exist, with the global recession having a real impact in this Andean nation. Yet, its past and recent challenges notwithstanding, Chile has also emerged as a model in Latin America and the world, given its solid economic base and fervent democracy. ""Chile is ... a country with really strong institutions,"" said Peter DeShazo, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""And it's economy has done really well."" While it could have been a calamity, the San Jose mine rescue effort instead turned into a celebration, not just of the miners' survival but also the nation's collective ability (with help from international friends) to safely extricate them. Thus, this week's rescue effort gave Chileans a good reason and made-for-TV stage to show off their longstanding patriot fervor to the world. ""Chileans, in general, have a strong sense of national identity,"" said Susan Purcell, director of the University of Miami's Center for Hemispheric Policy. ""And with this episode, it's like they did everything right."" Since Pinochet, Chile has experienced significant economic growth and steady inroads combating corruption and poverty.  But until now, Chile rarely had been front-and-center in most everyday discussions of Latin America, which are more likely to be dominated by Brazil's booming development, communist Cuba, Colombia's civil war and Venezuela under leftist leader Hugo Chavez. Thus, while international policymakers and business leaders have seen (and, in some cases, been party to) its development, the mine collapse and rescue effort were many people's first sustained exposure to Chile, its people and its potential. ""Chile should be held up as a model, but it often isn't,"" said Purcell. ""I don't know if (the rescue) changes the image of Chile, or it creates an image of Chile."" Led by President Pinera, the rescue effort and Chile were very much intertwined. Government officials frequently appeared before TV cameras, Chilean flags abounded and patriotic chants rang out regularly. The loudest and emotional could be heard when the miners emerged: ""Chi! Chi! Chi! Le! Le! Le! Los mineros de Chile!"" That was no accident, said Nara Milanich, a professor at New York's Barnard College specializing in Chile. Pinera, who had seen his popularity drop since taking office last March, took control of the situation and played to the cameras, she said. Camp Hope sprung up, as a temporary home to miners' families as well as the scores of global media who descended on the scene. ""They are so conscious that the world is watching,"" said Milanich. ""This is as genuinely Chilean as Baywatch is genuinely American. This is a TV show."" Still, for all the production set-ups and political posturing, Milanich said that Chileans' joy was true and widely felt. While the release came at a critical time for Chileans, who wrestled with ""soul-searching"" after the quake and during the bicentennial commemoration, it reflected citizens' deep-rooted sense that Chile is worth celebrating. And in Latin America -- especially given Chile's rivalry with Andean neighbors Bolivia and Peru dating back to the 19th century War of the Pacific -- such self-congratulation among Chileans is almost expected and sometimes resented. ""I don't think Chileans suffer from an inferiority complex,"" said Kristen Sorensen, a professor at Bentley University in Massachusetts. ""In some sense, they have a superiority complex.""","Experts say that Chileans have long boasted a strong sense of national identity .

528,"(CNN) -- A personal phone conversation by an air traffic controller likely contributed to the cause of a deadly midair collision over the Hudson River last year, the The National Transportation Safety Board said. A single-engine plane and a sightseeing helicopter collided on August 8, 2009 near Hoboken, New Jersey. All nine people aboard the two aircraft were killed, including several Italian tourists visiting New York from Bologna. In a statement released Tuesday, the NTSB said the air traffic controller's personal phone call ""distracted him from his air traffic control duties, including the timely transfer of communications for the accident airplane to the Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) tower and correcting the airplane pilot's incorrect read-back of the EWR tower frequency."" The on-duty personal phone conversation might not have been the first for the air traffic controller. An NTSB report says the controller's personal call might not have taken place ""if the front line manager had corrected the controller's performance deficiency involving an earlier nonpertinent telephone conversation."" In addition, the board said, the ""front line manager, who was not present in the air traffic control tower at the time of the accident, exercised poor judgment by not letting staff know how he could be reached while he was away from the tower and by not using an available staffing asset to provide an additional layer of oversight at the tower during his absence."" The NTSB said another probable cause was the limitations of the ""see-and-avoid"" concept. ""The see-and-avoid technique of averting mid-air collisions was not effective because of the difficulty the airplane pilot had in seeing the helicopter until the final seconds before the collision,"" the NTSB said. The safety board said contributing factors included both pilots ineffective use of their aircrafts' electronic advisory system to maintain awareness of other air traffic; inadequate procedures of the Federal Aviation Administration for transferring communication among air traffic facilities near the Hudson River; and FAA regulations that did not provide for adequate vertical separation of aircraft operating over the Hudson River. ""The helicopter's climb above 1,000 feet was not consistent with company procedures and decreased the vertical separation between the aircraft,"" the statement said. NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman said the collision could have been prevented. ""While traffic alerts go a long way in helping pilots ""see and avoid"" other aircraft, these technologies are not, in and of themselves, enough to keep us safe,"" Hersman said in the statement. ""Strong operating procedures, professionalism, and commitment to the task at hand -- these are all essential to safety."" The NTSB said it made recommendations to the FAA about changes in a ""special flight rules area"" surrounding the Hudson River corridor near New Jersey and New York. Suggestions include revising federal regulations to specify altitudes for aircraft conducting local operations.","9 people died from a two-aircraft collision over the Hudson River last year .

529,"(CNN) -- As the relief effort in flood-hit Pakistan intensified Monday, officials were bracing themselves for an outbreak of disease among the millions affected by the country's worst deluge in 80 years. Rushing floodwaters and mudslides triggered by monsoon rains have engulfed large swathes of northwestern Pakistan since Thursday, killing an estimated 1,500 people said Information Minister Mian Ifthikar Hussain on Monday. Now government officials are concerned a lack of drinking water is spreading conditions such as cholera and gastroenteritis in affected areas such as the Swat Valley in Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa Province, Agence France-Presse reported. ""We estimate that about 100,000 people, mostly children, have been hit by cholera and gastro diseases,"" Syed Zahir Ali Shah, health minister for Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, was quoted by AFP as saying. iReport: Are you there? Send pictures, video . ""Our priority is to first evacuate them to safe areas and then provide them with medical treatment,"" he added. But the rescue and recovery efforts could become more complicated as monsoon rains continued to fall across much of Pakistan Monday. ""Anything they get will aggravate an already devastating situation,"" said Brandon Miller, a meteorologist with CNN International. The Pakistan Meteorological Department said Monday that it expects enhanced monsoon activity for the first two weeks of August. It forecast widespread rain in the next four days in Sindh, Punjab, Kashmir, Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, northeast Balochistan and Islamabad. Areas along the Indus River will be badly affected due to extremely high flood conditions, the department has said. Special: Impact Your World . Tens of thousands of people remain trapped on rooftops and in higher areas trying to escape rising floodwaters, according to the United Nations. ""We've got the government sending boats and helicopters to try to reach people and bring them to safety at the same time as trying to deliver emergency relief,"" said Nicki Bennett, a senior humanitarian affairs officer for the U.N. Damaged roads and bridges have made rescuing stranded residents difficult, she said, noting that even a U.N. warehouse where the organization stores food, blankets, soaps and bucks is partially underwater. The Pakistani military, which has deployed dozens of helicopters and boats across the region, said 25 bridges have been destroyed and some 36 miles (58 kilometers) of road washed away in Swat and Shangla districts. Despite these difficulties, senior commanders in the region told reporters that tens of thousands of people had been rescued from Shangla, Peshawar, Nowshera and Charsadda. In the hardest-hit province, Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, authorities estimate that 800 people have died and more than 100 are still missing, the World Health Organization said. ""The actual figures could be higher as communication networks in many areas are still disrupted,"" it said in a report. About 15,000 families in the province need emergency assistance, such as food, clean water, shelter and medical services, the organization said. ""As the water level recedes, measures to prevent water-borne diseases will also become a priority,"" it said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon late Sunday authorized $10 million in emergency aid. This follows an earlier pledge by the United States to send helicopters, boats, pre-fabricated bridges and water-filtration units. The European Union and China have also committed to provide humanitarian aid. A Pakistani Red Crescent official told CNN that the number of people affected by the floods has risen to nearly 2.5 million people, with infrastructure receiving major damage. Rushing water also has washed away thousands of acres of crops, government buildings, businesses, schools, bridges and homes, officials said. CNN's Reza Sayah, Nazneen Akbari and Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.","NEW: Up to 1,500 people killed in floods said Information Minister Mian Ifthikar Hussain .

530,"(CNN) -- Six counties in eastern North Carolina have been declared federal disaster areas after heavy rains from Tropical Storm Nicole earlier this month caused extensive flooding and subsequent damage. Gov. Bev Perdue's office said it received notice Thursday afternoon that the federal agency had issued the declaration, which makes business and homeowners affected by the floods in Beaufort, Bertie, Craven, Hertford, Onslow and Tyrrell counties eligible for low-interest loans and grants. ""In a time when the economy is down and our people are struggling, it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel after losses like these,"" Perdue, a Democrat, said in a press release. ""Now families can take some hope from the fact that they will have help replacing some of those losses."" Eight people died in early October after Tropical Storm Nicole interacted with another low-pressure weather front to dump heavy rain from the Carolinas north to Cape Cod. North Carolina was especially hard hit. In Bertie County, for instance, waters that reached as high as stop signs caused the full or partial closure of scores of roads. And many businesses and several historic homes in the town of Windsor ended up partially submerged. County, state and federal emergency officials last week surveyed the storm's impact in 21 North Carolina counties, according to Perdue's office. They found damage to 420 homes -- including 60 that were destroyed -- and 80 businesses. Homeowners who qualify for federal assistance in the six affected counties can receive up to $240,000 to repair or replace their homes and personal belongings. Emergency management officials said that, based on preliminary estimates, they do not believe the state of North Carolina will qualify for federal funding to recoup costs for emergency measures or pay for repairs to roads, bridges or other infrastructure, according to the governor's office.","FEMA has declared federal disaster areas in six North Carolina counties .

531,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An anti-insurgent provincial governor who had survived Taliban assassination attempts was among 20 people who died Friday in an explosion at a northern Afghan mosque during prayers, a government official said. The blast in Afghanistan's Takhar province killed Kunduz provincial governor Mohammad Omar, who recently sounded an alarm about the threat of insurgents during an interview with CNN. The bombing also wounded 35 others, with most of those killed and injured engaged in prayer, said Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Zamarai Bashari. ""It is a terrible incident,"" said Bashari, who said police were trying to find out more details about the strike and who is responsible. The NATO-led command condemned the attack, saying that ""it's unconscionable that anyone would attack a mosque."" ""It's clear the insurgents have no respect for the most holy of Islamic places,"" said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Greg Smith, spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul deplored the act, saying ""whoever was responsible"" for striking a house of worship ""has demonstrated a clear lack of disregard for the Afghan people and for the peaceful religion they practice."" The mosque was bloodied and its roof was shattered, eyewitness Mujib Rahman said, but there were different early accounts on how the strike was carried out. Gen. Daoud Daoud, commander of the Afghan Interior Ministry's northern zone, said a suicide attacker apparently sitting next to the governor detonated a bomb. Faiz Mohammad Powhidi, a Takhar governor spokesman, told CNN that a pre-placed mine exploded. He explained that governor had been visiting his family and attending Friday prayers weekly in his native province of Takhar, which borders Kunduz. Omar, who was a Pashtun, had survived several assassination attempts by the Taliban, and his brother was slain a few months ago. He told CNN on Sunday that for the last two years, the security situation has deteriorated in Kunduz because insurgents decided to destabilize northern Afghanistan, which, until recently, had been relatively stable during the nine-year-old Afghan conflict. The Takhar blast and the Thursday killing of a German soldier in the north illustrates a growing unrest that contrasts with the first years after the Taliban's collapse in 2001. In those days, the north was much more secure than the predominantly ethnic Pashtun south and east of the country. Omar told CNN that the insurgents were trying to use Kunduz as a launchpad to destabilize northern Afghanistan and the wider Central Asian region and lamented the lack of police available to battle insurgents. ""Currently 40 percent of Kunduz province is under Taliban control,"" he said. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle conveyed his regrets to the Afghan government in a letter. ""Yesterday we suffered the death of a Bundeswehr soldier,"" he said. ""Today the news reaches us of another attack in which the governor of Kunduz, Mohammad Omar, was killed. I wanted to express my condolences on the part of the federal government."" Other violence rippled across the country on Friday. Three coalition soldiers in southern Afghanistan were killed: one in an insurgent attack and two others in improvised explosive device attacks. NATO does not give the nationalities of service members who are killed, but the British Defence Ministry said one of its soldiers was killed in Helmand province in the south Friday. NATO-led forces killed five armed men in eastern Afghanistan's Khost province. The command is investigating allegations of civilian casualties in the latter incident, ISAF said.","NEW: NATO, U.S. Germans condemn attack .

532,"(CNN) -- Four Americans were killed in a small plane crash in northwestern Mexico, the president of the volunteer organization Flying Samaritans said Saturday. The plane had been headed on a medical mission in the Mexican state of Baja California and lost radio contact with the ground on Friday afternoon, said Flying Samaritans President Victor Jones. The wreckage of a Beechcraft A36 plane and the bodies of the four volunteers were discovered Saturday ""after an extensive ground, air and water search,"" Jones said in a statement Saturday. The wreckage was located in rough terrain about 30 miles south of Ensenada, Mexico -- a city on the Pacific coast -- where the plane had departed Friday afternoon en route to San Quintin, Mexico. Jones said that Mexican authorities found four bodies in the wreckage. Radio contact with the plane was lost shortly after the pilot reported to the Ensenada airport on Friday when it was about 10 miles south of the airport, Jones said. He identified the victims as: James Thornton, a plastic surgeon; Graciela Sarmiento, a doctor; Andrew Theil, a non-medical support staffer; and Roger Lyon, the pilot. Flying Samaritans transports medical and support personnel to clinics in Baja California -- which is just south of California, the American state -- where they provide free medical services and supplies to those who lack medical care.

533,"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN)  -- More than 50,000 residents of northern Colombia remained homeless Monday after the rain-swollen Magdalena River broke through dikes and flooded towns and surrounding areas. Floods hit Valle de Cauca, Colombia, last month. Floods are blamed for 67 deaths in Colombia since September. In the town of Plato, the water flooded 4,000 homes and buildings, leaving 40,000 people homeless, Mayor Jose Rosales Cortina told El Tiempo newspaper. The floodwaters washed away 50 houses, he said. No fatalities have been reported in this weekend's flooding. ""Everything is collapsing -- the economic system, the health system, public services,"" Rosales Cortina said in an interview on CNN affiliate Caracol TV. ""We need help,"" one anguished woman said on the newscast. ""Don't you see that the town is totally flooded? We don't have anything in this town. No one helps us here."" The flooding has hit several other riverside cities in Magdalena, one of Colombia's 32 state-like ""departments."" Municipalities in other departments also have been flooded. In Plato, about 560 miles north of Bogota, the Magdalena River broke through a levee Saturday. The suddenness of the flooding surprised many residents. Water reached the rooftops of many homes and power was lost in most of the city. ""The water roared. It roared,"" said resident Noris Padilla. ""The current took you away. You couldn't hold onto anything. It took away eight houses here."" Alvaro Padilla said on Caracol TV that he went underwater to look inside his house, which had water nearly to the roof. ""The furniture, the bed, the television, everything is under water,"" he said. Thousands of homeless residents have taken shelter in hospitals, schools and sports venues. Police in Plato, which has 70,000 residents, have restricted access to the city because of looting. Caracol showed a resident carrying a rifle overhead as he waded through chest-high water. ""First of all, they steal our electric wiring. They take our roofs. They take all that away. So we have to stay here,"" the man said, pointing to his weapon. At a nearby school, La Escuela Urbana Mixta San Rafael, a man was treading water near the building's front wall as he spoke with a reporter on a boat. ""The computers, the fans, all that is underwater,"" he said. Magdalena Gov. Omar Diaz Granados said officials have delivered 2,500 food baskets, 1,000 hammocks, 1,000 awnings, 5,000 sleeping bags and 10 rolls of plastic to make shelters. Plato Mayor Rosales said eight of the city's 11 districts were flooded, including several government buildings, the courthouse, a clinic and the city's main Catholic church. The priest had taken refuge on the second floor of the parish house. Even though some food has been delivered, Rosales said, some people are hungry. ""There is still no official tally, but the losses are in the multimillions,"" Rosales told El Tiempo, ""There are stores, houses and farms destroyed. In sum, people who lost it all."" In the town of Pedraza in Heredia department, 4,000 people fled to higher ground after the Magdalena ripped a 150-foot hole in a retention wall. Water reached the rooftops of more than 330 homes and flooded the town's school and church, El Tiempo said. At least 2,500 residents lost everything. In Bolivar department, 1,500 families were flooded out in the town of Regidor. Nationwide, the Colombian Civil Defense said, nearly 1 million people have been left homeless since Colombia's rainy season started in mid-September. The rainy season has lasted longer than usual. Officials say flooding has killed 67 people and injured 94 this year, Caracol Radio reported. Eighteen people remain missing in 27 departments.","Floodwaters from Magdalena River reach rooftops in northern Colombia .

534,"(CNN) -- From the start of the tragedy, aid agencies warned that not enough help was flowing into flood-devastated Pakistan. Now, seven long weeks into the steamrolling crisis, the United Nations and private charitable organizations are sounding the alarm again as large chunks of the country remain submerged and about 20 million people are in need of assistance. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced Friday that the United Nations is seeking another $1.594 billion for flood victims, bringing the total to more than $2 billion. The world body has already received about 70 percent of $460 million it initially requested. ""In the floods' wake, we are seeing hunger, misery and desperation,"" Ban said. ""Children becoming malnourished. Skin diseases on the rise because of the lack of soap and clean water. Nowhere for families to shelter from the sweltering sun. ""Diarrhea could spread quickly in these conditions. Clean water and sanitation equipment must reach even more people. Millions of children and pregnant women are especially at risk. They need access to critical health care. Pakistan is not facing just one humanitarian crisis -- but many at once. Different responses are required."" He called the Pakistan floods ""the worst natural disaster the United Nations has responded to in its 65-year history."" The global spotlight may have shifted away, but floodwaters are still raging through the heart of Pakistan, creating new crises every day, said Valerie Amos, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs. ""An immense tragedy continues to unfold,"" Amos said. ""The human implications of what will happen if not enough is done are terrible. Many millions have already lost everything and have nothing to go back to. ... What I will be doing is asking our supporters to dig deeper and to do more."" But even the new appeal may not be enough as the U.N. food agency said Friday that it needs $600 million for emergency food supplies until next July. So far, it has only received $103 million. The World Food Programme is aiming to feed 6 million people every month while transitioning to recovery activities such as food-for-work programs that will help rehabilitate damaged agricultural lands and infrastructure and restore livelihoods, the agency said. It estimates that at least 17 million acres of farmland from north to south are under water and hundreds of bridges and roadways have been destroyed. On top of that, markets have been disrupted and food prices have skyrocketed, leaving many Pakistanis unable to feed themselves or their families, the WFP said. ""No one could have predicted the scale and enormity of this catastrophe where women and children are facing a dangerous downwards spiral of hunger and malnutrition,"" WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said in a written statement. ""We need to scale-up now and we need to scale-up quickly."" The scale of the devastation was visible from a helicopter this week. From the sky, the landscape below was brown with wide rivers of murky water while specks of bright blue tarpaulins and tents dotted dry land. ""The road to recovery will be long and arduous and Pakistan will need all the help it can get to build back from this disaster,"" Sheeran said. Hunger is just one of Pakistan's myriad problems. Public health experts remain concerned about disease outbreaks. As of a week ago, the United Nations reported more than 700,000 cases of acute diarrhea, at least 800,000 acute respiratory infections, nearly a million cases of skin disease and almost 183,000 suspected malaria cases. ""All of the elements conducive for this to happen are present -- poor sanitation and water supplies, and people are living in cramped conditions in open camp settings,"" said Sylvain Groulx, a project coordinator with Medecins Sans Frontieres, sometimes referred to as Doctors Without Borders, in northern Sindh province. ""Health authorities here have confirmed that there is usually an increase in the number of people who seek medical assistance following Eid, and we are expecting that the health system will be overburdened in the coming days,"" Groulx said in a news release.

535,"(CNN) -- Germany captain Michael Ballack has suffered a fractured left knee cap following a heavy challenge while playing for Bayer Leverkusen against Hanover on Saturday. The 33-year-old former Chelsea and Bayern Munich midfielder limped off after 30 minutes of the Bundesliga clash and is expected to be out of action for up to two months. The injury means Ballack has already been ruled out of the Euro 2012 qualifiers against Turkey and Kazakhstan. It is a further blow to Ballack, who missed the World Cup finals with an ankle injury and was subsequently left out of the Germany squad for this month's ties against Belgium and Azerbaijan. Germany national coach Joachim Loew released a statement saying: ""I feel sorry for Michael that he must accept a new health setback. Of course I wish him a quick and speedy recovery."" Meanwhile, Mainz joined Hoffenheim at the top of the Bundesliga table with a 2-1 home victory over Kaiserslautern on Sunday. The visitors went into the interval with the lead courtesy of a well-taken goal from Croatian striker Srdjan Lakic. But Niko Bungert levelled after 71 minutes and Mainz collected all three points with a deflected strike from teenager Andre Schuerrle. The result means Mainz have won all their three opening matches and they stand on nine points, trailing Hoffenheim at the top only on goal difference.","Germany captain Michael Ballack has suffered a fractured left knee cap .

536,"CNN -- The Williams team has called on Formula One bosses to review the safety-car rules after Sunday's controversial European Grand Prix in Spain. Nine drivers were given post-race penalties for speeding while the safety car was on duty following a horrific crash involving Red Bull's Mark Webber, who was lucky to escape the incident unhurt. After seeing Williams driver Rubens Barrichello incur a five-second penalty after finishing fourth in Valencia, the team's technical director Sam Michael said the sport needs to reassess the rules. ""In this regard the [safety car] regulations probably need a review, rather than clarifying,"" he told Formula One's official website. ""From a personal perspective, I was in favor of the old system when you could duck and dive into the pits under the safety car in order to win advantage, but I also appreciate that the current rules are there to promote safety."" Ferrari President Luca di Montezemolo told the team's official website that he hopes motorsport's ruling body, the FIA, takes ""necessary decisions"" in a race he described as ""unacceptable."" Lewis Hamilton of McLaren was also penalized in Spain for illegally overtaking the safety car to retain second position before pitting. Championship leader Hamilton was later able to take a delayed drive-through penalty without losing his second place, allowing him to earn 18 valuable points. Vettel cruises to victory in Valencia . Fernando Alonso, who finished eighth in Valencia, said the controversial incident involving Hamilton gave Ferrari a disadvantage over one of his team's closest rivals. ""It was unfair -- we respected the rules and didn't overtake under the yellow flag,"" Alonso told reporters. ""They gave the penalty but a bit too late -- 20 laps to investigate one piece of overtaking."" This is not the first controversial incident this season regarding the safety-car rules. Confusion surrounded the Canadian Grand Prix after Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher passed Alonso during the end of lap 78 while the safety car was still on the track. Latest F1 championship standings . Despite the seven-time world champion pleading his innocence, the FIA stewards deemed the move illegal, handing him a post-race 20-second drive-through penalty which saw the German fall from sixth place to 12th. Last week the FIA attempted to clarify the incident by saying that no driver is allowed to overtake the safety car when it is deployed at the beginning of, or during, the final lap. However, the incidents at the European Grand Prix have now cast further doubt on the way the sport is governed. Montezemolo said the race was in danger of damaging the sport's credibility. ""Ferrari, which showed itself to be competitive in the European Grand Prix, paid a price that was too high for respecting the rules,"" he told Ferrari's official website. ""Meanwhile, those who didn't follow the rules were penalized by the race officials in a way that was less severe than the damage suffered by those who did respect them."" ""That is a very serious and unacceptable event that creates dangerous precedents, throwing a shadow over the credibility of Formula One.""","Williams' Sam Michael calls for the FIA to reassess the current safety-car rules .

537,"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- What was Hurricane Karl was losing its punch in Mexico Friday, while Category 2 Hurricane Igor turned toward Bermuda, which is bracing for landfall late Sunday. A third hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean, Julia, continued to sputter, forecasters said. Karl's eye came ashore just north of the city of Veracruz, Mexico, around 11:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET) Friday. Karl was gradually downgraded to a tropical storm, with 70 mph (115 kph) winds at 8 p.m. ET, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm's biggest threat may come from torrential rainfall. Some areas may receive between 5 to 10 inches, with isolated amounts of 15 inches possible. At least 3,000 homes in central Mexico were damaged when Karl came ashore, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. The Hurricane Center said the storm is expected to weaken to a tropical depression soon and dissipate over the mountains of Mexico on Sunday. Some local flooding was reported, the Mexican Interior Ministry said. The Mexican government canceled all coastal warnings and watches. Meanwhile, the two other hurricanes in the tropical trio churned in the open Atlantic Ocean. A storm system south of the Cape Verde Islands has a 10 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone, forecasters said. At 8 p.m. (7 p.m. ET), Hurricane Igor, downgraded to Category 2, had maximum sustained winds near 105 mph (165 kph). It was moving toward the northwest at 10 mph (17 kph), but forecasters said its forward speed and strength are expected to increase in the next couple of days, followed by gradual weakening. Igor was about 600 miles (965 kilometers) south-southeast of Bermuda. A hurricane warning was in effect for the island, which was already feeling effects from the storm, the Hurricane Center said. The United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office called Igor a ""dangerous"" storm and said Bermudan authorities are making appropriate plans for its arrival late Sunday or early Monday. British nationals are getting updated travel advice. Home Affairs Minister David Burch warned island residents to be ready for storm surge and high winds. ""It is my sincere hope that you and your families take the remainder of today to finalize your hurricane preparations, by securing your homes, your property and ensuring that you have adequate supplies,"" he said. Officials expect to close the main airport Saturday. A British frigate will be stationed offshore, ready to offer any assistance. Large swells generated by Igor will continue to affect the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas and the Virgin Islands, according to the weather agency. These swells are expected to cause dangerous surf- and rip-current conditions in Bermuda over the next several days. The swells will reach the eastern coast of the United States, including Florida, on Friday and continue through the weekend, possibly causing rip currents. In the far eastern Atlantic, Category 1 Hurricane Julia continued to weaken. As of 5 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), Julia's maximum sustained winds were 75 mph (120 kph). The storm was moving west-northwest at about 18 mph (30 kph).

538,"(CNN) -- Police in a Chicago, Illinois, suburb Wednesday were investigating a pipe-bomb explosion that decapitated a man. The body of Colin Dalebroux, 21, was found near a middle school close to his apartment in Evanston, Illinois, on Tuesday, CNN affiliates reported, citing local police. WGN-TV reported that a man walking his dog in a park found the body when his pet tugged at his leash. The man, Dale Wyatt, and another pedestrian saw the body and called police. ""Honestly, at first I thought it was a mannequin, like somebody was playing a sick prank,"" Wyatt said. Wyatt said the body ""was laying, his legs were underneath his body like he was laying down. His right arm was up and then everything from the neck up was completely gone."" Police on Tuesday said an explosion was heard in the area about 3:53 a.m. and residents thought it was a blown transmitter. Police responded but couldn't identify the source of the sound. Nearly two hours later, police were called again when the man's body was discovered. Police arriving on the scene saw what they thought was an ""operable explosive device"" and called the Cook County Bomb Squad. Officers immediately established a safety perimeter and went door-to-door to notify residents. The device was safely rendered inoperable, authorities said. Police believe the victim had two explosive devices, thought to be pipe bombs: the one that was dismantled and ""one of which detonated ending his own life."" Police searched the area and went to what was thought to be the victim's residence. ""While at this location, Evanston Police determined that no immediate public safety risk existed,"" police said Tuesday. Investigators were working with the FBI to examine the man's computer. The school, Nichols Middle School, is closed for the second day in a row because of the blast and the probe into the incident.","The incident occurred in Evanston .

539,"(CNN) -- Toyota has reached a settlement with two families over product liability claims following a crash that killed four family members, a spokesman for the automaker said. California Highway Patrolman Mark Saylor; his wife, Cleofe Lastrella; a 13-year-old daughter, Mahala; and Saylor's brother-in-law, Chris Lastrella, were killed when a Lexus sedan they were in accelerated uncontrollably on a freeway near San Diego last year and crashed over an embankment. Lexus is a division of Toyota. ""Toyota and the Saylor and Lastrella families reached an amicable agreement in mediation that fully resolves their product liability claims against Toyota and a Lexus dealership,"" Brian R. Lyons said. ""Through mutual respect and cooperation, we were able to resolve this matter without the need for litigation."" Lyons said the company and two families ""wish to keep the amount of the settlement confidential."" Saylor family attorney John Gomez told CNN affiliate KGTV in San Diego that as part of the settlement, Toyota did not admit liability. An investigation revealed the accelerator pedal in the car probably became trapped on an all-weather floor mat that had been incorrectly installed in the vehicle. Toyota issued a recall to address possible floor mat entrapment. A 911 recording obtained by KGTV reveals a desperate call from inside the car as it approached the end of the freeway. ""We're in trouble. We can't ... there's no brakes,"" Chris Lastrella said. ""End freeway half mile."" CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","NEW: Attorney: Toyota does not admit liability .

540,"(CNN) -- Militants in Pakistan's tribal region attacked a truck carrying supplies for NATO troops in Afghanistan -- killing the driver and his assistant, officials said Friday. Gunmen opened fire and threw petrol bombs, setting the truck and its container on fire, said Muhammad Arshad Khan, a senior government official in Khyber Agency. They then fatally shot the occupants of the truck, Khan said. The torched truck was part of two-truck convoy headed toward the Torkham border crossing. The second truck was not damaged in the incident. Pakistan had closed off the crossing after U.S. helicopter strikes across the border killed two Pakistani soldiers. But it was reopened Sunday. It is the main land route for NATO supplies crossing from Pakistan to Afghanistan. Convoys have repeatedly come under militant fire in recent days. Since October 1, at least six people have been killed in attacks on supply vehicles -- in addition to the latest casualties. The convoys are generally operated by contracted Pakistani firms, using Pakistani trucks and drivers. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for some of the attack, saying they were in retaliation for drone strikes. The group said it has set up a special squad to hit U.S. interests in Pakistan, especially NATO supply efforts. The latest suspected drone strike came Friday when four alleged militants were killed in North Waziristan, two Pakistani intelligence officials said. Two missiles hit a vehicle in the area of Machi Khel in the district -- one of seven in Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. The intelligence officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media.","NEW: Drone strike kills 4 in tribal region .

541,"(CNN) -- A man ""angered"" by Manchester United's defeat to Barcelona in the final of the Champions League killed four people when he drove a minibus into a crowd celebrating the Spanish side's victory, police in Nigeria have told CNN. Barcelona fans celebrate in the city's Las Ramblas thoroughfare early Thursday morning. Ten people were also injured in the incident in the town of Ogbo, where the driver was subsequently arrested, a Port Harcourt Police spokesperson said. ""He was displaying his anger at his team losing the match. The driver had passed the crowd then made a U-turn and ran into them,"" spokesperson Rita Inomey-Abbey said. Both Manchester United and Barcelona have a large fan base across the African continent, with millions tuning in to watch European football on a weekly basis. Meanwhile, more than 100 people were arrested in Barcelona city center in the early hours of Thursday morning following the Catalan team's 2-0 victory in Rome in the final of Europe's top club competition. Police arrested 119 young people after violence flared at a special celebration party in Place de Catalunya near the Las Ramblas thoroughfare, while 238 people suffered minor injuries. City officials estimated the damage at up to 100,000 euros ($140,000) as the youths attacked police with bottles and damaged shops, parks and public utilities such as lamp-posts. The trouble took some of the gloss off the achievement of Barcelona, who became the first team to win the Champions League, Spanish League and Spanish Cup titles in one season. Manager Josep Guardiola led the club to glory in his first season in charge, ending a period of three years without a trophy.","Man drives minibus into a crowd celebrating Barcelona's Champions League win .

543,"CNN -- Ajax midfielder Evander Sno has suffered a heart attack whilst playing in a reserve match against Vitesse Arnhem on Monday. A statement on the club's website said the 23-year-old Dutch midfielder had to be resuscitated before later being transferred to hospital, where he is expected to stay for two weeks. The incident occurred after 60 minutes with Sno, who came on as a half-time substitute, having to be resuscitated three times. As a result of the former Celtic player's trauma the match was abandoned and he was treated on the pitch for more than ten minutes before regaining consciousness. Sno has played in for Bristol City in England, following earlier spells with NAC Breda and Feyenoord. Spain international Antonio Puerta died in 2007 after suffering a heart attack in his club side Sevilla's 4-1 win against Getafe. In 2004, Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe died after collapsing during an international match in France.","Ajax's Evander Sno suffers a heart attack during a reserve match on Monday .

544,"New York (CNN) -- A girl taken to a clinic for a skin rash had to be treated with a drug cocktail to prevent HIV and hepatitis after she was accidentally pricked by contaminated needles on the floor, according to the attorney for the family. Hailey Rodriguez, who turned 3 on Monday, is sick from the side effects of the drug cocktail she was given by Montefiore Medical Center after the ordeal, Susan Karten, Maklad's attorney told CNN. Nadia Maklad took her daughter to the Montefiore Medical Pavilion in the Bronx on October 7 because Hailey had a minor skin rash. Maklad was talking to the doctor in the examination room when she heard her daughter screaming and crying. ""I asked her what happened. She lifted up her dress, her stomach was bleeding and her hand was bleeding. She pointed to a bin: it was a red bio hazard bin on the floor,"" Maklad told CNN. ""The top wasn't securely on, the opening where you put the needles was broken, the bin was full of uncapped dirty needles."" Steve Osborne, a spokesman for Montefiore, told CNN, ""We've been consulting with the family regarding the incident, and working with them to see that appropriate care is provided."" ""How this could happen at an institution like Montefiore is beyond me,"" Susan Karten, Maklad's attorney told CNN. Rodriguez is at risk for HIV infecton and hepatitis; she is taking the drug cocktail as preventative treatment as it takes six months to find out if she is infected with HIV, Karten explained to CNN.","New York girl had to be treated with a drug cocktail to prevent HIV and hepatitis .

545,"(CNN) -- An oil pipeline that on September 9 began leaking crude oil just southwest of Chicago, Illinois, was back up and running Friday morning, owner Enbridge Energy Partners LP announced. The line, 6A, runs from Superior, Wisconsin, to Griffith, Indiana, and transports 670,000 barrels per day, according to Enbridge. The company this summer has had to close three pipelines to investigate and/or make repairs. The first and largest was a rupture in line 6B that dumped more than 800,000 gallons into Michigan's Kalamazoo River. The company also shut down a pipeline this Monday after oil was detected near a construction site, but the company noted this incident did not appear to be a leak as the investigation stemmed from the discovery of less than a gallon of oil. Spills spark spikes in gasoline prices . Large or small, pipeline incidents have been grabbing headlines, not to mention the eyes of politicians. And since there's about 200,000 miles of liquid pipeline and 300,000 of gas lines, it's an issue than can affect just about every part of the country. The recent liquid pipeline failures in combination with the deadly gas pipeline explosion and fire that killed four people in San Bruno, California, helped lead to a Wednesday hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, where politicians voiced concerns over the industry's regulatory standards. More questions surround California gas line . ""This is a very timely hearing, as we are unfortunately experiencing a high level of pipeline accidents that have caused significant death and destruction,"" said Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Florida, chair of the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. ""Our subcommittee ... has found significant problems with reporting and inspections,"" she said. Enbridge has taken significant heat over the notion that it waited too long to report the incident. ""The spill likely occurred sometime the day before Enbridge reported it to the National Response Center,"" said Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minnesota, chair of the committee. He noted that in a hearing prior to the spill in Michigan, Enbridge's vice president of U.S. operations touted his company's ability to detect problems in the pipes. Oberstar cited Adam's quote from the previous hearing: ""Our response time from our control center can be almost instantaneous, and our large leaks are typically detected by our control center personnel."" The pipe ruptured 10 days after he made that statement. ""Enbridge knew about hundreds of defects in the line,"" Oberstar added, ""and we know that PHMSA [the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration] was made aware of them and failed to do anything to address Enbridge's inaction. That is not a culture of safety."" Denise Green, who testified at the hearing, wept as she described how she and her two daughters had been exposed to benzene, a volatile carcinogen, after the spill. ""My 12-year-old asks me frequently, 'Am I going to get cancer?'"" said Green during her testimony. ""The only way I can answer that is 'I don't know. The only thing we can do is pray that everything will be OK.'"" Residents near spill urged to evacuate . In his prepared testimony, Enbridge President and CEO Patrick Daniel said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the Michigan incident and that ""for Enbridge, no spill is acceptable."" The Detroit Free Press reported this week that the pipe that broke in Michigan had been marked for defects three times in the past five years but that, since those defects were declared to be minor, no repairs were required under current federal regulations. So, would more stringent rules make things any better? Perhaps, said leading industry analyst Richard Kuprewicz, but he said care should be taken not to enact rules simply as a means of punishment. ""We just want to be sure that those improvements are effective. We don't just want regulation for the sake of regulation,"" he said. Overall Kuprewicz said he feels gas pipelines need the most overhaul, for a combination of reasons. Part of it, he said, is because gas can do so much damage when it ignites. ""The gas guys have got to really come to the table and start saying, 'We've got an issue here. We've got to have more rational regulation.'"" Nonetheless, the majority of the hearing this week centered on liquid pipelines, which, Kuprewicz said, can certainly use ""incremental"" changes. He said he would see it as ""overkill"" to force companies to repair every problem. ""You can't eliminate all anomalies in a pipeline,"" he added. ""All pipelines corrode. The question is, does the operator have that corrosion under control so the pipeline doesn't go to failure?"" Kuprewicz also added that while it may seem like the companies should be able to more quickly identify an issue, it's not always so cut and dry. ""I've been in the control room operating this stuff. It's hard to find major releases, even ruptures, by pressure loss. There's so much information coming into these control rooms, so it isn't as easy as the public thinks it is."" He then added that he is by no means defending Enbridge over its response time in the Michigan spill. He concluded by saying the industry has taken a ""quantum leap"" forward over the years but ""it needs to continually progress because obviously we're getting these ruptures and it's not good."" ""Something is not right here."" The Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials is scheduled to hold a hearing on the Department of Transportation's inspection and enforcement of gas and hazardous liquid pipelines . -- CNN's Thom Patterson and CNNMoney's Aaron Smith contributed to this report .","Leaking Enbridge oil pipeline near Chicago back up and running, company says .

546,"(CNN)  -- Five years ago this month, Katrina hit New Orleans. What it created is a tale of two cities, the haves vs. the have-nots. Enormous progress in the city's Business District overshadows the lingering blight in the 9th Ward and St. Bernard Parish, where folks are still struggling to rebuild and many lots remain empty. Unfortunately, Katrina attacked the two poorest states in America, Mississippi and Louisiana. It destroyed or disrupted the economic engines of both states: their tourism, shipbuilding, fisheries, port operations industries and petroleum production in the Gulf. Katrina left about 1,836 people dead, destroyed about 275,000 homes in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana, and cost the federal government about $114 billion. But there is good news. Post-Katrina tax incentives have had a dramatic impact. The region has more hotels and restaurants than it had before the hurricane, and its major infrastructure -- sewer, water, public service buildings, police and fire departments, National Guard -- has new or rebuilt buildings. Federal money has transformed the schools in New Orleans, reorganizing them into charter schools, which are a far cry from pre-Katrina's dysfunctional schools operating in dilapidated buildings. Public health in New Orleans before Katrina meant treatment in run-down, understaffed public hospitals. Chief of those was Charity Hospital, known as ""Big Charity,"" the state-run teaching hospital for Louisiana State University Medical School. But it is no more. The Veterans Hospital, next to Big Charity, was also destroyed during Katrina. Afterward, much discussion revolved around whether to repair or replace Big Charity. The Federal Emergency Management Agency insisted on providing only repair money versus money to replace Charity with a hospital that could share a campus with a new Veterans Hospital. It took four years to get a FEMA decision on helping to pay for replacing Charity, yet during this period of indecision, the city and state public health systems built community-based clinics. This is a 21st-century medical system far superior to pre-Katrina hospital-based public health. New Orleans' levee and water control systems have been steadily improved by upgrading pumps with backup generators. Gates have been installed at critical canals to help block water from entering the city during storm surges. About 325 miles of levees are around the city and surrounding parish, and work on the levees continues. But seemingly intractable problems that affect the poorest residents still beset the city. Two years ago, during Hurricane Gustav, water was splashing over the levee protecting the 9th Ward, the neighborhood most devastated by Katrina. Gustav reminded us the city remains vulnerable to levee failure -- any levee is no match for nature. The enduring erosion of the coastline, caused by bad water management all the way from the upper Mississippi River and the coastal canals, erodes the marshes and leaves coastal Louisiana exposed to the full brunt of future hurricanes. Public safety and housing remain the most difficult issues. Crime is a major problem in the Big Easy, and the police department is under enormous strain. Several groups of New Orleans Police Department employees are under federal investigation, accused of abuse of power --  including murder charges. Today, in these tough economic times, police officers are being asked to accept a 10 percent pay cut. Most officers cannot take their police cars home without paying for that privilege. Public safety has a long way to go. Also, more bad than good has been said of Louisiana's ""Road Home"" program, designed to help displaced residents get back into their houses. The shining star of home rebuilding, instead, is the enormous amount of volunteers who work tirelessly to help poor folks get back into their homes. Many middle-class neighborhoods still include blighted houses. The only option for the owners, who don't have the cash to rebuild, is to tear them down. The 9th and 7th Wards and St. Bernard Parish have the worst problems. Many people remain frustrated with the ""Road Home"" program. Although some got enough money to rebuild, most complain that the amount of provided by insurance and FEMA falls far short of actual repair costs. FEMA used pre-Katrina values to determine repair costs, but the costs of building materials and labor were a lot higher after the hurricane. New Orleans also had one of the highest number of renters in the country, at about 37 percent of residents. Initially, FEMA did not provide funding to rebuild rented housing. The slow economy that followed Katrina put limits on the amount of cash for building affordable housing. Most of the city's public housing projects were demolished. The city and private companies are building mixed-use public housing, but most of the poor people I speak with are suspicious of the effort. The Business District is in better shape than ever, but the legacy of Katrina's destruction lives on in the poorer neighborhoods of the 9th Ward and St. Bernard Parish.

Rangel Gomez declared three days of mourning but called it a ""miracle"" that so many people survived. The survivors ""are with some problems, but they are alive, thank God,"" he said. Authorities had identified all but six of the deceased. A names of the victims would be withheld until they are all identified, Rangel Gomez said. The aircraft belongs to the government-owned Conviasa airline. Aerial photographs showed that the plane crashed in an industrial storage yard. Best Western hotel clerk Ivan Maradey said he saw the plane tumble into some power lines before hitting the ground and exploding. The aircraft was an ATR42, a twin-turboprop, short-haul airplane built in France and Italy, Rangel Gomez said. Conviasa Flight 2350 was en route from Isla Margarita to Guayana when it crashed, the governor said. The cause of the crash had not been determined and remained under investigation, Rangel Gomez said. He identified the pilot as Ramiro Cardenas. The officials made their comments on the CNN-affiliated Globovision TV station. Federal investigators arrived at the scene Monday afternoon to begin examining the crash site, the state-run AVN news agency reported.","Fifteen people confirmed dead, governor says .

548,"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- As the bodies of eight tourists killed in a bus hijacking in the Philippines arrived in Hong Kong, China, on Wednesday, the Hong Kong government urged citizens not to take their grief and anger out on Filipinos despite ""the poor way"" the hijacking was handled by authorities. The Cathay Pacific flight, which also carried eight survivors and 19 relatives as well as dozens of officials, was greeted by a large crowd on its arrival at Hong Kong International Airport. In a somber ceremony, bagpipers played ""Amazing Grace"" as coffins were carried from the plane and wreaths laid upon them. Several people were helped down a flight of stairs from the plane; one man's hand and arm were bandaged. Chief Secretary Henry Tang received the arrivals and then told reporters his government would urge its Philippine counterpart to conduct an ""comprehensive, thorough, and impartial"" investigation. ""The truth is the best consolation for the victims and their families,"" he said. He added that Hong Kong is prepared to aid the Philippine authorities during the investigation. ""In order to facilitate a fair and thorough understanding of the incident, we believe it is imperative that the investigation report should at least cover a detailed account of the whole incident; and a detailed account of the causes of death and injuries,"" he said. Two of three remaining hospitalized victims had been expected to be released from Philippine hospitals in time for the flight, but it was not known if they were on the plane that landed in Hong Kong.  A third, more seriously injured tourist, remained in an intensive care unit in the Philippines. Hong Kong's Chief Executive, Donald Tsang,  was to lead a ceremony to raise the flag and lower it to half-staff on  Thursday, and a three-minute period of silence was scheduled for 8 a.m.,  according to the Hong Kong government. Citizens were urged to join the ceremony or pay tribute in other ways during that time. Meanwhile, residents in the Philippines observed a national day of mourning Wednesday in the aftermath of this week's bus hijacking in Manila. Hong Kong's Equal Opportunities Commission said in a statement it ""understands the strong feelings of Hong Kong people on the poor way that the crisis had been handled by the Philippine authorities."" ""The EOC urges all members of the community to stay calm and, in line with our good tradition of tolerance and understanding, refrain from shifting our anger towards an innocent group, particularly the Filipinos who are living and traveling in Hong Kong,"" the statement said. ""The people of Hong Kong have every reason to take pride in the racial harmony of this city, and we should guard against any action that may cause racial hatred or discord."" Former police officer Rolando Mendoza, who was apparently upset about having lost his job, took hostage a busload of tourists from Hong Kong on Monday. Witnesses said Mendoza was initially willing to cooperate, but he was shot dead by police after authorities say he became violent and started shooting hostages. Rodolfo Matibay, district director of Manila police, took responsibility for how the incident was handled, saying he ordered the police assault on the bus, according to Gen. Leocaldo Santiago, regional director of Manila police. He has been placed on administrative leave while the case is being investigated. Four men and four women were killed in the standoff.  One passenger was critically wounded and six others were hospitalized with less serious injuries. The gunman had previously released nine of the hostages, including a mother and her three children, a man with diabetes and two photographers. The bus driver escaped. Santiago said police killed none of  the hostages, though a ballistics investigation has yet to be completed. Philippine President Benigno Aquino ordered all flags at public institutions in the Philippines, its embassies and consulates around the world lowered to half-staff. In Hong Kong, flags also were lowered and traders at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange paused in silence. The Chinese territory, meanwhile, issued a black travel alert for the Philippines, advising residents to avoid all travel there. The government's Home Affairs Department has set up 18 condolence points around Hong Kong to allow people to mourn the victims and offer messages of sympathy. Tsang made an appearance at one of them on Tuesday to observe a minute of silence. A Facebook page also honors the victims. At the Hong Kong Management Association David Li Kwok Po College, students and faculty remembered Jessie Leung, 14, who was killed along with her father and sister.  Her brother remains in critical condition; her mother also survived the incident. ""Jessie was a helpful girl -- cheerful, lovely, a good academic,"" said Catherine Chan, the school's development manager. ""We hope her brother will recover soon."" In Manila, a makeshift shrine was erected in front of the bus, with flowers left for the victims. The deadly standoff unfolded live on television, which the gunman was able to watch on a monitor on the bus. Santiago blamed the live broadcasts for contributing to the violence as the standoff quickly deteriorated while police surrounded the vehicle. ""We do not want to pass sweeping judgment or make early conclusions except to say that our intention to peacefully end this hostage drama was spoiled when the hostage-taker suddenly exhibited violent behavior and began shooting the hostages,"" Philippine National Police Chief Director Gen. Jesus A. Verzosa said Tuesday in a statement. National police said officials noted ""some observations and defects during their close monitoring of the unfolding events."" The statement did not provide details. However, it listed poor handling of the hostage negotiations; inadequate capability, skills, equipment and planning of the assault team; improper crowd control; inadequate training and competence of the assault team leader; and noncompliance to media relations procedures in hostage situations. ""The investigation has got to find out, what was the turning point? What happened?"" said Richard Gordon, chairman of the Philippine National Red Cross. Gordon said survivors said the situation inside the bus changed dramatically toward the end of the 10-hour standoff. ""Apparently the man went berserk. He was telling everybody he was not going to harm [them]. ... He said that nobody's going to get harmed. He said that he was probably going to die, but not the hostages,"" he said. Santiago said that Mendoza's family members spoke with him early in the standoff and that he appeared ""very reasonable and very psychologically stable."" Mendoza was a decorated police officer, winning several accolades. But his career spiraled downward when he was dismissed a year ago for extortion, Manila Vice Mayor Ikso Moreno said, and he wanted his motion for reconsideration to be heard. Moreno said that Mendoza's brother was arrested during the standoff because he was ""guilty of conspiring with his brother"" and allegedly helped instigate the shooting. Gordon said the brother's arrest may have pushed the gunman over the edge. ""When he saw his brother getting accosted by the policemen, he went berserk and he started firing,"" he said.

549,"(CNN) -- At least one tornado ripped through northeast Texas Sunday evening, destroying homes, turning over vehicles and knocking train cars off tracks, local authorities said. A tornado struck Rice Texas at 5:30 p.m., Navarro County Chief Deputy Mike Cox said. The twister destroyed three homes, damaged at least two more, turned over an 18-wheeler truck onto a passenger car and knocked cars from a freight train off their tracks, he said. It also caused extensive damage to Rice Elementary School. Four people were transported to the hospital with minor injuries, Cox said. In addition to ""significant damage"" from a tornado moving through Navarro County, witnesses have also spotted possible tornados in other parts of northeast Texas, the National Weather Service said. Betty Montgomery of the Lone Oak Fire Department said callers had reported a debris cloud and structural damage to homes, but authorities had not confirmed whether a tornado had touched down. At least one home in Lone Oak was destroyed, Red Cross spokeswoman Anita Foster said. Joey Romero, 24, said he and his girlfriend rode out the storm in the freezer of a Sonic restaurant at a service station in Rice. They were driving from Dallas to Houston when it started to hail, he said. ""We pulled over under some covering. Hail the size of golf balls started falling. Then, we saw hail the size of baseballs,"" he said. Someone screamed when they saw the tornado forming behind Sonic, he said. The wind roared and the station lost power. ""The first few seconds it was all sort of surreal. I couldn't really believe it was happening...We all walked back in the freezer. It was cold in there and there wasn't light and people were starting to cry,"" he said. The hail shattered car windows, Romero said. The second-year medical student at University of Texas, Houston, said he helped treat injuries. A police officer told him a truck and a car had flipped over on the highway. After several hours inside Sonic, Romero was on the road back to Houston late Sunday. ""Even now, we can see the storm off to the east of us. The sky is pitch black,"" he said. CNN's Jacqui Jeras, Catherine E. Shoichet and Jessica Jordan contributed to this report.","NEW: A tornado destroys homes and knocks train cars off their track .

550,"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Typhoon Megi cut a deadly path into Asia on Friday, triggering mudslides that killed seven people and trapped more than 400 others in automobiles in Taiwan, officials said. At least 23 people, including 19 passengers on a tour bus, remained missing Friday night, Taiwan's official Central News Agency reported. Rescuers were searching for the missing and providing food to other stranded tourists trapped in the mountainous region of northeastern Taiwan. Helicopters were able to evacuate about 70 people, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The driver and a passenger of a second tour bus were also listed as missing Friday after their vehicle was buried by a landslide, CNA reported. Soldiers were deployed to rescue those trapped, including about 200 visitors from China, said Cai Min, a spokesman for Taiwan's National Disaster Prevention and Protection Commission. More than two dozen travelers had been rescued by late afternoon Friday, officials said. The rock slides happened mainly along the Suhua Highway, in northeast Taiwan, Cai said. Megi, which killed at least 11 people in the Philippines, is expected to reach the Asian continent in southern China early Saturday, according to the Hong Kong Observatory. On the streets of Hong Kong, there were no signs of the typhoon yet. ""Although it is difficult to predict Megi's exact track, the public should stay alert and attend to their personal safety. They should stay away from the shoreline, avoid unnecessary outdoor activities and ensure drains are not blocked,"" acting Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok said. As precautions, crews in Hong Kong were deployed to pile sandbags, inspect and trim trees and check drains. Temporary shelters were being opened, and myriad boats were moored. Megi may be the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, the state-run Xinhua news agency has said. In southern China, strong gales arrived ahead of Megi. Domestic and international flights have been cancelled, and ferry services have been suspended in Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan, state-run China Daily said. In Guangdong, crews have fanned out to inspect reservoirs, dikes and water-conservation projects, in an effort to prevent storm-related injuries and deaths. Nearly 130,000 fishing boats have been recalled in Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan provinces, and more than 150,000 people have fled for safety in Fujian, according to Xinhua. Officials have issued the highest of four warnings, bracing for possible devastation in coastal areas, Xinhua said. The warning allows local officials six hours to evacuate residents, close schools and airports, and recall vessels that are considered at risk. On Thursday in the Philippines, lawmakers placed the province of Pangasinan under a state of emergency, to help municipalities recover from Megi, which was known in the Philippines as Typhoon Juan. The typhoon affected an estimated 258,844 Filipinos, leaving thousands homeless. CNN's Helena Hong contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 23 people are missing, including 19 on a tour bus .

551,"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Family members of 19 Chinese tourists, who went missing in Taiwan after Typhoon Megi triggered rock slides, are headed to the island, China's state media said Monday. The tourists from Zhuhai city in southern China went missing about 10 p.m. Thursday. Two other people -- a Taiwanese bus driver and a Chinese tour group leader from another tour bus -- also are missing, according to official Taiwanese media. Emergency crews rescued hundreds of other people who were trapped by the rock slides, which happened mainly along the Suhua Highway, in northeast Taiwan. Sections of the scenic highway, which is perched along a cliff on Taiwan's eastern coast, gave way. Typhoon Megi made landfall in China's southeastern province of Fujian on Saturday, affecting nearly 650,000 people and destroying 500 houses, China's Xinhua news agency said. About 270,000 people had evacuated. Damage in Fujian from the strongest typhoon of the year was estimated at 1.59 billion yuan ($238 million). No deaths or significant injuries were reported, thanks to rigorous typhoon precautions in Fujian, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, the state-run China Daily said Monday. Megi killed at least 13 people and injured nearly 100 others in Taiwan last week. It struck the Philippines earlier in the week, affecting an estimated 258,844 people and leaving thousands homeless.","Typhoon Megi triggers the rock slides .

552,"(CNN) -- A major rainstorm washed over the water-weary Northeast Tuesday, flooding much of the already saturated region but focusing its withering power on the tiny state of Rhode Island. ""Right now, most of our eyes are on the Pawtuxet River in Cranston,"" said Tom Econopouly, a senior hydrologist at the Northeast River Forecast Center in nearby Taunton, Massachusetts. The river was predicted to crest Wednesday morning near 20 feet -- flood stage is 9 feet, he said, adding, ""It's very high."" Another record was set in Yantic, Connecticut, where the Yantic River crested Tuesday at 13.6 feet, 4.6 feet above flood stage, he said. Yet another record was predicted for Saxonville, Massachusetts, where the Sudbury River was expected to reach 13.4 feet Wednesday afternoon. Flood stage is 10 feet. ""I've been working here for over 10 years and I really haven't seen anything like this in my career,"" Econopouly said. Is it flooding near you? Share photos, videos and stories . The cause of all the records was a storm system ""that just didn't move"" since it formed Sunday night, he said. By late Tuesday, the storm was lifting, but several rivers had not yet crested, he said. In all, the storm system dumped 8.75 inches of rain in East Providence, 7.6 inches in downtown Providence, and 5 inches in Cranston, all in Rhode Island, he said. Compounding the misery was the fact that parts of the region were still trying to shake off the effects of a storm two weeks ago. And this week's system -- with heavy winds and rain -- has left thousands of customers without power. On the National Weather Service map posted on its Web site, the coast was covered in bright green from Maine to Delaware, indicating widespread flood warnings. ""We haven't seen the worst of it yet,"" Rhode Island Gov. Donald Carcieri told reporters Tuesday night after seven to eight inches of rain had inundated much of the state. He pleaded with state residents to stay off the roads. ""We are very concerned about flooding on the highways,"" he said. The Blackstone River in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and the Pawcatuck River in Charleston, Rhode Island, were not expected to crest until 8 a.m. Wednesday, he said. ""None of us alive have seen the kind of flooding we are experiencing now,"" he said, calling the downpour an event that occurs once every 100 years to 500 years. Sewage treatment plants around the state were swamped, with one in Warwick, Rhode Island, ""completely inundated,"" he said. That led the Department of Health to order the closure of all beaches in the state. Emergency officials asked residents of affected areas to try to conserve water. Decisions about school closings were to be announced in the morning, he said. Carcieri urged residents of low-lying areas not to jeopardize their safety by refusing to comply with officials' requests to evacuate. He noted that some members of the National Guard have been deployed to help. Cranston Mayor Allan Fung said about 120 homes had been evacuated in the western part of the city. Dam safety was to be monitored overnight, said Dave Smith, director of the Emergency Management Agency. ""The water that's running through the throats of some of those dams is remarkable,"" he said. A spokesman for National Grid Energy Services said 12,000 to 14,000 customers were without electricity in the Cranston area, where a substation was underwater. In Westerly, Rhode Island, another 9,600 customers were in the dark, the spokesman said. He told area residents to expect rotating outages throughout the night and predicted they would continue for ""a period of days."" Gas was turned off in some areas, too, he said. Shelters have been set up throughout the state, said Rhode Island Lt. Governor Elizabeth Roberts. ""We are looking at historic levels,"" said Luke Peterson, the assistant town manager for West Warwick, Rhode Island. The Pawtuxet River in Cranston and West Warwick, about 13 miles southwest of Providence, flooded a few weeks ago at record levels. This time, Peterson said, the town has received reports predicting that the river, which reaches flood stage at 9 feet, will crest at 17.5 feet at nearby Cranston. The river crested at 14.98 feet more than two weeks ago. ""There's not a whole lot we can do,"" Peterson said. ""If we try to hold back on our side, we'd make it worse for the neighboring community."" Still, no deaths have been reported in Rhode Island. That was also the case in Massachusetts, where four to seven inches of rain had fallen in the eastern part of the state during this latest storm, said Scott MacLeod, a public information officer with the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency in Framingham, Massachusetts. Most of the flooding in Massachusetts occurred in the Bay State's southeastern corner county of Bristol, Massachusetts, where about 200 people were evacuated, he said. On Monday, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard, which was prepared to assist overnight, MacLeod said. A handful of shelters were open, though few people were staying there, and there were no reports of power outages in the state, MacLeod said. ""It's mainly flooding issues -- closed roads, flooded roadways and basements."" Though the rain was expected to stop overnight in Massachusetts, ""the flooding will continue throughout the week for a number of our rivers and streams,"" MacLeod predicted. The storm delayed flights at Boston's Logan International Airport, all three New York-area airports and Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's Web site. Connecticut Gov. Jodi Rell said she was putting the state National Guard on alert to assist with flood control and sandbagging efforts. By Tuesday night, a spokesman for the state's Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security said rivers were still rising. ""We do have significant flooding in the southeastern part of the state,"" said public information officer Scott DeVico. Particularly affected were the areas around the Connecticut cities of Norwich, Stonington and Groton City, he said. But no fatalities had been reported and fewer than 400 customers were without power, he said. Though no major highways were shut, a number of secondary roads were closed in low-lying areas, he said. In New Jersey, the city of Wayne issued a flood warning but said it was not issuing evacuations. In Paterson, New Jersey, minor flooding was reported, the city fire department said. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the Delaware Valley, the National Weather Service issued a coastal flood advisory.","Pawtuxet River in Cranston, Rhode Island may crest 11 feet above flood stage .

553,"(CNN) -- Two planes collided in midair Saturday in Boulder, Colorado, killing three people, authorities said. One of the planes, a single-seat Piper Pawnee, was towing a glider. The pilot of the Piper died in the collision, said Rick Brough of the Boulder County Sheriff's Office. But the pilot of the glider, which was carrying two passengers, detached from the plane and landed safely, Brough said. Two people on the second plane, a Cirrus SR 20, also died, Brough said. Authorities began receiving reports of a plane crash around 1:30 p.m. MT, Brough said, adding that people had seen flames in the air in an area less than five miles from the Boulder Municipal Airport. The collision was described as ""immediate disintegration and explosion of both planes,"" said Jennifer Rodi, an air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. Rodi called the glider's occupants ""very lucky"" during a news conference Sunday and praised the glider's pilot. ""The glider was attached to the Piper Pawnee when the pilot observed the Cirrus aircraft out of the corner of his eye,"" she said. ""He immediately noted they were on a collision course and elected to separate the tow strap from the Piper Pawnee."" ""He did his job that he signed up for as a commercial pilot,"" Rodi said. Rodi said the Cirrus was traveling south and the Pawnee was traveling west at the time of the collision. The debris field was spread out over a couple of miles, Brough said. ""I was in my house and I heard a loud bang,"" iReporter Zac Mitchell, of Boulder, told CNN. ""I looked out my window and saw a giant fireball in the sky."" When he went outside, he said he saw smoke and two objects, including a parachute, falling from the sky. Cirrus aircraft come equipped with an airframe parachute system that deploys in the event of an in-air emergency. It's designed to safely lower the plane to the ground. The NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration are involved in investigating the incident, Brough said. CNN's Leslie Tripp, John Branch and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Three people were killed Saturday in a midair collision over Boulder, Colorado .

554,"(CNN) -- Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger asked the White House to make a federal disaster declaration in the aftermath of last week's pipeline explosion and fire in San Bruno, California, his office said Wednesday. ""This event has destroyed and caused serious damages to homes, infrastructure, and other public facilities in San Mateo County,"" Schwarzenegger said in a letter to President Obama. ""The response and recovery costs for this event are estimated at nearly $10.4 million."" A disaster declaration from the White House would free federal funds to cover those costs. The request came as a consumer watchdog group said pipeline owner Pacific Gas & Electric had planned in 2009 to replace a section of its gas pipeline just a couple of miles from the section that exploded, but never spent the $5 million in rate increases to do the work. TURN [The Utility Reform Network] also said the utility asked for another $5 million for the same project in 2009 -- the year it should have completed the work it hasn't even started -- saying it wouldn't be completed until 2013. ""The money was spent on what they call higher priority work,"" said TURN senior attorney Mike Florio. ""You can't track the dollars one by one, but we do know they spent $62 million more on management incentive business than they had forecast in 2009,"" he said. ""They spent $60 million on going back and re-doing gas leak surveys that they had botched elsewhere on their system."" PG&E responded that it ""is committed to performing the work necessary to assure the safety of its gas transmission system."" The utility said it had identified the line section as a ""high priority project"" in the earlier transmission rate filing, but ""rescheduled the project"" after an updated assessment in 2009. But the company did not explain why it needed an additional $5 million and three years to complete repairs on a section it said, in its most recent rate filing, was in the top 100 risks for failure. ""Coupled with the consequences of failure of this section of pipeline, the likelihood of a failure makes the risk of a failure at this location unacceptably high,"" the company said in that filing. TURN officials think they know where some of the money went -- in 2009, the year PG&E didn't spend $5 million on fixing the pipeline, the company did spend $5 million on bonuses for six top executives. ""The company's priorities appear to be skewed,"" TURN executive director Mark Toney said. The line that exploded in San Bruno was laid down in 1948, as was the section PG&E was supposed to replace. In the first filing, the utility noted that the ""vintage 30-inch pipeline"" runs through ""several High Consequence Areas."" In the second, it said the pipeline was ""located in a heavily urbanized area."" Four people were killed in the September 9 explosion and fire in the San Francisco suburb, and three are still missing. The blast blew in the doors of a grocery store a quarter-mile (400 meters) away, and the explosion and resulting fire injured 52 people and destroyed 37 homes. The explosion blew a 28-foot section of the pipeline 100 feet in the air. In the filing documents provided by TURN, the section of pipe to be replaced is identified as in the top 100 for highest risks of failure. Since exact locations of pipelines are generally kept secret because of terrorism threats, residents may not even know they live near one until it's too late. ""If they fixed that section that they said wanted to fix maybe they would have found something that led them to look a mile or two south of there,"" Florio said. ""We don't know that. We do know that the project was slated for 2009. It didn't get done. Now they're proposing to do it again in 2013."" The California Public Utilities Commission has not made a decision on this latest increase request. PG&E has agreed to set up a $100 million fund to help rebuild parts of San Bruno.

555,"(CNN) -- South Korea's Red Cross has offered $8.4 million in flood aid to North Korea, the Yonhap news agency said Tuesday. The aid includes medical kits, food and emergency supplies, South Korea Unification Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung told reporters. The Red Cross is Seoul's main channel for humanitarian aid to North Korea. The communist nation has not replied to the offer, Chun was quoted as saying. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies blamed a flash flood for displacing more than 23,000 people in a North Korean province bordering China. ""The whole city of Sinuiju with its 350,000 residents is without piped drinking water at the moment because the main pumping station was inundated,"" said Henk Schipper, Red Cross water and sanitation delegate in North Korea. In August, nearly 260,000 people in northeastern China and North Korea fled their homes as heavy rains caused the Yalu River to overflow its banks, state news outlets in those countries reported Sunday. Tensions between North Korea and its southern neighbor have escalated since a May report from Seoul blamed North Korea for the sinking of a South Korean warship in March. The report, whose findings have been endorsed by the United States, alleged that a North Korean sub sank the ship, the Cheonan, with a torpedo, killing 46 sailors. North Korea denies it was responsible for the sinking.","The Red Cross is South Korea's channel for aid to North Korea .

556,"(CNN) -- Manchester United winger Antonio Valencia could return to action in February, manager Alex Ferguson told the English Premier League club's official website. Valencia dislocated and fractured his left ankle after tangling with Rangers defender Kirk Broadfoot in a UEFA Champions League match on Tuesday, and it was feared he may miss the remainder of the season. However, Ferguson allayed these concerns, saying the injury was not as bad as first thought. ""Antonio had his operation and it was successful. The break was clean and we were delighted to announce that. It was a major concern for us at the time."" The 68-year-old Scot is hopeful Valencia may still be able to play a part in the Premier League season, and has praised the attitude of the former Wigan player. ""There is ligament damage but we are looking at the end of February, which is better than we thought on Tuesday night. He is a strong boy and he is very positive about it -- being positive helps in these situations.""","Manchester United's Antonio Valencia is expected to be out of action  until February .

557,"(CNN) -- More state restrictions on fishing in the Gulf of Mexico were lifted Monday as the fall shrimping season began, but efforts to permanently plug the ruptured BP oil well were delayed again. The worst oil spill in U.S. history has hobbled fishermen across the Gulf as federal and state authorities put much of its waters off-limits due to safety concerns. With the well capped on a temporary basis for a month, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the Gulf states have begun lifting those restrictions -- but Louisiana shrimpers like Anthony Bourgeoif say more needs to be done, and soon. ""It's open down over here with small shrimp, where it should be open over there where the big shrimp are,"" Bourgeoif told CNN. ""Can't make no money with no little shrimp, man."" Bourgeoif said he planned to go out, because ""I ain't made nothing since the BP spill."" But he was concerned that inspectors might find signs of oil in his catch and make him dump it. ""So why go out there and catch it if they're just going to be dumped, and I ain't going to make no money off it?"" he asked. ""I've got to make money. I've got four grandkids I'm raising, man."" Deborah Long, a spokeswoman for the Southern Shrimp Alliance, said it will likely take days to assess what impact the spill has had on the Gulf catch. And while some shrimpers are eager to get back out, many are still working for the well's owner, BP, which has hired many boats to skim oil off the surface and lay protective booms along the shorelines. And concerns about the long-term impact of the spill persisted with a new report from researchers at the University of South Florida, who reported that oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill may have settled to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico further east than previously suspected -- and at levels toxic to marine life. Initial findings from a new survey of the Gulf conclude that dispersants may have sent droplets of crude to the ocean floor, where it has turned up at the bottom of an undersea canyon within 40 miles of the Florida Panhandle. The results are scheduled to be released Tuesday, but CNN obtained a summary of the initial conclusions Monday night. Plankton and other organisms at the base of the food chain showed a ""strong toxic response"" to the crude, and the oil could well up onto the continental shelf and resurface later, according to researchers. ""The dispersant is moving the oil down out of the surface and into the deeper waters, where it can affect phytoplankton and other marine life,"" said John Paul, a marine microbiologist at USF. The spill erupted April 20 with an explosion that sank the offshore drilling platform Deepwater Horizon. The blast killed 11 men and uncapped an undersea gusher that spewed an estimated 205 million gallons of oil into the Gulf before it was temporarily shut in July 15. Thad Allen, the federal government's point man in the Gulf, said Monday that attempts to permanently seal the well won't start until the latest potential problem is evaluated. Allen said engineers are now concerned about how to manage the risk of pressure in the annulus, a ring that surrounds the casing pipe at the center of the well shaft. The ""timelines won't be known until we get a recommendation on the course of action,"" Allen said. Scientists began new pressure tests last week to gauge the effects of the mud and cement poured into the well from above during the ""static kill"" procedure that started August 3. From those pressure readings, they believe that either some of the cement breached the casing pipe and leaked into the annulus, or cement came up into the annulus from the bottom. The scientists believe that process may have trapped some oil between the cement and the top of the well, inside the annulus. Now, given that new variable, they're trying to figure out how to safely maintain the pressure within the well before launching the ""bottom kill,"" a procedure aimed at sealing the well from below. Allen told reporters that when it comes to giving a green light to the ""bottom kill"" of the well through the nearby relief well, ""nobody wants to make that declaration any more than I do."" But the process ""will not start until we figure out how to manage the risk of pressure in the annulus."" ""We're using an overabundance of caution,"" he said. Allen said crews could remove the capping stack that sealed the oil in the well on July 15, then replace the well's blowout preventer with a new one stored on the nearby Development Driller II in the Gulf. Allen said a new blowout preventer would be ""rated at much higher pressure levels than the annulus."" The other option would require BP to devise a pressure-relief device for the current capping stack. Once crews get their marching orders, it will take them about 96 hours to prepare, drill the final 50 feet of a relief well and intercept the main well. Then, the bottom kill process of plugging the well from below would begin. BP acknowledged Monday that the disruption the oil spill has caused to lives across the Gulf coast has built up tension among residents.  In response, the company announced Monday it is providing a total of $52 million to five behavioral health support and outreach programs. BP released a statement saying it would give the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration $10 million; the Florida Department of Children and Families, $3 million; the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, $15 million; and the departments of mental health in Mississippi and Alabama, $12 million each. ""We appreciate that there is a great deal of stress and anxiety across the region, and as part of our determination to make things right for the people of the region, we are providing this assistance now to help make sure individuals who need help know where to turn,"" said Lamar McKay, president of BP America and incoming leader of BP's Gulf Coast Restoration Organization.

558,"(CNN) -- It is a problem of massive plastic proportions -- a giant floating debris field, composed mostly of bits and pieces of plastic, in the northwest Pacific Ocean, about a thousand miles off the coast of California. Researchers recover nets from the Pacific Ocean on August 3, 2009. It's called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and it covers a vast area of hundreds, maybe even thousands, of miles of open ocean. Now researchers are trying to learn more about the sea-bound trash zone and perhaps find answers to basic questions. A crew of scientists from the University of California's Scripps Institution of Oceanography has embarked on a three-week mission aboard the research vessel New Horizon, heading for the debris field to study it. The mission is not as straightforward as it sounds. ""There may be a misapprehension ... that if you got out there and stood on the middle of a deck you'd see nothing but plastic litter from horizon to horizon,"" said Robert Knox, deputy director for research at the Scripps Institution. ""It's relatively sparse, and you might or might not see something visible to the human eye at any particular location out there,"" Knox says. ""Certainly one does encounter pieces of plastic stuff that are big enough to see. But the other side of the puzzle is all the little bits and pieces of plastic that you can't even see unless you scoop up a sample of seawater and see what's in there."" ""I think it's a little misleading to think of it as a great big island that you could practically get out and walk on, but the point is it's a big area of ocean. So even a few pieces of plastic per square meter amounts to a lot of plastic when you add it up over this enormous ocean area."" There has been some previous research on this garbage field, but not much. It's been very poorly studied in a scientific sense. Major questions remain: . How how much stuff is there? What size is the stuff? Where is it distributed in the ocean, at the surface or at what depth? What does it do to the food chain, especially the small particles of plastic that may be ingested by smaller organisms at the bottom of the food chain? While the main focus of the Scripps mission is the impact of this plastic trash on marine life, researchers will gather information on a wide variety of issues. Here's what scientists do know: They know the size of this zone is huge, maybe as big as Texas. And they know that all the plastic accumulated in the patch has mostly broken down into smaller bits, floating just under the water's surface like confetti, basically a soupy mix of plastic-filled seawater that stretches for maybe thousands of miles. They know the garbage patch has been growing for many years, and scientists first became aware of the problem years ago when fisherman reported encountering widespread debris. They know there are other debris fields in other oceans of the world, but this one is the biggest. Rusty Brainard with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says this giant garbage patch, in addition to plastic, also contains huge masses of fishing nets, which destroys ecosystems around the Hawaiian Islands. But the plastic is really the toxic killer. While it slowly degrades, it turns into increasingly smaller bits of plastic. Seabirds mistake it for food and they dive down and eat it. Brainard says they find a lot of skeletons of seabirds on the Islands and ""their gut content is just filled with plastic."" Brainard says that has scientists wondering what other animals are eating this plastic. As the larger animals and marine life eat the smaller animals, this plastic eventually ends up in the human food supply, too. But even the size is of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is uncertain. ""It's not a hard and fast number. It's a little bit like a whirlpool on the surface of a river or a lake. You'd be hard-pressed to tell me where the edge is. All you know is that it's stronger in the middle than it is in the outer reaches. But it's an area of many hundreds of miles -- perhaps thousands -- in which the ocean currents tend to bring it together,"" according to Knox. NOAA has tracked the Great Pacific Garbage Patch movement to some degree. Scientists know it moves as much as a thousand miles north and south in the Pacific seasonally. And during warmer ocean periods, known as El Nino, it drifts even further south. A kind of large, clock-wise circulation of currents driven by the wind around the Pacific ocean basin causes the plastic and other garbage to mix together in convergence zones, forming this giant trash zone and making its movements comparable to a whirlpool. Researchers believe this enormous trash zone accumulated over many years from trash being dumped off boats and ocean-going ships, and from trash accumulated on beaches, where it eventually washed in the Pacific Ocean and into the huge zone. This study mission may even help scientists determine whether there's any way to clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and, if so, the best way to do it.

559,"Los Angeles, California (CNN)  -- Corey Haim seemed to be winning his battle against drug abuse in the weeks before his death, his manager and closest friend said Wednesday. The 1980s teen movie actor and heartthrob died early Wednesday after collapsing in the Los Angeles apartment he shared with his mother, authorities said. Haim was ""weaned down to literally zero medications"" in the last two weeks by an addiction specialist, manager Mark Heaslip said on HLN's ""Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell."" The doctor ""put him on a new line of medications,"" Haim's longtime friend and frequent co-star Corey Feldman said on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Feldman pleaded with people not to draw conclusions that Haim died from a drug overdose. He said that until the autopsy report is issued, ""nobody knows and nobody's going to know."" ""I know that there were symptoms that he was showing that expressed it could be a number of things,"" Feldman said. ""This could have been a kidney failure. This could have been a heart failure."" Heaslip said Haim's mother, Judy, told him ""there were no signs of him overdosing."" His death came as his career was picking up, with Haim booking ""movie after movie,"" Heaslip said. His latest film is set for release soon, he said. Haim ""really became a man"" in recent months as he helped his mother in her battle with cancer, Feldman said. ""He's been there for her, taking care of her, being responsible,"" he said. Haim, 38, was taken to Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, early Wednesday, where he was pronounced dead at 2:15 a.m., Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Ed Winter said. Haim was in the apartment he shared with his mother, Judy, when he ""became a little dizzy, he kind of went to his knees in the bedroom,"" Winter said. ""His mom assisted him in the bed. He became unresponsive."" His mother called paramedics to the apartment, which is between Hollywood Hills and Burbank, he said. Los Angeles Police Sgt. Frank Albarran said earlier that Haim's death appeared to be accidental and may have been because of an overdose. Haim had suffered flu-like symptoms for two days, the deputy coroner said . ""We found no illicit drugs; however, we did recover four of his prescription meds at the location,"" Winter said, adding he does not know what those drugs were. An autopsy, including toxicology tests, will be conducted Wednesday, Winter said. It is likely to be weeks before any conclusions are made public. The actor was under the care of his doctor, who visited him Tuesday night, as well as another doctor who specializes in treating addictions, Heaslip said. Feldman said he was angry about how Haim has been snubbed in recent years by the entertainment industry. He was broke, without a car and living in a month-to-month rental apartment with his mother, he said. ""We build people up as children, we put them on pedestals and then when we decide that they are not marketable anymore, we walk away from them,"" he said. Haim's most famous role was in the 1987 movie ""The Lost Boys,"" in which he appeared with Feldman. Haim played the role of a fresh-faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire. In later years, the two friends, who appeared in eight movies together, struggled with drug abuse and went their separate ways. They reunited for a reality show, ""The Two Coreys,"" in 2007, but A&E Network canceled the program after slightly more than a year. In a 2007 interview on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Haim and Feldman discussed their battle with drugs. Feldman told King that he had gotten clean, but it took Haim longer. Haim called himself ""a chronic relapser for the rest of my life."" ""I think I have an addiction to pretty much everything,"" he said. ""I mean, I have to be very careful with myself as far as that goes, which is why I have a support group around me consistently."" iReport: Share your memories of Haim . In 2008, Feldman told People magazine that he would no longer speak to Haim until his former co-star got sober. In a clip from ""The Two Coreys,"" Feldman and his wife, along with two other former teen stars, called on Haim in an effort to get him to admit he needed help, the magazine said. The meeting followed an incident in which Haim, scheduled to film a cameo appearance in a direct-to-DVD sequel to ""The Lost Boys,"" appeared on the set ""clearly under the influence,"" People reported. Feldman told King on Wednesday that he renewed his contact with Haim in the past year because of the progress he made against his addiction. Haim was born December 23, 1971, in Toronto, Ontario, according to a biography on his Web site. He made his first television appearance in 1982 on the Canadian series ""The Edison Twins."" His first film role was in the 1984 American movie ""First Born."" Haim also won rave reviews for his title role in the 1986 film ""Lucas."" Film critic Roger Ebert said of him at the time, ""If he continues to act this well, he will never become a half-forgotten child star, but will continue to grow into an important actor."" After ""The Lost Boys,"" Haim and Feldman appeared in ""License to Drive"" and ""Dream a Little Dream.""","Cause of actor Corey Haim's death unknown .

Floods damaged crops and hindered transportation leaving passengers stranded in trains and blocking roadways, and flood waters covered more than 150,000 homes, VNA reported. Seven died in Ha Tinh province after Sunday's rainfall reached more that 800 millimeters (31.5 inches), according to VietNamNet. The province accounted for more than half the homes reported flooded. A similar amount of rain fell on Nghe An province, triggering flooding that killed eight people but inundating far fewer homes, VietNamNet reported. Four more died in Quang Binh province. One person has been reported missing in this week's floods. Throughout the region, people and cattle could be seen sitting on roofs, while boats floated through what would otherwise have been the nation's streets. About 1 meter of water lay over some parts of a Highway 1A, a north-south connection through Vietnam, and service on the north-south railway through the southeastern Asian nation was suspended, reported state-run Vietnam News. The Vietnamese government is distributing 2,000 tons of rice and $10 million worth of aid to the worst-hit areas, in Ha Trinh and Quang Binh provinces, reports said. Record-setting rains a few weeks earlier in central Vietnam spurred severe flooding that killed 66 people and inundated more than 10,000 dwellings. Hundreds of Vietnamese troops were dispatched to the region in the first week of October to help with rescue operations and help residents and business owners deal with millions of dollars of damage.","Heavy rains and severe flooding in central Vietnam led to the deaths of 20 people .

561,"(CNN) -- Help trickled in Thursday, three days after a magnitude-7.7 earthquake struck off Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that has killed at least 311 people and left more than 400 missing. An assessment team from the nonprofit group SurfAid International had reached the disaster zone, but the area's remoteness prevented further contact with headquarters in Sumatera Barat, Indonesia. SurfAid had shipped 1,000 shelter kits to victims, and is preparing to send more supplies once communication is established, spokeswoman Jossi Syahrial said Thursday. The group was trying to work with government officials to establish an information and coordination hub for all non-governmental organizations, she said. The hard-hit Mentawai Islands region is among Indonesia's myriad islands. ""It's very difficult"" to reach the region either by boat or road, said Andrew Judge, CEO of SurfAid. The trip takes at least 10 hours in good conditions, according to aid agencies. The Indonesian Red Cross also had sent at least two aid teams. One aid shipment included about 400 body bags. Urgent needs are expected to include clean water, food, blankets, clothing, medical attention, emergency shelter and hygiene kits, said Ita Balanda, a program manager for the World Vision aid organization in Padang, Indonesia. An estimated 7,900 households were affected, she said. ""The worst hit area is North and South Pagai Island. Reports of villages flattened are coming from there,"" said Antorizon of the West Sumatra disaster management agency, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. The first pictures from North Pagai Island showed damaged and flattened structures. Monday's quake generated a ""significant"" tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. Some of the missing might include people who are unaccounted for after fleeing to higher ground, said Henri Dori Satoko, head of the Mentawai Islands parliament. Though communication poses a challenge in the remote area, some witnesses in West Sumatra reported seeing a wave 6 meters (nearly 20 feet) high. Other reports described the tsunami as being about 3 meters (almost 10 feet) high. At least one village with a population of about 200 people was swept away, with only 40 people recovered, Satoko said. The quake struck at 9:42 p.m. Monday, triggering a tsunami warning. Its epicenter was 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Padang, at a depth of 20.6 kilometers (12.8 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The magnitude was revised upward from a preliminary magnitude of 7.5. ""On Mentawai, a [tsunami] warning was issued seven minutes after detection of earthquake, which is what the existing system is capable of doing. Preliminary report indicates the destructive waves hit the Mentawai Islands after five minutes. ... For Mentawai villagers, the warning is late, as they are very close to the tsunami source,"" said Sanny Jegillos of the U.N. Development Programme. He oversees the Indian Ocean tsunami warning system, including Indonesia. Indonesia's government has since warned residents of West Sumatra province to stay alert and stay away from the coastline for up to five days because of the possibility of more earthquakes, Balanda said. The city of Padang and the Mentawai Islands are at the meeting place of two tectonic plates, making them vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off northern Sumatra. A tsunami generated by that earthquake killed more than 225,000 people in 14 countries -- mainly India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The Indonesian region of Banda Aceh was hard-hit: About 150,000 died there. CNN's Kathy Quiano and Stan Grant contributed to this report.","The area's remoteness has limited help and communications .

562,"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Senior police officers failed to pursue extensive intelligence that indicated a Catholic priest was involved in one of Northern Ireland's worst terrorist attacks, an independent report concluded Tuesday. Nine people died and 30 were wounded July 31, 1972, when three bombs went off in the town of Claudy, in County Londonderry. The first was a car bomb that had been parked outside a local pub. Minutes later, bombs exploded outside a post office and a hotel, according to Irish state broadcaster RTE. No one was ever charged in the case, but there have long been suspicions that a Catholic priest was involved. Tuesday's report was issued by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, an independent body that investigates complaints against the police. The report found that, rather than acting on the information about the priest's possible involvement, the police sought the government's help in dealing with the Catholic Church. The police then accepted the government's ""understanding"" that was reported back to them, the report found. ""The consequence of their acquiescence was that the investigation was further compromised,"" wrote Al Hutchinson, the police ombudsman. ""The decision failed those who were murdered, injured, and bereaved in the bombing. The police officers who were working on the investigation were also undermined."" The priest at the center of the controversy was identified by the report as Father James Chesney, who died in 1980. According to the ombudsman's investigation, police had ""extensive intelligence"" after the bombing from which they concluded Chesney worked for the Irish Republican Army as its regional director of operations. Police also knew of allegations he had been directly involved in both the Claudy bombings and other terrorist incidents, the report found. That should have led the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) -- the police force in Northern Ireland at the time -- to pursue further investigation that could have either implicated or cleared the priest, the report said. A detective wanted to arrest Chesney in the months after the bombing, but an assistant chief constable turned down that request, the report found. That senior officer then suggested to the government that it hold a meeting with Catholic officials about the issue. A government official wrote to the RUC in December 1972 to say the secretary of state for Northern Ireland met with Cardinal William Conway to express ""disgust"" at the priest's behavior, and that the cardinal said he knew the priest was a ""very bad man."" The cardinal promised to see ""what could be done"" about the priest, including a possible transfer to another parish. Then-chief Constable Graham Shillington wrote back to say only that he had seen the letter about the meeting and preferred a transfer. Chesney was moved to a parish in the Republic of Ireland in late 1973. Church records indicate that when questioned by his superiors, Chesney denied involvement in terrorist activity, the report said. As a result of the way police handled the case, the report said, the priest's denials were never tested. Hutchinson, the ombudsman, said the decisions made by those in charge at the time have to be considered in the context of the time. He said 1972 was one of the worst years of violence in Northern Ireland and the arrest of a priest could have aggravated the security situation. Without more information about why the police failed to follow up the leads, however, Hutchinson said their actions look like a collusive act. ""The key police decision-makers referred to in this statement are deceased,"" he said. ""Had they been alive today, their actions would have demanded explanation, which would have been the subject of further investigation."" The report found no evidence of criminal intent on the part of any government or Catholic official. It also found no evidence that the police had information that could have prevented the bombings. In a joint statement, Cardinal Sean Brady, Archbishop of Armagh, and Bishop Seamus Hegarty said they accepted the report's findings and conclusions. They said the church had made all known material available to investigators. ""Throughout the Troubles (the 30-year period of violence in Northern Ireland), the Catholic Church, along with other churches in Northern Ireland, was constant in its condemnation of the evil of violence,"" they said. ""It is therefore shocking that a priest should be suspected of involvement in such violence. ""This case should have been properly investigated and resolved during Father Chesney's lifetime. If there was sufficient evidence to link him to criminal activity, he should have been arrested and questioned at the earliest opportunity, like anyone else. We agree with the police ombudsman that the fact this did not happen failed those who were murdered, injured and bereaved in the bombings."" They appealed for any information about other suspects in the case. ""Father Chesney is dead and, as a suspect in the Claudy bombing, he is beyond the justice of earthly courts,"" they said. ""Clearly a number of people were involved in the planning and carrying out of this terrible atrocity, some of whom may still be alive. Those bereaved and injured deserve to know the truth. We appeal to anyone who has information in relation to this horrific crime to provide it to the Police Service of Northern Ireland."" The RUC became the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in 2001.

563,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Help trickled in Thursday to remote islands where whole villages were flattened by a earthquake and tsunami in western Indonesia. At least 343 people died and another 340 were missing after the magnitude 7.7 earthquake Monday, according to Indonesia's National Disaster Agency. Meanwhile, nature continued to shows its force, with hot clouds and ash spewing from a Java volcano that erupted and killed more than 30 residents. A magnitude 5.3 earthquake rumbled in Maluku province to the east. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage there. The delivery of aid to the devastated islands near Sumatra is a logistics challenge. An assessment team from the nonprofit group SurfAid International began surveying villages on the islands of North Pagai and South Pagai, the group said Thursday. The nonprofit is one of the few to have reached the remote disaster zone. The trip takes at least 10 hours in good conditions, according to aid agencies. The hard-hit Mentawai Islands region is among Indonesia's myriad islands. ""The village of Sabeugungung has been completely wiped out, with 50 dead and 150 missing presumed dead. Sikakap hospital is overflowing with over 200 people seeking assistance,"" SurfAid said in a blog post. Ten villagers in Bosua had been killed, another was missing, and 78 houses had been destroyed, the nonprofit said. Late Wednesday, SurfAid sent 1,000 shelter kits, 500 building kits and 500 hygiene kits to victims by charter boat. Another charter boat had delivered an initial batch of supplies, including blankets, tarps and water containers, and more aid shipments were planned, SurfAid said. The group was trying to work with government officials to establish an information and coordination hub for all non-governmental organizations, spokeswoman Jossi Syahrial said. The Indonesian Red Cross also had sent at least two aid teams to the disaster zone. One aid shipment included about 400 body bags. Urgent needs are expected to include clean water, food, blankets, clothing, medical attention, emergency shelter and hygiene kits, said Ita Balanda, a program manager for the World Vision aid organization in Padang, Indonesia. An estimated 7,900 households were affected, she said. ""The worst hit area is North and South Pagai Island. Reports of villages flattened are coming from there,"" said Antorizon of the West Sumatra disaster management agency, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. The first pictures from North Pagai Island showed damaged and flattened structures. Monday's quake generated a ""significant"" tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. Some of the missing might include people who are unaccounted for after fleeing to higher ground, said Henri Dori Satoko, head of the Mentawai Islands parliament. Though communication poses a challenge in the remote area, some witnesses in West Sumatra reported seeing a wave 6 meters (nearly 20 feet) high. Other reports described the tsunami as being about 3 meters (almost 10 feet) high. At least one village with a population of about 200 people was swept away, with only 40 people recovered, Satoko said. Indonesia's government has since warned residents of West Sumatra province to stay alert and stay away from the coastline for up to five days because of the possibility of more earthquakes, Balanda said. The city of Padang and the Mentawai Islands are at the meeting place of two tectonic plates, making them vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off northern Sumatra. A tsunami generated by that earthquake killed more than 225,000 people in 14 countries -- mainly India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The Indonesian region of Banda Aceh was hard-hit: About 150,000 died there. To the east, on Java, the death toll from Tuesday's eruption of Mount Merapi has climbed to 32, medical officials said Thursday. Merapi, which looms on the horizon north of the major city of Yogyakarta, is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and lies in one of the world's most densely populated areas. The volcano has a summit elevation of nearly 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Hundreds of displaced residents have crammed a small government building in Yogyakarta. Many had fled with only the clothes on their backs. Some refused to flee, holding out to watch over their crops and livestock. Some residents awaited word from the traditional gatekeeper of Mount Merapi. But Maradjin, the gatekeeper, fell victim to the volcano as well. He was to be buried Thursday. He died in his 80s, after being appointed about two decades ago by the last Sultan of Java. Maradjin's father was gatekeeper before him. ""Merapi is a house of spirits, which also means a living mountain,"" Maradjin told CNN in a 2006 interview. ""When Merapi emits smoke, we have to be respectful."" CNN's Kathy Quiano, Paula Hancocks and Stan Grant contributed to this report.","Death toll from earthquake and tsunami rises to 343 .

564,"Washington (CNN) -- The United States is contributing an estimated $4.5 million worth of firefighting equipment and other supplies to help battle massive wildfires in Russia, according to the Obama administration. President Barack Obama called Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday to express his ""deepest condolences"" for Russian losses in the fires, which have killed hundreds of people this summer, the White House noted. ""The president told President Medvedev that he is monitoring the situation closely, and that the United States is responding to Russia's request for technical assistance in combating the fires,"" the White House said. U.S. deliveries include ""water tanks, pumps, hand tools, fire-protective clothing, and medical kits,"" a State Department release said Friday. The United States also donated $50,000 to support Red Cross and Red Crescent efforts ""to provide relief items, including blankets, bedding, and food parcels, for victims."" We stand ""with the people of Russia as they fight to contain the destructive spread of wildfires,"" State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said. ""We are taking action to support the heroic efforts of Russian firefighters and emergency responders as they seek to bring these fires under control.""

565,"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- An official with the Indian lawn bowls team has been diagnosed with dengue fever but is in stable condition, doctors confirmed Monday. Ruptu Gogoi was hospitalized on Friday, according to doctors, who suspect the 30-year-old male patient could have contracted the mosquito-borne viral disease from outside the Commonwealth Games athletes' village in New Delhi. Gogoi had complained of feeling sick a day after he arrived at the athletes village last month, said Rajiv Sagar, a spokesman for the G.B. Pant Hospital in the city. Doctors, therefore, think he may have acquired the  mosquito-borne viral disease from outside the facility, Sagar said. Dengue is the most common virus transmitted by mosquitoes in the world. It causes as many as 100 million infections and kills 25,000 people every year. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas, according to the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, after harsh criticism and controversy, the 2010 Commonwealth Games began Sunday with a lavish opening ceremony. Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium gleamed with multi-colored lights as representatives from Commonwealth countries walked the length of the field by turns, waving their flags and wearing traditional native costumes. It's the first time India has hosted the international sporting event between countries of the former British Empire. The games, held every four years, include many Olympic events as well as other sports played traditionally in those countries. Among the competitions is lawn bowling, where the object is to get more of one team's ball closer to a small white ball, or jack, than the opponent. Britain's Prince Charles and Indian President Pratibha Devisingh Patil officially declared the games open. Prince Charles was representing his mother, Queen Elizabeth. The games have been a tough act for a nation that has never hosted such a large international event. Parliament has been forced to deal with accusations of corruption in the planning of the games. Two weeks ago, gunmen fired on a tourist bus in New Delhi and injured two Taiwanese tourists. A car blaze turned out to be a crudely manufactured bomb. And a militant group warned that it planned to target the games. Indian law enforcement authorities responded with a heightened security plan, placing thousands of extra forces on the streets of the capital. If all that weren't enough, two days before athletes were scheduled to begin arriving, complaints rang out across the globe about their shoddy living quarters. ""You know, construction dust is still there, filth, excrement, it really is disgusting in parts and it really requires a professional deep clean throughout the entire complex,"" said Michael Hooper, chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Games Federation. As if to amplify Hooper's complaint, a pedestrian bridge leading to Nehru stadium collapsed that same day. Two world-class athletes canceled their trips, citing security and health concerns. Entire teams threatened to do the same, while others delayed their arrival date. Indian officials went to work on a massive clean-up effort. In the end, athletes from 71 countries showed up. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Doctors think Gogoi may have contracted the disease outside the athletes' village .

566,"(CNN) -- Cattle carcasses dot the desert. More beggars show up at street corners in the capital, Niamey. These are indications that Niger is on the brink of catastrophe, say aid workers. But few outside the country have noticed these signs in one of the world's least developed nations. And now an encroaching emergency caused by months of severe drought is threatening to leave 8 million people, or half the nation's population, hungry. The United Nations' World Food Programme announced Tuesday that it is ""massively scaling up"" food distribution to people who have lost crops and livestock. In this nomadic, pastoral nation, they are people who have lost everything. ""The drought in Niger is an unfolding catastrophe for millions of people and we are struggling against time to scale up quickly enough to reach the escalating number of hungry,"" said Josette Sheeran, executive director for the U.N. agency. Sheeran traveled to Niger to see the crisis for herself and saw a landlocked, drought-prone nation where hunger has been growing steadily since the last harvest in September 2009. ""We are massively scaling up special nutritional help for children under two years of age, whose brains and bodies face permanent damage from acute malnutrition,"" said Sheeran in a statement released Tuesday after her visit. The agency said it aims to feed about 8 million people through the end of the year by distributing food rations that include a corn and soy supplement, a peanut paste and vitamin-fortified sugar and milk for children. Earlier this month, 10 leading international aid agencies had called for a surge in the humanitarian response to the hunger crisis across the Sahel region of west and central Africa -- 2 million more people are threatened in Chad and thousands others in Mali, Mauritania, parts of Burkina Faso and northern Nigeria. But Niger is at the heart. And despite months of warnings, the money for emergency aid has been what aid agencies described as paltry. The United Nations needs another $229 million to reach its recently revised target aid amount of $371 million. The World Food Programme's appeal follows a similar call by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which earlier this month increased the aid requirement for Niger to $253 million from $191 million. The food agency said it only has half the $213 million it needs to expand its feeding operation. ""I think it has been a really slow onset emergency,"" said Johannes Schoors, chief of missions in Niger for the aid agency CARE International. ""We got very little response from donors."" That's partly because Niger's has been an invisible problem so far. There are not yet thousands of people starving. Nor are there images of distended bellies and bones piercing out of flesh, as there were in the Sudan famine in the 1990s. The markets still carry fresh fruit for those who can travel far and have deep pockets. But, Schoors said, if things are allowed to go on this way, human suffering will become unbearable. Schoors' colleague Stephane Petitprez, CARE's emergency director who just returned from 10 days in eastern Niger, said the people of Niger have no way to survive without their livestock. Their future is dying with the animals. ""They have to start a new life,"" she said. But without rain, it will be difficult.","Half of Niger's population is threatened by a food shortage caused by prolonged drought .

567,"(CNN) -- A flu shot can do more than just fight against influenza, a new study suggests. It may also fight against heart attacks. Adults who take the flu vaccine may be less likely to get their first heart attack the next year, researchers say. The study, published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, was conducted to add to other studies that suggested that there is a link between respiratory infections and heart attacks. ""By the nature of the study, it does not prove cause and effect. So it does not prove that the flu vaccine prevents heart attacks. But it does show that the flu vaccine is associated with the reduction,"" said Niro Siriwardena, one of the authors of the study and a professor at the University of Lincoln in England. British researchers, who conducted the study, compared the medical records of a little more than 16,000 first-time heart attack victims age 40 and older with the records of nearly 62,700 people who had not had heart attacks. After factoring other major risks for heart attacks, such as smoking and family history of heart ailments, the research found that the flu shot was associated to a 19 percent reduction in the rate of first heart attack, the study found. And the benefit was even more for those that received flu shots earlier in the flu season. Those who got the shots early had a 21 percent reduction in the rate of heart attacks in the next year, the study found.","NEW: Study does not prove cause and effect, researcher says .

568,"San Bruno, California (CNN) -- California Sen. Barbara Boxer demanded answers Saturday to questions about why a gas transmission line ruptured in a suburban San Francisco town, triggering a massive fire that killed four people and left five people missing. Accompanied by state and federal officials, Boxer toured blocks of the charred neighborhood in San Bruno that now looks like a war zone. The Democratic senator saw firsthand the intensely hot fire's wrath: melted cars, burned out skeletons of houses. At a news conference later, she said it was hard to put into words how a beautiful neighborhood almost disappeared. ""Many questions must be answered by all of us whose job it is to protect our people,"" Boxer said. ""What was the cause of this blast of course, first and foremost?"" she asked. ""Were there reports that there were odors escaping from the pipeline? If there were those reports, what actions took place in response to those complaints? Were emergency systems such as water supply up to the task? Was the gas flow shut down as quickly as possible? Does danger lie in similar pipelines in populated areas?"" Lt. Gov Abel Maldonado said he has written a letter to the California Public Utilities Commission, seeking information on gas pipelines across the state, including their age, inspection dates and records. New remains were found in the debris left by the large fire, Steve Firpo, a city spokesman, said on Saturday, though he could not immediately confirm whether they were human. He had initially told CNN two more bodies were found. San Bruno Police Chief Neil Telford said five people were still missing. Residents packed a town hall meeting later Saturday, seeking answers from public officials about when they can go home and other rebuilding and compensation issues. Pacific Gas and Electric President Chris Johns said the company has been scouring phone records and so far, there is no evidence that complaint calls were placed. Nor was there evidence, he said, that utility crews had been in the area Thursday, the day of the blast. Firefighters were able to fully contain the blaze Friday, but federal and state investigators had not yet determined the cause. ""We are not hear to determine liability or blame, but we are here to determine the cause of the accident,"" National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Vice Chairman Christopher Hart said. Hart said the 30-inch natural gas pipe was installed in 1956. ""We have seen that piece of pipeline that was blown away, and it is really quite amazing to see this huge piece of pipeline blown the distance it was blown,"" he said. Hart said investigators will look closely at the pipe's welding and whether the pipe properly emitted an odor that may indicate a gas leak. There have been allegations of a smell in the neighborhood at least a week before the blast. Officials have identified three of the dead. Rescue workers initially feared the death toll would climb higher as they combed through the smoldering scene with cadaver dogs. Jacqueline Greig, 44, and her 13-year-old daughter Janessa were killed, San Mateo County Deputy Coroner Michelle Rippy said. A third victim was identified as Jessica Morales, 20. Another 52 people were injured, including three patients who were taken to the hospital with third-degree burns and four firefighters who suffered from smoke inhalation. Boxer assured those affected by the fire that state and federal authorities would do all they could in ensuring recovery. ""We must leave no stone unturned,"" she said about getting assistance to the devastated community. Some residents remained in shelters and watched the harrowing drama unfold on television in a Starbucks or other restaurants at the Bayhill Shopping Center. Patty Blick did not know whether to laugh or cry. Anger, she told CNN iReporter Brad Bailey, has not yet set in, even though she watched her entire block burn to the ground and her home of seven years vanish into ashes. Blick was still worrying about some of her neighbors. She didn't know whether they were lying in a hospital or whether they had escaped unscathed. Outside in the parking lot, food and other donated items piled up as San Bruno residents chipped in to help their neighbors. One person even left a baby stroller. The NTSB investigation will include analyzing many aspects of the blast and its aftermath, Hart said, including the history of the pipeline, the training and performance of its operators, emergency response and injuries sustained. Employees involved in operating the pipeline have been tested for drugs and alcohol, he said. The fire destroyed 37 homes and damaged eight, California Emergency Management Agency Secretary Matthew Bettenhausen said. Those numbers were considerably lower than the estimate of roughly 170 homes that NTSB's Hart originally said were affected by the blaze. Companies operating natural gas transmission pipelines reported an average of one death per year from 2004 to 2008, a February report from the Congressional Research Service. Carl Weimer, head of the watchdog group Pipeline Safety Trust, told CNN that, unfortunately, when it comes to pipelines, for most of the public it's ""out of sight, out of mind."" ""I'm betting in San Bruno most people didn't even know the pipeline was under their neighborhood,"" he said. Weimer noted that there can be multiple causes for a pipeline failure, including unintentional excavation-related damage and, more often, age and corrosion.

569,"(CNN) -- A mechanical problem forced NASA to delay the final launch of the Space shuttle Discovery at least until next Tuesday, the space agency said Friday. Engineers found an air leak in the right hand Orbital Maneuvering System Pod, which they say will take a day to repair. Launchtime on Tuesday is set for 4:12 p.m., when weather experts predict a 70 percent chance of acceptable weather, NASA said. The Discovery's 11-day flight, which had been set to launch on Monday, will be a ""very busy mission,"" according to NASA Flight Director Bryan Lunney. ""After we fly around the Earth about 170 times, Discovery will come home for its last flight,"" Lunney said during a news conference last month. ""The crew is ready to go."" The six-member crew, led by Cmdr. Steven Lindsey, will install a new ""permanent multipurpose module"" called Leonardo on the International Space Station. This will be the 133rd space shuttle mission and the final one for Discovery. The shuttle Endeavour is set to launch February 26, and Congress passed a bill this month authorizing another, final space shuttle mission.","NEW: Weather experts predict 70 percent chance of good launch weather .

570,"Zhouqu, China(CNN) -- A day after a miraculous rescue, the sounds of cheers were replaced by crying families, the roar of bulldozers and dynamite blasting debris in Zhouqu, China, on Wednesday. More than 24 hours after a man was pulled from the debris of his collapsed home, the grim reality is setting in that the death toll in the region is rising rapidly. Recovery teams pulled another dead body from one destroyed building. Another group carried what appeared to be the remains of a young child through the streets. The bodies are delivered to a makeshift morgue just outside the city. The roads in are also jammed with trucks carrying hundreds of coffins, along with the much needed supplies of water, food and medicine. The official death toll stands at 702, with more than a thousand still reported missing after mudslides and flooding engulfed this ethnic-Tibetan city in northwest China Saturday night. One village of 300 houses that local people said was home to more than 2,000 people was completely wiped out. The mud is becoming a threat to rescue teams as well. Pockets of air remain just below the surface, threatening to swallow up anyone who steps through them. The heat also hampered the rescue efforts, compounded by a severe lack of drinking water and the growing threat of disease. Temperatures on the ground are hovering around 34-degrees Celsius (93-degrees Fahrenheit). Teams of workers combed through the city spraying for insecticide and disinfectants. With so many dead bodies still believed to be decomposing in the heat and mud, fears of epidemic were on the rise. State media reported that 7,000 tents were delivered to the city to help house the displaced. But a lack of flat and stable ground to pitch camps meant that most survivors faced the prospect of another day without shelter, while digging through debris in search of loved ones. China's rainy season started with a vengeance in early May and has brought the worst flooding in a decade. More rain is forecast in the next few days. Some of the rocks and debris from the mudslide landed in the middle of the Bailong River that snakes through the area. The river overflowed and inundated low-lying neighborhoods. The government has been using explosives to break up the river debris, in an attempt to gradually release the water safely. CNN's Emily Chang in Zhouqu, China, and Brian Walker in Atlanta contributed to this report.","The death toll stands at 702 .

571,"(CNN) -- At least two carriages of a passenger train fell into a river Thursday after floods destroyed a bridge in southwest China's Sichuan Province, state-run CCTV reported Friday, citing Chengdu Railway authorities. It was not immediately known how many passengers were inside the carriages, which a firefighter said were swept 200 meters downriver. Local authorities said they were doing their best to carry out rescues. The accident occurred in Guanghan at about 3:20 p.m. Thursday on the Shi-ting-jiang Bridge, part of the railway line that links Chengdu and Baoji, in northwestern Shaanxi Province. Floods caused the bridge piers to collapse, which forced the train from its track, they said. People aboard five other carriages were taken to safety.

572,"(CNN) -- The salmonella outbreak that led to the recall of 380 million eggs was preventable and will likely grow, federal officials said Thursday. Hundreds of Americans likely have become ill from tainted eggs in recent months, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said Thursday. From May 1 to July 31, a total of 1,953 cases of Salmonella enteritidis were reported; the expected number of such cases ordinarlily in that time would be about 700, Dr. Christopher Braden, acting director of the CDC's division of food-borne, waterborne and environmental diseases, said in a conference call Thursday. The CDC is not yet sure exactly how many cases can be attributed to this particular outbreak. The salmonella outbreak prompted Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, to increase its recall Wednesday to 380 million eggs. The number of salmonella cases is expected to grow because any that occurred after July 17 may not yet be reported due to a two- to three-week lag between when a person becomes sick and when the case gets reported in the system, the CDC said. ""We would certainly characterize this as one of the largest shell egg recalls in recent history,"" Sherri McGarry of the Food and Drug Administration said in a conference call Thursday. On July 9, the FDA announced it had new safety rules for large-scale egg producers, but that came after the salmonella outbreak apparently began. ""The outbreak could have been prevented."" McGarry said. ""The egg safety rule is in a phase-in approach, but there are measures that would have been in place that could have prevented this if it been placed earlier than in July."" FDA's new rules cover refrigeration of stored and transported eggs, pasteurization, rodent control, cleanliness and a required written Salmonella enteritidis prevention plan. The agency said ""implementing the preventive measures would reduce the number of Salmonella Enteritidis infections from eggs by nearly 60 percent."" Producers with more than 50,000 laying hens, or about 80 percent of the market, were to comply by now. The regulations requires ""egg producers with fewer than 50,000 but at least 3,000 laying hens whose shell eggs are not processed with a treatment, such as pasteurization, to comply with the regulation by July 9, 2012."" The Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group, said the FDA needs a strong inspection force. Health departments across the country are tracking cases of salmonella and dispensing advice to citizens. Arizona, for example, has seen a twofold increase in salmonella reports, with an uptick beginning in June, said Dr. Joli Weiss, food-borne disease epidemiologist for the state Department of Health Services. Thoroughly cooking eggs kills salmonella bacteria within, but there is still risk of cross-contamination if a food preparer doesn't properly wash kitchen utensils, such as whisks or spatulas, that came into contact with the raw eggs. Undercooked food also leaves the consumer at risk of infection. Salmonella, which is generally contracted from contaminated poultry, meat, eggs, or water, affects the intestinal tract. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps, which typically begin within 12 to 72 hours, according to the CDC. Vomiting, chills, headache and muscle pains also may occur, according to the Mayo Clinic. These symptoms last about four to seven days, and then go away without specific treatment in healthy people. Antidiarrheal medications may help with cramps, but they may also prolong the diarrhea, the Mayo Clinic said. The elderly, infants, and people with impaired immune systems are at heightened risk for developing a more serious illness because of salmonella, the CDC said. Some people can develop life-threatening complications if the infection spreads beyond the intestines. Chickens can pass the bacteria to eggs because the eggs leave hens through the same passageway as feces, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service. Alternatively, bacteria in the hen's ovary or oviduct can get to the egg before the shell forms around it, FSIS said. Wright County Egg added several more batches and brands to the recall Wednesday afternoon. ""Wright County Egg is fully cooperating with FDA's investigation by undertaking this voluntary recall,"" the company said in a statement. ""Our primary concern is keeping salmonella out of the food supply and away from consumers. As a precautionary measure, Wright County Egg also has decided to divert its existing inventory of shell eggs from the recalled plants to a breaker, where they will be pasteurized to kill any salmonella bacteria present."" After the uptick in salmonella infections, the CDC and the FDA traced the source and determined it was most likely eggs from Wright County Egg. The company says it is working to determine how the shell eggs are being contaminated. The CDC reported Thursday evening that more than one person became ill in 26 restaurants in 10 states. Information showed that Wright County Egg was an egg supplier to 15 of the restaurants. Krista Eberle, director of food safety programs at the Egg Safety Center, reiterated that only shell eggs are affected by the Wright County recall. ""From what we know they only do shell eggs, and if they did extra egg products, they are still considered to be safe,"" Eberle said. She added that egg products such as egg whites and dried eggs go through pasteurization and extensive heat treatment, so they're considered safe to eat and the Egg Safety Center is not concerned the other products might be sullied with bacteria. Country Eggs, Inc. on Thursday said it is voluntary recalling specific Julian dates of shell eggs produced by Wright County Egg. Eggs were distributed to food wholesalers, distribution centers and food-service companies in California, Arizona and Nevada, according to a statement. Eggs were packaged under the Country Eggs, Inc. brand name in 15 dozen bulk pack with the identifying plant code of P 1946 and P 1026. Julian code dates are 216-221. Dates and codes can be found on the box label. Wednesday's recall covers eggs branded as Albertsons, Farm Fresh, James Farms, Glenview, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma, Lund, Kemps and Pacific Coast and are marked with a three-digit code ranging from 136 to 229 and plant numbers1720 and 1942, the company said. In addition, NuCal Foods, which, on its website, calls itself the largest distributor of shell eggs in the western United States, announced Thursday it was ""voluntarily recalling specific ... dates of shell eggs produced by Wright County Egg and packaged by NuCal Foods because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella."" The earlier recall covered the Lucerne, Albertson, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma, Sunshine, Hillandale, Trafficanda, Farm Fresh, Shoreland, Lund, Dutch Farms and Kemps brands that were marked with with a three-digit code ranging from 136 to 225 and plant numbers 1026, 1413 and 1946. The four-digit plant number begins with ""P - "" and is followed by the three-digit code. Both recalls affect eggs packed in several different sized cartons, from a half-dozen to 18 eggs. Only shell eggs are affected by the recall, the company said. Consumers are encouraged to return the eggs in their original packaging to where they were purchased for a full refund. Eggs have not been a major source of infection in humans for this particular strain of salmonella, enteritidis, in the last twoor three years, said Patrick McDonough at Cornell University's School of Veterinary Medicine. A big outbreak like this one is out of the norm, he said. Ideally, when a chick becomes a candidate to become an egg-laying hen, it is put in a clean environment with clean water and feed, he said. But that is not always the case, he said. Rodents can get in the feed, and their feces can transmit bacteria to the birds. One Wisconsin woman infected by salmonella has filed a lawsuit against a restaurant that allegedly served contaminated eggs linked to the nationwide outbreak of the potentially deadly bacteria. Plaintiff Tanja Dzinovic, 27, from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said she got sick after eating at the Baker Street Restaurant and Pub in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in June. She recently retained the Seattle, Washington-based law firm Marler Clark, which specializes in food poisoning cases, and amended her lawsuit against the restaurant to include Wright County Egg. Drew Falkenstein, the Marler Clark attorney co-representing Dzinovic, said Thursday although she returned to work a while ago, after a week of acute illness, she suffers from ongoing gastrointestinal problems. In the legal complaint, Marler Clark says, ""defendant Baker Street Restaurant and Pub purchased and used in the manufacture of its menu items Salmonella-contaminated shell eggs subject to defendant Wright County Egg's August 16, 2010 recall."" The Kenosha County Health Department closed the restaurant on July 13 to investigate an outbreak of ""at least 30 confirmed Salmonella enteritidis illnesses... including the plaintiff's,"" according to the complaint. The restaurant has since reopened. Falkenstein said even though Wright County has recalled the eggs, Baker Street Restaurant will remain part of the lawsuit. He said when so many people in one restaurant became ill that it should have raised red flags and called the food-handling practices into question. The 30 cases of salmonella reported in Kenosha County came from no specific source and not all the people were connected to the restaurant, said Diane Bosovich, assistant director of nursing for the health department. She wasn't certain how many may have been tied to the restaurant, which she said was closed for a week as ""a precaution."" She indicated that Baker Street Restaurant has been inspected and employees were educated on proper food handling. There were no findings of food-borne sources of salmonella, but she couldn't comment on whether any employees tested positive for the disease at the time. L & K Tricoli, LLC, which owns the Baker Street Restaurant and Pub and two other Kenosha restaurants, did not respond to repeated CNN requests for comment.

573,"(CNN) -- The DUI manslaughter trial of former New York Yankees player Jim Leyritz is set to begin Monday in Broward County Circuit Court in Florida. Leyritz is charged with driving while intoxicated and causing a crash that killed 30-year-old Fredia Veitch on December 28, 2007. The fatal crash happened shortly after 3 a.m. at an intersection controlled by traffic lights. Leyritz, a hero of the 1996 World Series, had turned 44 the previous day and had spent the evening celebrating at bars in Fort Lauderdale. Attorneys in the case expect witnesses to disagree about whether Leyritz had a yellow or red light as he entered the intersection of S.W. 7th Avenue and S.W. 2nd Street. The front of Leyritz's Ford Expedition hit the driver's side of Veitch's Mitsubishi Montero, causing the car  to spin and roll. Veitch, who lived in Plantation, was thrown from the car and died from her injuries. Leyritz stayed at the scene, where police administered and videotaped field sobriety tests. Police allege the former ballplayer failed the tests; his defense maintains Leyritz was not impaired at the time. More than three hours after the crash, Leyritz's blood was drawn at Broward General Hospital. His blood alcohol level was .14; the legal limit in Florida is .08. Both sides agree that Veitch was intoxicated at the time of the crash. Her blood alcohol was .18 and she was not wearing a seat belt. The defense also says that Veitch was driving without headlights and receiving calls and text messages on her cell phone around the time of the crash. A judge ruled last month that Veitch's conduct and state of mind are not relevant to the issue of whether she had a red or green light. Leyritz's attorney is barred from telling the jury that Veitch was intoxicated, that she did not wear her seat belt and that she may have been distracted by calls and texts on her cell phone. Leyritz maintains that he entered the intersection when his traffic light was yellow and that Veitch caused the crash by running a red light. Under Florida law, if Leyritz caused or contributed to the accident, he can be found guilty of DUI manslaughter, even if jurors believe Veitch shares the blame. He pleaded not guilty and if convicted, the former New York Yankee faces a minimum of four to 15 years in state prison. Leyritz settled a wrongful death case earlier this year, agreeing to pay an initial lump sum of $250,000. He also agreed to pay $1,000 a month for 100 months starting on April 15, 2011. The money is to be paid to Veitch's husband and two children. Leyritz played for the New York Yankees from 1990 to 1996 and returned for parts of the 1999 and 2000 seasons. He is best known for a three-run home run in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series against the Atlanta Braves, which turned the series around for the Yankees. Leyritz also played for the Anaheim Angels, Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox, San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers. He was mainly a catcher throughout his career. He retired from professional baseball in 2000. Now divorced, Leyritz lives in Florida, where he is raising his three sons.","Former Yankees player Jim Leyritz goes on trial in a fatal 2007 DUI crash .

574,"Shanksville, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Laura Bush on Saturday led the commemoration for the victims of Flight 93, which crashed and burned as passengers and crew fought hijackers determined to strike the U.S. Capitol on September 11, 2001. Standing on a windswept outlook at the site of the future Flight 93 national memorial, the first ladies remembered the 40 people who took off from Newark International Airport in New Jersey nine years ago, and found themselves in combat with four al Qaeda terrorists. ""I come here as an American, filled with a sense of awe at the heroism of my fellow citizens. I come as a wife, a daughter, and a sister, heartbroken at the loss so many of you have endured,"" Obama said to survivors and family members of those who died. They were part of a throng of dignitaries and locals who came to the annual event. Obama said the people on the plane were from different backgrounds and walks of life. ""They all took a different path to that September morning. But in the awful moment when the facts became clear and they were called to make an impossible choice, they all found the same resolve. They agreed to the same bold plan,"" she said, referring to their decision to attack the hijackers. ""They rose as one. They acted as one. Together, they changed history's course. In the days that followed, when we learned about the heroes of Flight 93,"" we were ""proud,"" ""awed"" and ""inspired"" but not surprised because the people on the plane had provided service and sacrificed much in their daily lives, she said. Obama and Bush praised each other in their words. Obama thanked her predecessor for helping the nation heal after the attack, and Bush praised her successor, saying she was pleased ""to be here with the first lady who serves this country with such grace."" Bush noted that the terrorists who hijacked the plane had other targets in mind, but the spot near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, ""was chosen by the passengers of Flight 93, who spared our country from even greater horrors."" ""As we gather to remember those who were lost and honor their courage, we are deeply grateful,"" she said. Speaking generally about 9/11, Bush praised the first responders in Shanksville, the rescuers at the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon, and the millions who took part in blood drives, vigils and memorial services. In the wake of the attacks, Americans said prayers in Hebrew, English, and Arabic, and ""we found unity in shared grief."" Speaking about those who lost loved ones and still feel the wounds of loss, she said ""we know the memories of your loved ones have not aged by time."" ""You inspire us with your grace and strength,"" she said. She also praised those ""who oppose radicalism and terrorism at this very hour in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places around the world. On this day, Americans have no division."" Others who spoke at the ceremony were Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, and Gordon Felt, president of Families of Flight 93. As each name of the 40 victims were read, a bell was rung. A chorus and a string quartet performed and clergymen spoke and prayed.","First ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush remember the passengers' bravery .

576,"(CNN) -- The crew of a tour boat that sank in a collision in the Delaware River last week made radio calls to a vessel involved in the crash, but those calls went unanswered, federal investigators said Monday. The tour boat crew told investigators that they made radio calls to the vessel Caribbean Sea that were not answered, the National Transportation Safety Board said. The Caribbean Sea was towing a barge that collided with the tour boat, causing it to sink in 55 feet of water, the report said. Two people died. One of five crew members of the Caribbean Sea, meanwhile, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to meet with investigators, the safety board said. ""We remain confident the NTSB will shed light on all of the facts surrounding this accident. Our mutual goal is to ensure nothing like this ever happens again,"" said Chris Herschend, president of Ride The Ducks. Since RTD Philadelphia began in 2003, there has never been a serious accident and only a handful of mechanical breakdowns, company officials said. The tour boat, the DUKW 34, carried 35 passengers and two crew members when it experienced mechanical problems about five to 10 minutes before the crash, the NTSB report said. That problem led the ship's master to anchor the tour boat. Meanwhile, the Caribbean Sea approached, towing a barge. Around 2:36 p.m., the bow of the barge hit the small tour boat, causing it to sink, investigators said. People who operated several vessels in the area have told federal investigators that they heard the tour boat's radio calls. The National Traffic Safety Board said it's looking into those accounts. The agency noted that some -- but not all -- such radio calls are recorded. Two people died as a result of the collision -- Szabolcs Prem, 20, and Dora Schwendtner, 16. Both were from Hungary.","Crew of tour boat said it made radio calls before collision .

577,"(CNN) -- Just about everyone who worked to build the new Interstate Highway 35W bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, knew that their project would never be ""just a bridge.""  It would never occupy the same category as thousands of other concrete and steel behemoths that millions of American drivers thoughtlessly cross every day. On August 1, 2007, the deaths of 13 people and the injuries of 145 others made sure of that. On that Wednesday evening, unforgettable live video showed cars and trucks tossed into the Mississippi River like toys amid the massive wreckage of the original I-35W bridge, which had somehow collapsed while thousands commuted home from work. Three years later, family transformed by bridge disaster  The tragedy left Americans wondering about the safety of bridges and tunnels in their hometowns. Later, the tragedy threw a world of attention on the new bridge that would be built in its place. The new bridge, completed in September 2008, is expected to stand for 100 years. ""That's got to be the safest bridge in America, right?"" joked a Minneapolis resident this week. Alan Phipps, leader of the team that designed the new bridge, chuckles when he hears those kinds of comments. ""I'd say there's a lot of truth to that,"" he said during a phone conversation this week at his Florida office at FIGG Engineering Group.  Builders and designers completed the 10-lane Interstate bridge three months ahead of schedule at a price of $233.8 million. ""It was pretty amazing,"" said Phipps of the marathon project. ""I paid for it with a lot of my hair and so did a lot of other people.""  Although stylish curved piers and a bright white color mark a visual departure from its predecessor, it's what's baked into the bridge that makes it truly unusual. Three-hundred-twenty-three high-technology sensors dot the structure, spitting out a constant stream of data regularly analyzed by engineers at nearby University of Minnesota.   At a total cost of about $1 million including wire connections and power sources, the sensors don't eliminate the need for visual inspections, but they do provide an extra layer of maintenance security.   The sensors monitor corrosion, stress and the movement of the bridge from the constant traffic. ""The fiber-optic strain gauge technology is fairly cutting edge,"" said Phipps. ""A tiny beam of light is used to measure very small differences in the movement of the bridge when vehicles pass over."" Sorry, no flashing red lights or alarms go off when the sensors register something unusual, Phipps said, chuckling. If the fiber-optic sensors show changes in the bridge's movement, data analysts would order a visual inspection, said Phipps, perhaps heading off structural damage that might pose a threat to the people crossing overhead. Less sophisticated strain gauges made of eight-inch pieces of wire measure more specific changes in the bridge's movements. ""It's like going to the doctor's office and having tests done. If something comes up different, then the doctor takes a closer look."" The sensors are wired to a power source and data flows through wires to a nearby computer. The computer is hooked up to fiber-optic cables leading to DOT and University of Minnesota networks. The analytical data can be remotely accessed online on an interface that displays it in tables of numbers, charts and graphs. Another sensor embedded in the bridge looks like a big fork, said Phipps. This one constantly monitors for possible corrosion. Each prong in the fork is embedded at a different depth in the concrete. A power source sends electricity through the sensor. The amount of electricity passing through the sensor indicates the potential for corrosion on the bridge.  Security sensors also have been built into the new bridge to guard against terrorist attacks. Infrared cameras and other technology monitor for unauthorized activity in sensitive areas of the structure, including doors to equipment chambers. National horror stemming from the collapse prompted the U.S. transportation secretary to urge all states to immediately inspect about 750 bridges of the same design nationwide. By law, states must inspect bridges like the one on I-35W every two years. A yearlong investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board blamed the bridge collapse on support plates that were too thin and increased weight on the bridge due to construction equipment. The NTSB recommended nine improvements to state and federal highway officials regarding inspections and how bridge designs are reviewed. If sensors had been installed on the old bridge, would they have provided enough warning to prevent disaster? ""Maybe, maybe not,"" said Phipps. ""This sensor system was designed expressly for this type of bridge. The old bridge would have used a different kind of system, so it's hard to say."" Sensors allow an added layer of security to regularly scheduled visual inspections. ""If the sensor gives off a reading that's ""really crazy, then you could go out to the bridge that day and take a look."" But each bridge owner must weigh the costs and benefits of including high-tech sensor arrays. At about $1 million for the new I-35W's sensors, that's a pretty big decision. A new bridge, said Phipps, is unlikely to fail, because quality control measures are included in construction.   Planners considering expensive sensors may choose to spend the money instead on repairing or maintaining an older bridge so it will last longer. ""The bridges you worry about are the older ones,"" he said.  About 25 percent of all 603,245 U.S. public road bridges are classified as deficient, according to a report announced this month by the Federal Highway Administration.  An immediate ""cost-benefitial"" investment aimed at replacing or repairing deficient bridges might cost nearly $99 billion, according to the Department of Transportation.","3 years after Minneapolis bridge collapse, replacement bridge boasts high-tech safety .

578,"Washington (CNN) -- Several shots have been fired at the National Museum of the Marine Corps building in Virginia, the FBI said Friday. No injuries were reported. It is the second time the Marine Corps museum in Triangle, Virginia, has been fired on in recent days. The Pentagon and a vacant Marine Corps Recruiting Station in Virginia also were shot at recently. All the previous shots came from the same weapon, authorities said. Federal officials said they believe that the person taking the late-night shots at military-related buildings has a grievance against the institution of the Marine Corps but not the men and women serving in the Marines. The officials said at a news conference that they want to talk with the shooter. ""We'd like to know what this grievance is and what we can do to try to resolve it,"" said John Perren, assistant director of the FBI's Washington field office. The latest incident occurred Thursday night, said Gwen Adams, spokeswoman at the National Museum of the Marine Corps. No one was in the building at the time, she said. New bullet holes were found in the glass and metal structure of the building but not inside, Adams said. The new damage was found during a routine inspection, officials said. The bullet holes were on the western side of the building, which faces Interstate 95, the FBI said. The shots probably came from the interstate, said Maj. Mike Crosbie of the Prince William County, Virginia, police department. The museum was closed Friday morning while the investigation continued, Adams said. It will remain closed for the rest of the day, she said. There were no plans Friday to cancel or postpone Sunday's Marine Corps Marathon or any events connected with it, race spokeswoman Tami Faram said. Additional security measures have been taken, however, to bolster an ""already robust plan"" for security at the marathon, Col. Daniel J. Choike, the commander of Marine Corps Base Quantico, said Friday.","NEW: The FBI says the shooter probably has grievance against the Marine Corps .

580,"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- The 33 workers trapped in a Chilean mine got a rare treat Tuesday night:  they got to watch their national soccer team compete against Ukraine via a small projector wired down to their safety chamber on a fiber optic cable. Chile lost, 2-1. But it was a diversion, nonetheless, as the miners try to distract themselves while rescue crews continue drilling down to save them on Day 34 of their ordeal. Ximena Matas, a spokeswoman for the Chilean minerals ministry, told reporters Wednesday that the drill being used in what's called rescue Plan A has driven through 28 more meters (about 31 yards) of earth since Tuesday for a total distance of 141 meters (154 yards).  The Plan B drill plunged 145 meters (158 yards) more, to reach a total of 268 meters (293 yards), she said, and equipment for the Plan C drill will begin arriving Wednesday evening. Plan A could take up to four months to reach the men, officials have said.  The Plan B operation could get to them in two months,  while the Plan C option -- which could turn out to be the fastest -- may not be ready to put into action until late September, authorities have said. The workers are trapped at a depth of 2,300 feet inside of a chamber in the mine.  When rescuers first found them, the men told officials they had survived for more than 17 days by sharing a jar of peaches and small amounts of tuna and mackerel that were in their shelter. By last week, their meals included bread with ham and turkey, wine cookies, stroganoff with pasta primavera, peaches in juice, nutritional supplements, bread with caramel spread, chicken in sauce and plantains. A team of experts from NASA held meetings with Chilean officials Tuesday to discuss the miners' eventual extraction and their lives beyond that. Dr. Michael Duncan, the deputy chief medical officer at Johnson Space Center, said the Chileans viewed the extraction of the miners as the end of the rescue operations. The Americans suggested that given the delicate recovery and re-integration of the miners, the actual rescue was just but a step in a longer process. For example, there is their re-introduction to their families and society, and the pressures they will feel from others and the media, he said.  They will have to cope with a certain level of celebrity status for having survived in the mine, he added. NASA psychologist Al Holland, who was also a member of the U.S. delegation, said that the miners were in great spirits.  The fact that they had organized themselves into groups and established a hierarchy among themselves before being found in the mine was good for their mental well-being, he said. Holland said he shared with the Chileans ideas about the importance of sleep and wake cycles and creating a systematic way of positioning lighting to that end. Chilean Health Minister Jaime Manalich told CNN the miners have been assigned tasks underground.  The men have been divided into teams to manage the tubes that carry the supplies that are their lifeblood. One miner is in charge of setting the schedule of when they eat and sleep, another of nutritional matters and another of medical needs, he said. CNN's Patrick Oppmann in Copiapo contributed to this report.","The miners were able to watch a soccer match live via a projector .

581,"Beijing, China (CNN) -- The death toll from an explosion at a factory in eastern China now stands at 10 people, state-run Xinhua news agency said, citing a casualty count from local government officials. At a news conference, officials in the city of Nanjing told reporters that more than 120 people had been hospitalized after a blast ripped through an abandoned plastics factory Wednesday morning. Fourteen of those hospitalized were critically injured, officials said. Workers were dismantling the factory when the explosion occurred. A statement from the state Administration of Work Safety said the explosion came when a motorist started a car engine and ignited leaking gas. The administration says the gas leak occurred after a propylene pipeline was damaged by heavy machinery used to dismantle factory buildings. The damaged pipeline that had been funneling propylene to the factory has been shut down, it said. According to Xinhua, the rescue headquarters says an excavator owned by Yangzhou Hongyuan Construction and Development Co., Ltd. hit the pipeline. The news agency also reports that the excavator operator has been held by police for questioning.","NEW: The death toll rises in a factory explosion .

583,"Mentawai Islands, Indonesia (CNN) -- The toll climbed to 413 dead and 298 missing four days after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck off Indonesia's coast, triggering a tsunami, officials said Friday. The National Disaster Coordinating Agency said 270 people were seriously injured and 142 had minor injuries. More than 22,000 people have been displaced or affected by the tsunami, which swept up villagers and their homes without warning, the agency said. The government is considering relocating some residents in the earthquake-prone islands near Sumatra, the state-run Antara news agency said. Organization: Tsunami warning system worked . ""President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has instructed me to draft a government regulation related to the relocation plan. We will discuss this matter soon after the emergency response period and rehabilitation of the impacted area are over,"" said People's Welfare Minister Agung Laksono. It's been difficult to protect Indonesia's small islands with a tsunami warning system, but most of them will be covered by February 2011, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of the Indonesian national board for disaster management. The effectiveness of a warning system also would depend on the size of a tsunami and residents' proximity to it. Monday's tsunami destroyed or carried away 517 homes, officials said. On the country's hard-hit Mentawai Islands, at least six of the 27 villages were ""practically been flattened,"" state media said, citing the governor of West Sumatra. The quake struck at 9:42 p.m. Monday, triggering a tsunami warning. Its epicenter was 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Padang, at a depth of 20.6 kilometers (12.8 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The magnitude was revised from a preliminary 7.5. The remoteness of many Indonesian islands left residents without warning, and continued to limit communications and stymie rescue and recovery efforts. Medicine and supplies being used to treat hundreds of injured residents are being depleted, Antara reported. On Friday, four warships from the naval base in Padang, West Sumatra, were to arrive to offer aid to victims in the Mentawai islands, according to Antara. The ships were carrying medical supplies and medical personnel from the marines, Antara said, citing Col. Indarto Budiarto. Volunteers, a helicopter and a plane also were aboard the ships. The naval base in Padang had set up aid command posts in the Mentawai waters, as well as medical command posts for victims, Antara said. A cargo plane also was ferrying supplies. The colonel also asked aid donors to channel supplies through the base in Padang. ""We are trying to prevent the accumulation of aid for Mentawai,"" he told Antara. The United States will provide $2 million in humanitarian assistance in response to this week's tsunami and the eruption of the Mount Merapi volcano, which killed dozens and displaced thousands, the U.S. ambassador in Indonesia announced Friday. The funds will be used to purchase relief items and help displaced people resume their lives, Ambassador Scot Marciel told students at the University of Indonesia, the embassy said in a statement. Earlier Friday, the European Commission announced it was offering 1.5 million euro ($2.1 million) to help the victims of the tsunami and the volcano eruption. ""This envelope will help around 65,000 people in Mentawai and at least 22,000 people in Yogyakarta/Central Java,"" the European Commission said in a news release. ""Humanitarian partners will use these funds to provide water and sanitation to victims; access to primary health care and disease control; food and nonfood items; emergency telecommunications, emergency shelter; psychological support; logistics and will mainstream disaster preparedness,"" the release said. The city of Padang and the Mentawai Islands are at the meeting place of two tectonic plates, making them vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off northern Sumatra. A tsunami generated by that earthquake killed more than 225,000 people in 14 countries -- mainly India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The Indonesian region of Banda Aceh was hard-hit: About 150,000 died there. CNN's Paula Hancocks and Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","Government considers relocating citizens .

584,"(CNN) -- As the two Australian miners lay trapped in a space less than 5 feet square and 3,000 feet below the surface, they discovered common ground in American country singer Kenny Rogers. ""I'm more rock and roll, he's more country, but we both knew 'The Gambler,' by Kenny Rogers,"" Brant Webb said of Todd Russell, who spent 14 days trapped with Webb in the Beaconsfield gold mine in northern Tasmania in 2006. The two sang to pass the time, shared their life stories and told jokes after a 2.2-magnitude earthquake triggered an underground rock fall, trapping them in darkness. They could not sit or stand. They were so cramped, one had to lie on his side if the other lay on his back. Five days into their captivity, rescuers located them and established a phone line. The men were kept abreast of rescue efforts and were given counseling throughout the ordeal. Rescuers also passed them food, water and iPods. But it would take another nine days for them to be extricated from the dank hole that Webb, at times, thought might become his grave. He never let the idea knock around his mind for too long, choosing to cling to hope that he would live to see his wife and two children. It's the same advice he has for 33 Chilean miners facing the prospect of remaining trapped 2,300 feet below ground for several months. ""They've got to keep their heads together and hope alive,"" Webb said in a telephone interview from his home in Beauty Point, Tasmania. ""They've got air, they've got food and water; they'll get them out of there eventually."" The miners have been trapped in the San Jose copper and gold mine in northern Chile since its roof collapsed on August 5. Rescuers took 17 days to locate them, during which the men rationed small amounts of tuna and mackerel to survive. Rescuers were eventually able to send supplies through a 4-inch pipe. On Friday, the miners were informed that it could take another three to four months to get them out. The miners and their families will face stresses that could continue once the men are freed, experts and those who have survived similar ordeals say. Chilean authorities have sought guidance from NASA and other institutions in the United States on how to help the miners cope with their environment on physical, mental and logistical levels. The most common comparison in academia to their situation and others like it is space travel. Astronauts and cosmonauts spend weeks or months in enclosed spaces cut off from society and loved ones, although to a lesser extent these days with the advancement of telecommunications. ""There is a dialogue going on between Chile's Ministry of Health and NASA, where we have a great deal of experience regarding medical, nutritional and behavioral issues related to space travel,"" State Department Spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday. ""[We] are providing that perspective to Chile, so that it can develop a program for helping to sustain these miners."" In addition to maintaining nutritional and hygienic needs, the men will need to develop a routine that resembles a normal life, down to mealtimes, showers and light to mimic daytime, said Joseph Barbera, co-director of the Institute for Crisis, Disaster, and Risk Management at George Washington University. ""A large part of maintaining their mental well-being is allowing them to have a sense of control over the situation. That's part of the reason why you want to develop a routine,"" said Barbera, who is also a member of the Fairfax County Urban Search & Rescue Task Force in Virginia, which has offered assistance to the Chilean government through the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. The Chilean miners are already adopting various roles to help them through their ordeal and give structure to their existence. A shift leader is fulfilling a leadership role and another man with nursing experience is carrying out basic medical and psychological tests. Maintenance mechanics helped organize the space. The men have split into two shifts so half can rest while the others keep busy doing tasks, exercising or playing card games or dominoes. Stretchers that were stored in the rescue cabin are being used as beds. They hold daily meetings and make decisions by consensus, according to a video the men sent to the surface Thursday. Barbera, along with Webb and others who have shared the harrowing experience of being trapped in isolation, agreed that one asset the Chilean miners have is space. Portions of a 131-foot-long (40-meter) shaft are being used as a latrine. The shaft is connected to the main 538-square-foot (50-square-meter) cabin, which is being used for sleeping, washing and praying. ""[The space] makes a significant difference, because it's not so cramped that they can't stretch out. It sounds like they'll have enough space to move around and potentially have some personal space and privacy,"" Barbera said. ""The big downside is length of time, as far as how long it'll take to get them out,"" he said. ""If they can maintain their psyche and develop a regular routine to stay psychologically fit, hopefully, they'll make it. But this situation has no precedent."" Like the Chileans, who have asked for playing cards and religious figures to create a shrine, the Australian miners also received items to pass the time, including magazines, iPods, toothbrushes and clothes. When food first began to come, however, in the form of sweets, the rush of sugar overwhelmed their systems, making the situation even more unpleasant, Webb said. ""That was definitely a low point,"" Webb said, laughing. Maintaining contact with people on the surface, especially loved ones, will help the Chilean miners, he said. ""That was a big stumbling block, thinking that if anything did happen I never coulda said, 'I love my wife,' "" Webb said. The Chilean workers sent a video message to their families Thursday in which they expressed thanks for the efforts under way to free them and assured them they were OK. Nine coal miners trapped in southwestern Pennsylvania in 2002 wrote notes to their loved ones as water inched within 70 feet of where they sat huddled. The letters were sealed in a bucket to be found with their bodies, said Mary Pugh, whose son, Robert Pugh, was one of the men known now as the ""Quecreek 9."" All were rescued. She has never seen her son's letter, nor does she want to. ""It was just so sad, such a sad time. I don't want to hear the story again unless my son wants to tell me,"" said Pugh, a lifelong resident of Somerset County, Pennsylvania. Her father, husband and brothers have all spent time in the mines. For nearly five days in July 2002, Pugh awaited news at the Sipesville Fire Hall, surrounded by children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, as well as the families of the eight other miners. Together, they rode out the ups and downs of the rescue effort with support from the community. ""It was crowded, food galore. They kept bringing the breakfasts, lunches, dinners, we didn't have to cook all weekend,"" she said. ""But we always came home to sleep because it was so crowded. Not that we actually slept."" The first few days that her husband and son-in-law were trapped, Denise Foy could not bring herself to sleep or eat. ""I thought that if he's not going to eat, I'm not going to eat,"" she said. ""But I worried more for my daughter than for me because her husband was down there, too. She was really taking it hard. To have your father and husband in there, it was a lot worse for her because those were the two main men in her life."" Most of the Quecreek 9 declined to speak to CNN about the incident. But Thomas Foy said the key to their survival was simple: ""stick together, keep warm and stay alive."" ""We went through hell the first time, trying to escape. We were swimming through water up to our chins. We tried three different entries, but weren't nothing we could do. They were all full. But when we heard them drilling we knew it was just gonna take time. We weren't about to give up."" Words were scarce as the men sat in darkness more than 200 feet below ground, soaking wet and huddled together for body heat, Foy said. ""Wasn't too many things to talk about; about how long it's gonna take, but we really didn't know. We just sat and waited and waited and waited, talked about how we're never gonna go back in the mines,"" he recalled. The first stage of preparing the Australians for their rescue began with injections of blood thinners they administered to themselves to prevent clots as a result of lying down for two weeks, Webb said. After the rescue, the real work of returning to society a new person began, not just for the survivors, but for their families. ""Your loved ones need to be ready for the emotional highs and lows. There's this huge high when you get out, then life goes back to normal, and you go back down,"" he said. Webb, now a part-time real estate agent, said he has watched only four movies since he's been out. ""The highs and lows are so extreme. When I'm sad, I cry. When I'm happy, I laugh a lot, probably too much. And your family needs to be ready to deal with all that."" Webb said he and Russell followed advice to do speaking engagements about their ordeal to exorcise their mind of the experience. That, along with three years of counseling and a two-week caving expedition have got him to a place where he's happy. ""Just one of those things, fall off the bike and get back on it. I didn't want to have a hang-up. But I have found a new career.""

585,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia's Mount Merapi started spewing hot ash clouds Monday morning, sending a 1.5-kilometer plume toward the south. Volcanic ash also blew eastward toward Boyolali, Central Java, said Kurniadi of the Indonesian Volcanology and Geological Disaster Monitoring staff. Kurniadi goes by one name, as many Indonesians do. Residents on the volcano started fleeing yet again. Many had returned to their homes to check on them as well as their farm animals after eruptions last week. Mount Merapi began erupting Tuesday and has killed at least 39 people in the past week. Another 74 have been injured and more than 71,000 people have been evacuated, according to the National Disaster Management Board. The 3,000-meter Merapi is famously unpredictable. An eruption killed two people in 2006 and another killed more than 60 villagers in 1994. About 1,300 people died when Merapi erupted in 1930. Also last week, a 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia's coast, triggering a tsunami and killing at least 449. Hundreds more were injured.","NEW: Death toll from recent eruptions is now 39 .

586,"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A disorganized Tropical Storm Tomas limped toward the central Caribbean Monday, but forecasters said the storm could re-intensify into a rare November hurricane later this week. As of 5 p.m. Monday, the center of Tomas was about 65 miles (105 kilometers) north-northeast of Aruba and about 400 miles (640 kilometers) south-southeast of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph), with higher gusts, and was moving west at 12 mph (19 kph). No coastal watches or warnings were in effect associated with Tomas, according to the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center. But the center urged residents of Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti to keep an eye on the storm, which is expected to continue westward over the next day or two and slow down. Tracking maps show that Tomas could take a sharp turn to the northeast and approach Haiti later in the week, possibly as a Category 1 hurricane. The storm could deal another blow to the island nation, which is still recovering from a devastating January earthquake and currently battling a cholera outbreak. But ""Tomas could still hit anywhere from the Dominican Republic to eastern Cuba,"" CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. Tropical storm-force winds extend out 140 miles (220 kilometers) from Tomas' center, mainly to the east, the Hurricane Center said. Tomas is expected to continue weakening, but ""restrengthening could begin by late Tuesday,"" forecasters said. The forecast track for Tomas, a storm which formed in late October, is typical for November hurricanes, CNN meteorologist Bonnie Schneider wrote on a blog for HLN's ""Morning Express."" Although hurricanes are less likely to form in November, ""the month isn't always hurricane-free,"" Schneider said. ""Two fairly recent November hurricanes include Hurricane Lenny in 1999 and Hurricane Michelle in 2001."" September is usually the most likely month for tropical storm formation, according to Schneider. But ""often this time of year, the westerly wind is strong enough to steer the storms out to sea into the Atlantic, rather than northwestward into the Gulf of Mexico."" The Atlantic hurricane season ends November 30. Tomas lashed the Caribbean island of St. Vincent over the weekend, prompting about 1,000 people to enter shelters. Two people were injured, including one critically, when they tried to repair roof damage during the storm, said Michelle Forbes, acting director of National Emergency Management. Tomas also left downed trees that blocked many roads, Forbes said, and large areas of the island lacked power. More than 100 homes sustained roof damage, she said, and authorities expected the number to rise.

587,"(CNN) -- At least 18 people were killed Saturday when chaos broke out at a music festival in Duisburg, Germany, police said. The panic at ""Love Parade 2010"" left ""many"" injured, according to police, who declined to give a specific number because many of those injured were taken to hospitals around the country, including some who had to be airlifted. Carsten Lueb of CNN affiliate NTV said that the number of injured was possibly into the hundreds. German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a statement offering her condolences to the victims' families, saying ""my sadness and empathy goes out to them."" ""The young people came to celebrate; instead people were killed and injured,"" the statement said. ""I am distraught and sad in the face of the suffering and pain."" Lueb told CNN that some 1.4 million people showed up at the popular festival, which features dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours. Organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so they opened an additional event site to accommodate more people. The deadly crush happened in an underpass between the main event site and the expansion area. Witnesses told NTV that people pushed into the tunnel from both sides until it was dangerously overcrowded. The panic began as festival-goers began to lose consciousness as they were crushed against the walls and each other. After the panic, a line of emergency vehicles, including helicopters, could be seen parked on the highway leading to the festival site, carrying away people injured in the crush. The festival itself, however, went on. Police were afraid that ending the music altogether could cause further unrest among the massive crowd. Witnesses also told NTV that police were warned at least an hour before the incident that the underpass was becoming dangerously crowded. NTV reported that there were 1,400 police officers on hand to monitor the event. The festival was supposed to take place from 2 p.m. (8 a.m. ET) to midnight. By the evening, the entrance and adjacent roadway remained closed. Thousands inside the venue continued dancing, but many could be seen leaving the area. The Love Parade was first held in the German capital, Berlin, in 1989.

588,"(CNN) -- The death toll from a cholera outbreak in Haiti has risen to more than 330, and officials believe Hurricane Tomas may worsen the situation as it approaches, a U.N. spokeswoman said Saturday. The number of confirmed cholera cases has climbed to 4,764, with 337 deaths, said Imogen Wall, spokeswoman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Haiti, citing information provided by the Haitian government. Those numbers represent the people that were able to make it to the hospital, she said. Another 200 cases are suspected in the nation's West Department, or province, she said. What is cholera? Tracking maps show Hurricane Tomas nearing Haiti on Thursday as a Category 3 hurricane. U.N. peacekeepers said Thursday that preliminary tests on a suspected source of the cholera outbreak were negative. The U.N. mission in Haiti is testing waste and sewage water at the back of a Nepalese military base that is part of the U.N. operations. The first tests showed no signs of cholera, officials said earlier this week. The mission said it ""has taken very seriously the allegations that sewage water coming from latrines at the back of the Nepalese military base in Mirebalais could be the source of the cholera outbreak in Haiti."" Cholera cases up worldwide . Suspicions about the Nepalese base arose from reports that water was collecting at the back of the base. It was believed to be overflow from the latrine or a septic tank. U.N. engineers examined the base and concluded that the standing water was not from the latrine of septic tank, but from a soak pit that receives water from the kitchen and the shower area, the U.N mission said. ""This soak pit is located three meters from the latrines, hence misleading passers-by into believing that the soaked ground close to latrines is caused by the overspill of human waste,"" it said. All human waste from the camp is collected in seven septic tanks that are emptied out and discharged in a local landfill as authorized by the local government, the United Nations said. The agency also noted that all 710 Nepalese soldiers underwent medical tests, and tested negative for cholera, before deployment to Haiti earlier this month.","The death toll from a cholera outbreak is 337 .

589,"Kalam, Pakistan (CNN) -- If you've ever been on the subway during rush hour in one of the world's major cities you will understand how crammed the U.S. Army Chinook was taking off from the flood ravaged town of Kalam in the Swat district of North West Pakistan. Normally the CH-47 Chinooks can carry up to 100 people, but according to a Pakistani officer charged with counting the passengers there were more than 120 on board when Lieutenant Colonel John Knightstep's chopper lifted off. It was another show of how the U.S. military is pushing the boundaries trying to help those who have lost everything in the floods that hit Pakistan more than six weeks ago. ""We're averaging about 200,000 pounds (91,000 kilograms) of aid every day,"" Knightstep said in an interview with CNN. ""We are also helping displaced people, ferrying about 200 per day, if not more."" The U.S. military has 18 helicopters from the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade out of Wainwright, Alaska, flying aid missions to the Swat district of North West Pakistan. The crews will be on missions for about eight hours every day usually flying aid into ravaged towns like Kalam and evacuating residents from the area. The Swat district is considered one of the most beautiful areas in all of Pakistan with mountains almost 20,000 feet high. But the mountainous terrain also makes flying challenging for the crews. ""Some of the areas we fly into are kind of small, because we are landing into villages that don't normally have aircraft traffic. They're not set up to handle aircraft as big as this. So some of the landing sites are kind of small and it is a bit tricky to get several aircraft into there, but you just have to be careful and watch what's around you,"" said warrant officer Aron Cunningham, who flies a CH-47 Chinook. The town of Kalam, one of the main destinations for the aid-carrying U.S. helicopters, was considered one of the prime tourist destinations in Pakistan before the Swat river, which flows through the town, burst its banks on July 29. The rising waters literally tore large chunks out of the city destroying many of the town's prime hotels. ""Seeing the people that we are moving around, seeing the damage that has been done to their villages, they have been cut off from their road network, their access to food and basic supplies, that we tend to take for granted,"" said Cunningham. ""So helping them is certainly a rewarding experience for us."" The U.S. crews even fly produce for farmers in areas cut off from road access so they can get their goods to local markets. Swat also has political significance for the U.S. and Pakistan. Until last year, the district was ruled by militants like the Taliban before the Pakistani military cleared the area, and the population is very distrustful of the United States. So far, however, the troops say they have not seen any hostility from the local people. ""We've had no problems,"" said Knightstep. ""We've had no security issues, it has been safe. They are in need and from what I can see they are extremely happy to see us."" Most of the helicopters flying into the devastated areas are packed with aid as the military is trying to stockpile goods in Kalam and other places that are still cut off. They know once the winter arrives it will often be impossible to fly into Swat, even though, being a unit out of Alaska, the pilots are used to flying in extreme snow conditions. ""In terms of the mountains and the snow this will feel a lot like flying back home,"" said Cunningham as he was steering his Chinook toward a resupply point called Rubicon, where the helicopters are refueled and loaded with aid. The U.S. says the aid flights will continue until the job is done and that could take several months. Pakistani military officials say the chopper crews have been vital to their flood response efforts and have done a lot to improve America's standing in this part of the world.","U.S. military has 18 helicopters flying aid missions to Pakistan's Swat district .

590,"(CNN) -- A potentially fatal sheep and goat disease could spread from Tanzania into southern Africa, a United Nations agency warned, threatening millions of people's livelihoods and food supplies. Small ruminants' plague can cause death rates of up to 100 percent in sheep and goats, though it does not affect humans, the Food and Agriculture Organization warned. It could kill 50 million sheep and goats if it spreads into southern Africa, the agency said after an emergency mission to Tanzania, in east Africa. ""Sheep and goats are critical to food and income security for pastoral communities. The presence of the disease directly affects a family's wealth,"" agency's chief veterinary officer, Juan Lubroth, said Tuesday. He urged southern African nations to review border controls and surveillance and to make sure their veterinary services are prepared. And the agency advised Tanzania to ""initiate an emergency vaccination program"" in the north, where the outbreak is centered, and consider additional vaccination in the area bordering Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. Tanzania did not immediately issue a public response to the warning.","Small ruminants' plague affects sheep and goats, and can cause death rates of 100 percent .

A paramedic treats a victim of a suicide blast at a hospital in Dera Ismail Khan on Sunday.

No one was killed in the first blast, which happened at a cafe near a local college, said Haji Abdul Rauf, the town's mayor. Four residents and two police officers were killed and 20 others injured when a suicide bomber struck 10 minutes later, Rauf said. The attackers were targeting police by attracting a crowd with the first blast, the mayor said. A local journalist said two of the civilians killed were reporters who had arrived after the first explosion. Pakistan's forces have been battling Taliban and al Qaeda militants in the North West Frontier Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Some of the Taliban militants conducting attacks in neighboring Afghanistan have been based in the North West Frontier Province and nearby tribal regions. The resurgence of the Taliban has prompted U.S. commanders and the incoming Barack Obama administration to put more of a focus on confronting militants along the border. The attack on Sunday came one week after a suicide car bomber -- apparently targeting people voting to fill a national assembly seat -- killed at least 37 people and wounded 16 others in the Bunair district of North West Frontier Province. In November, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives in the midst of a funeral procession in Dera Ismail Khan, killing at least seven people and injuring 30 more, police said. Days earlier, a suicide bomber struck a mosque during evening prayers in the Bajaur region of the North West Frontier Province, killing seven people. Journalist Janullah Hashimzada in Peshawar, Pakistan, contributed to this report.","Suicide bomber kills six people after early explosion attracts crowd .

592,"(CNN) -- New Zealand's air force has gone to the rescue of a sick American -- in Antarctica. A crew of 12, plus three medics, flew to evacuate the man Tuesday from the U.S. research base at McMurdo Station. There were limited details about the man's health, but he had an illness, rather than an injury, said New Zealand Air Force Squadron Leader Kavae Tamariki. A rescue team initially set off Monday from Christchurch, but was forced to turn back after about an hour. With the snow, ""You weren't able to see anything,"" Tamariki said. There also was snow on the runway at McMurdo. The second flight was able to touch down safely in Antarctica on Tuesday, despite temperatures of 35 below zero Celsius, he said. ""She's landed, and we're just waiting for confirmation that they've taken off,"" Tamariki said from New Zealand on Tuesday afternoon. The plane was expected back in Christchurch by Tuesday night, after a flight of 6 1/2 hours. It's the second time in six months that New Zealand's Air Force has been asked to rescue a sick American from McMurdo, because the Air Force is familiar with Antarctic weather and flying conditions, Tamariki said. It was unclear what the man in Tuesday's rescue was doing at McMurdo Station, but research is done at and near the station in aeronomy and astrophysics, biology and medicine, geology and geophysics, glaciology and glacial geology, and ocean and climate systems. McMurdo was established in 1955 to serve as the logistics hub of the U.S. Antarctic Program. The station -- on the southern tip of Ross Island, on the shore of McMurdo Sound -- has a harbor, a helicopter pad, and landing strips on sea ice and shelf ice, according to the station's website. The station, which is like a small town, includes repair facilities, dormitories, administrative buildings, a firehouse, a power plant, a water distillation plant and stores. Recorded temperatures there have fallen as low as 50 degrees below zero Celsius. Because of the tilt of the Earth and its orbit around the sun, there are two seasons in Antarctica -- summer and winter, or cold and colder. September is one of the coldest months.","A sick man needed evacuation from the U.S. research base at McMurdo Station .

593,"(CNN) -- Australian golfer Robert Allenby has written a new chapter in the volume of bizarre sporting injuries after tearing knee ligaments in a fishing accident. The world No. 14 slipped on the deck his boat ""C'mon Aussie"" while on a weekend excursion in the Bahamas, and is expected to be out for at least three weeks after undergoing surgery. Allenby was forced to withdraw from next week's U.S. PGA Championship, the final major tournament of the year. It's not the first time the 39-year-old has had cause to rue his love of fishing. He almost sat out the U.S. Open in June after wrenching his left wrist and forearm when his boat ran aground. Allenby is just the latest sports star to suffer a freak injury away from the field of play. In our photo gallery above, CNN World Sport takes a look at 10 of the most unusual.

594,"(CNN) -- MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi is back on his motorbike -- just a month after breaking his leg in a horrific crash. The seven-time world champion took to the track on Wednesday only four weeks after suffering a compound fracture of his shin during a collision in practice for the Italian Grand Prix. In a statement on Yahama's website the team confirmed Rossi would ride in Misano, Italy, in order to ""better understand his current physical condition."" It had been feared Rossi would miss up to four months of action after the accident but his progress has been better than expected. ""Valentino Rossi will ride a Yamaha YZF-R1 at a private test in Misano, Italy,"" Yahama said. ""The Italian has made an excellent recovery so far since breaking his leg at Mugello on 5th June and he has decided to proceed with the test ride in order to better understand his current physical condition. ""Riding a racing motorcycle will help Valentino and his doctors to plan the next stage of his rehabilitation program in order that he may return to racing as soon as he feels confident to do so. ""The test will take place using a YZF-R1 WSB machine provided by the Yamaha World Superbike Team to the Fiat Yamaha Team."" Rossi had never missed a MotoGP race before his leg break, but he has been forced to sit out four so far. If his test ride is successful the 31-year-old could be back for the next race in Germany on 18 July. His Yamaha team-mate Jorge Lorenzo currently leads the MotoGP standings, while Rossi lies in seventh place, 104 points off the lead.","MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi to take a test ride on Wednesday .

595,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The latest eruption of Indonesia's Mount Merapi volcano, on Friday, killed at least 54 people and severely burned 78, hospital officials said. Bodies recovered from a village about 16 kilometers (9.9 miles) from the volcano were badly burned, Commissioner Tjiptono of the Yogyakarta police told a local station, TV One. Mount Merapi began its latest eruptions on October 26. Friday's victims bring the total to 93 killed. The volcano has not stopped erupting since Thursday, the Volcanology and Geological Disaster Management Office said. An explosion Thursday night could be heard 30 kilometers (18 miles) away, and it continued to spew ash clouds. Earlier, Mount Merapi had belched a steady stream of gas and ash, unleashing a pair of powerful eruptions into the morning sky on Thursday. The hot clouds hovered over central Java, rising up to 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) and then drifting to the south toward Kali Gendol, Kali Kuning, Kali Boyong, Kali Krasak and Kali Bedok, according to the Indonesian Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Disaster Agency. Those affected by the latest eruption lived outside the 15-kilometer (9-mile) evacuation radius that had been established. The danger zone was expanded to 20 kilometers (12 miles) after Friday's eruption. Residents of a village 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from the volcano were ordered to move for safety, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of risk disaster reduction. Nearly 75,000 people have been evacuated, according to Indonesia's National Disaster Management Board. Residents on the volcano have repeatedly evacuated, but then returned to check on their houses and farm animals and fled anew with each fresh eruption. Because of rains, geological officials are warning residents and evacuees not to go to areas within the danger zone or near rivers. Rainfall can convert volcanic ash to lahar, or mudflow. There have been reports of mudflow headed down riverbeds on Merapi's slopes. The 3,000-meter (9,800-foot) Merapi is famously unpredictable. An eruption killed two people in 2006 and another killed more than 60 villagers in 1994. About 1,300 people died when Merapi erupted in 1930. In addition, last week, a 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia's coast, triggering a tsunami and killing at least 449 people. Hundreds more were injured.","NEW: 78 others have been severely burned .

596,"Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- Former President Jimmy Carter, spending a second night at a Cleveland, Ohio, hospital,  is recovering from a likely viral infection, according to a joint statement Wednesday from the hospital and the Carter Center. Carter, who suffered stomach distress Tuesday during a flight to Cleveland, was in ""very good spirits"" and will remain under doctors' observation at MetroHealth Medical Center, the statement said. ""His medical team ... has determined that the likely cause was a viral infection that is now clearing up,"" the statement said. ""President Carter thanks all those who have expressed concern and sent greetings to him."" Carter, who will turn 86 Friday, felt sick on his Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta, Georgia, to Cleveland on Tuesday morning. Emergency crews performed an initial checkup on the former president as soon as he landed and then transported him to MetroHealth. ""He is fully alert and participating in all decision-making related to his care,"" the hospital said earlier about Carter, who received a phone call from President Barack Obama. Carter was in Cleveland to sign copies of his new book, ""White House Diary,"" and planned to resume the book tour soon. His scheduled appearances in Washington on Wednesday were canceled. He and former first lady Rosalynn Carter are known as fitness buffs who maintain active lifestyles. Carter recently returned from a trip to North Korea, where he secured the freedom of U.S. citizen Mahli Gomes. During a September 20 appearance on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Carter said he planned to stay busy in the future. ""I'll stay involved in the Carter Center as long as I'm physically and mentally able,"" he said. ""I'm still a professor at Emory University. This is my 29th year as a professor. And I'll still write a book every now and then."" CNN's Allan Chernoff, Meg Miller, Mark Norman and Eden Pontz contributed to this report.","NEW: Jimmy Carter suffered likely viral infection .

597,"(CNN) -- Cases of disease are increasing in flood-ravaged Pakistan, but international relief funding for the disaster is drying up, the Oxfam aid organization said Friday. ""When the world's attention was focused on Pakistan's flood victims, there was a chance of seeing substantial aid being delivered. But as the worst of the flood waters have receded, so has the promise of significant funding,"" Neva Khan, Oxfam's director in Pakistan, said in a statement. But donations are still crucial to help people survive, the organization said. Three months after the devastating flooding, large areas in the southern province of Sindh remain underwater, and 7 million people are ""still without adequate shelter."" ""While the response from some donors and the public has been generous, the U.N.'s Pakistan flood appeal for just over $2 billion, is only 38 percent funded,"" the organization said. Citing United Nations figures, Oxfam said 10 million people need immediate food assistance. ""The funding shortfall is so serious that existing regular food rations to 3.5 million people could be in jeopardy,"" the organization said. The floods caused $9.7 billion in damage to homes, roads, farms and other parts of the southwestern Asian country, according to estimates from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. The flooding began in early August, and flood waters continued to rage in the countryside more than seven weeks later. More than 1,700 people died due to the flooding, according to Pakistani authorities, while more than 20 million were displaced. The rushing waters washed out large swaths of farmland, destroying crops and families' livelihoods. ""The water is six feet high. No one will be able to plant anything,"" said Mohamad Razi, 19, according to Oxfam. ""We should be planting next month, but we will have to wait a year."" The Sindh province resident, who is staying at a relief camp, said many have no choice but to rely on assistance from others. ""We have to depend on the government for help. We have nothing here,"" he said. Last week, United States officials announced a $2 billion, multiyear security assistance package to help Pakistan fight extremists taking refuge in safe havens along its border with Afghanistan -- noting that the Pakistani military is stretched thin dealing with flood disaster relief.","Oxfam says large areas in Sindh province remain underwater .

598,"(CNN) -- A 12-year-old male killer whale, who showed signs of being ill only the day before, died Tuesday afternoon at SeaWorld in San Diego, California, the park announced. The cause of death for Sumar won't be known until a necropsy is complete, SeaWorld said. Results may not be known for several weeks. ""It's a very sad day,"" spokesman Dave Koontz told CNN. ""He was a great young killer whale. He was sharp."" Sumar, who weighed about 5,000 pounds, had been at SeaWorld San Diego since 2001, coming from an Ohio park. He was one of seven killer whales at SeaWorld and was able to exhibit about 100 ""behaviors,"" Koontz said. The killer whale had no medical history or problems with behavior, the spokesman said, adding that there was no evidence of communicable disease. ""He had a great disposition."" ""Trainers had noticed that Sumar was acting lethargic yesterday (Monday) afternoon. Park veterinarians began a regimen of antibiotics to help try to stabilize his condition while they attempted to determine the cause of his illness,"" a SeaWorld statement said. ""His condition worsened today and a decision was made to cancel the 12:30 p.m. Shamu show, so that trainers and veterinarians could continue to devote their full attention to Sumar. Despite these efforts, Sumar did not survive."" Sumar's trainers and support staff were devastated by the sudden loss and are sharing stories, Koontz said. ""The loss of any animal is difficult, but that was even more so."" Orlando, Florida-based SeaWorld was recently fined $75,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for three safety violations, including one classified as willful, after an animal trainer was killed by a whale in Orlando in February. SeaWorld, which also has a location in San Antonio, Texas, said it would contest the violations. The last killer whale to die at the San Diego venue was Splash, who was sickly when SeaWorld adopted him. He was nursed back to health and lived 15 years until 2005. No public memorial for Sumar is planned, although fans will be able to comment on the park's Facebook page, Koontz said. SeaWorld said its shows would resume on schedule Wednesday.","Killer whale dies at SeaWorld in San Diego, California .

599,"(CNN) -- Qantas, Australia's national airline, grounded its Airbus A380 fleet indefinitely after one of its planes suffered a midair engine failure on Thursday. The airline said flights of the twin-deck planes -- the world's largest airliners -- will remain suspended until an investigation into Thursday's incident is complete. ""As long as it takes,"" said airline CEO Alan Joyce, when a reporter asked how long the suspension would last. ""We are being very cautious until we know exactly what caused this."" One of the four engines on a Qantas airliner shut down six minutes after takeoff Thursday from Singapore's Changi Airport, Joyce said. The plane -- with 440 passengers and 26 crew members -- was headed to Sydney, Australia, but it returned to Changi. While in the air above the western Indonesian island of Batam, part of the engine's covering, or cowling, tore off. ""I am not sure what actually happened with the debris and why parts of the engine left the aircraft and fell into the ground,"" Joyce said. ""We're still looking at what exactly was the cause of that."" The pilot made an announcement updating passengers during the flight. ""I do apologize,"" the pilot said. ""I'm sure you are aware we have a technical issue with our number two engine. We have dealt with the situation, the aircraft is secure at this stage. We're going to have to hold for some time whilst we do lighten our load by dumping some fuel and a number of checklist [items] we have to perform. ""I'm sure you are aware we are not proceeding to Sydney at this stage. We're making a left turn now to track back toward Singapore and as we progress with this we'll keep you informed, but at this stage everything is secure, the aircraft is flying safely and we'll get back to you very shortly with further information. Thank you for your patience."" Local television stations in Indonesia showed debris parts with red-white markings. Pictures of the Airbus A380 after it landed showed the cowling torn off in the back half. Trifuadi, a security officer at an engineering firm in Batam, said he heard a loud explosion and saw smoke coming out of the engine of a plane flying overhead. Shortly afterward, debris fell from the plane to the ground, said Trifuadi who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name. The flight -- QF32 -- landed in Singapore safely, without injury to passenger or crew. Passenger Meg Graham said she heard a loud bang within minutes of the plane taking off. ""And then another bang,"" she said. Ulf Waschbusch, who said he was on his way to Australia for the first time, said the crew kept passengers apprised of what was happening. ""We all stayed pretty calm,"" he told CNN. ""It was an almost eerie calm."" The airline said it will work with the plane's manufacturer as well as Rolls-Royce, the maker of the engine, to determine what went wrong. A spokesman for the Rolls-Royce told CNN that ""safety is always our highest priority.

600,"(CNN) -- Police in Jackson, Mississippi, have prepared an arrest warrant for former television host Gary Collins for leaving the scene of an accident, police spokesman Colendula Green told CNN. Officers were called to the scene Monday afternoon but when police arrived, only one of the parties involved was there. The victim ""had been stopped at a red light and was rear-ended by a white Jeep, driven by Gary Collins,"" Green said. Collins' lawyer, Tom Royals, said his client had gotten out of his vehicle, examined the accident, and exchanged information with the driver of the other car. After calling the police, Collins left because he had been waiting for some time and he thought he had done all that was required, Royals said. ""The other party knew his information,"" Royals said. ""And in fact Collins knew someone in the car. They talked a while and then he left."" Green agreed that the ex-actor had provided his contact information but said Jackson Police have cited Collins for leaving the scene of an accident, a misdemeanor. Police are waiting to execute the arrest warrant once a judge signs off on it. The other driver is pressing charges, Green said. ""It was not a serious accident,"" Royals said. ""It was really just a minor fender-bender."" Collins is known for being a TV and radio personality, and is married to former Miss America Mary Anne Mobley. As an actor, he is known his role in the television series ""The Sixth Sense,"" and ""The Wackiest Ship in the Army.""","Gary Collins is a former television host and actor .

601,"Washington (CNN) -- Just five days before the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's devastating assault on the Gulf coast, millions of dollars are heading to public and private projects for Louisianans still trying to recover, two top Obama administration officials said at a news conference Tuesday. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Janet Napolitano and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate detailed how, courtesy of the federal disaster recovery fund established under the Stafford Act, seven projects in Louisiana will receive more than $26.8 million to contribute to the rebuilding process. In a statement released later Tuesday by the DHS, a grant of more than $1.6 million to a Mississippi project was added to the list. The latest projects are in addition to about $2.5 billion in funds the Obama administration has given to the region for renewal since President Barack Obama took office in January 2009, Napolitano said. ""Over the past 20 months, this administration has cut bureaucratic red tape that had slowed recovery and expedited assistance across the Gulf Coast,"" Napolitano said in a statement. ""We will continue to work with our federal, state and local, private sector, faith-based and nonprofit partners, as well as Gulf Coast residents, to ensure local communities have the assistance they need to rebuild the region stronger than ever."" According to the statement, the new projects include: . In Orleans Parish, Louisiana: . -- more than $11 million to rebuild the Xavier University student center . -- more than $2.7 million for the Archdiocese of New Orleans St. Martin Manor Yellow Masonry Assisted Living Complex . -- more than $2.5 million to help the archdiocese fix damaged classrooms at the Our Lady of Lourdes School . In St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana: . -- more than $1.4 million to rebuild the Salmen High School athletic department facilities . In St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana: . -- more than $5.1 million for sewer repairs . In Cameron Parish, Louisiana: . -- $3 million for a recreational center and gymnasium . In Jefferson Parish, Louisiana: . -- roughly $1.1 million to reconstruct 12 properties so they meet building codes regarding base elevation and flood safety . In Hancock County, Mississippi: . -- More than $1.6 million to upgrade Hancock North Central Elementary . Fugate said the Jefferson Parish funding was related to damage from Hurricane Rita, rather than Katrina. Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Louisiana coast on August 29, 2005. It was the costliest and one of the five deadliest hurricanes to ever strike the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center. ""Considering the scope of its impacts, Katrina was one of the most devastating natural disasters in United States history,"" the hurricane center says. Hurricane Rita made landfall less than a month later, on September 24, in extreme southwestern Louisiana near the Texas border, producing significant storm surge that devastated coastal communities in southwestern Louisiana, according to the hurricane center.","NEW: The federal government is sending more than $26.8 million to Louisiana to help with rebuilding projects .

602,"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Health and hospital officials in Haiti braced for the worse Monday, fearing the hurricane that battered the Caribbean nation over the weekend could worsen the cholera outbreak that has killed hundreds of people and hospitalized thousands since it began last month. The official death toll attributed to the outbreak was 544, with more than 8,000 confirmed cases, Health Minister Alex Larsen told CNN. On Monday, Dr. Toni Eyssallenne of Hospital Bernard Mevs confirmed the first case of cholera -- in a 3-year-old boy -- to originate and manifest entirely in Port-au-Prince. Previous cases had been centered in Haiti's Artibonite and Central Plateau regions, including the city of St. Marc, north of the nation's capital. Until now, health officials said that those being treated for cholera in Port-au-Prince all contracted the disease elsewhere. The young Port-au-Prince boy lived in a tent city across the street from a place that sells macaroni, and he had not traveled in over a year nor had he had contact with people from St. Marc or the Artibonite region, Dr. Eyssallenne said. After suffering from nausea and diarrhea, the boy was treated and released from the hospital after his condition improved. This was one of scores of tests being carried out on 91 residents of the capital -- all of whom live in or near the city's densely populated Cite Soleil slum, Larsen said. Except for one person who died over the weekend, all the others have recovered, he said. Hurricane Tomas' trek past Haiti killed 20 people and injured another 36, a Communications Ministry official said Monday. Seven people were missing and 5,954 were homeless, the official said. Health officials fear that the water dumped by the storm will worsen the outbreak. The concern is that overflow from latrines and septic tanks could contaminate the supply of fresh drinking water and contribute to the spread of the bacteria. In the capital, the canals were not overflowing, said American Red Cross spokeswoman Andrea Koppel. But that was not the case in cities west of the capital, which bore the brunt of Hurricane Tomas, she said. Still, even Port-au-Prince looks and smells like a dump -- a caldron of water, garbage and human waste. ""We get used to it,"" said one resident. Ten months after a magnitude-7 earthquake laid waste to much of the nation, people compete with animals scavenging through the ubiquitous dumps for scraps of food. ""The quick solution is management,"" said Environment Minister Jean Marie Claude Germain. ""Management meaning that you have a structure in place, but the structure was not conceived with the slums in mind."" But most of the residents of Port-au-Prince live in slums. ""We're working on it,"" Germain said. ""We will work with the private sector.""

603,"London, England (CNN) -- British Airways on Friday announced a pre-tax loss of 164 million pounds ($256.5 million) for the three months ending June 30. The airline's chief executive, Willie Walsh, cited strikes by BA cabin crews and closures from the Icelandic volcano as reasons for the loss. In April, the eruption of a volcano beneath the Eyjafjallajokull glacier in Iceland grounded flights to and from the United Kingdom for several days amid concerns over safety. Cabin crew staff walked off the job in series of strikes during the quarter in a dispute over pay and working conditions -- a dispute that is yet to be resolved. In the trading statement Friday, BA said the combined disruptions cost the airline 250 million pounds ($390 million), in line with previous estimates. The airline said its operating loss had shrunk to 72 million pounds ($112 million) compared with the same quarter last year, as it reined in costs and increased passenger and cargo yields. Fuel costs were also lower. The airline said passenger revenue fell during the period, although yields improved ""driven by a change in mix especially within cabin."" Without the disruption to flights during the period, passenger revenue would have increased by 11 percent compared with the previous year, the company said. Looking ahead, the airline said it was maintaining its forecast to break even in the full year, despite bleak predictions from some analysts about a return to recession. ""While some economic experts are flagging the risk of a 'double-dip' recession, the steady recovery continues and, on that basis, we continue to target to break even at a profit before tax level for the full year as we move forward on our strategic objectives and continue to build on our excellent customer service,"" Walsh said.

604,"(CNN) -- Jordan's Queen Rania was recuperating in a New York hospital Monday after she underwent a medical procedure to correct an irregular heart rhythm. ""The procedure went very smoothly and Her Majesty is well and in good spirits,"" the Royal Court in Amman said in a statement Monday. She will remain hospitalized for two nights while she recovers before returning home later in the week, the palace said. Rania was in New York with her husband, who is attending the United Nations General Assembly. Rania's procedure involved placing a catheter through a vein to the heart. An electric current was then used to stop the disturbance of electrical flow through the heart, the palace said. As a result, the heart's normal rhythm was restored, it said. The procedure is used to treat premature ventricular contractions -- extra, abnormal heartbeats that begin in the heart's two lower pumping chambers. These extra beats disrupt the regular heart rhythm, sometimes causing patients to feel a flip-flop or skipped beat in their chests, a definition on the Mayo Clinic's website says. The site says premature ventricular contractions are common and occur in most people at some point. Most people with premature ventricular contractions and an otherwise normal heart don't need treatment. CNN's Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.","Rania will rest for two nights before heading back to Jordan .

605,"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- One month ago, the San Jose copper and gold mine in Chile caved in, trapping 33 miners far underground. For the next 17 days, their families had no idea whether they were alive or dead. Here in their words, some of the wives, fathers and daughters think back to the first moments after learning of the accident and their efforts to keep hope alive. Lila Ramirez, wife of Mario Gomez: ""I felt a lot of rage and pain and I felt powerless. I knew this was an accident waiting to happen. ""Mario asked the bosses to take measures so the miners didn't run the risk of getting buried. But they never listened. A lot of the miners said they had heard the mountain groaning. One said he didn't want to go down the mine that day, he was afraid. But the boss said to him either you go down or I have five other people who will go down. ""I never doubted that I had a lot of faith they were all alive and that they were all together and that's how they found them. All together!"" Jessica Yanez, partner of Esteban Rojas: ""Those first days were unforgettable it was huge uncertainty, just waiting and waiting. ""Those were very bitter moments. I was crying day and night. I didn't want to sleep. I didn't want to go home, because my loved one wasn't with me, and when I ate I got angry with myself because I thought of him going hungry. ""I held out hope Esteban had been outside the mine. When I was crying I hoped he was going to come out and hug me and say, 'Darling, I'm here.' But the hours went by and they reported the names of the missing miners and Esteban never came."" Scarlett Sepulveda, daughter of Mario Sepulveda: ""I felt rage and pain and frustration. I thought how can they be trapped like that. They're not animals. But here in Chile they've always treated our miners like animals. ""It's horrible. I miss him so much. My dad always cheered us up and made us laugh. I just feel so so bad. ""I was sad and disillusioned. I didn't want to hear anything more about the accident. It's not exactly that I lost hope. It's just I didn't want to get my hopes up too high."" Hector Ticona, father of Ariel Ticona: ""I was stunned by the news but I didn't cry. I'm not the kind to cry. But my wife began to cry and I tried to calm her down and said take it easy; we don't know anything for sure just yet. ""I always had faith and I stayed calm. And then what happened happened. And then the miracle came."" Elizabeth Segovia, wife of Ariel Ticona: ""I was cooking his evening meal and waiting for him to come home. ... When I heard about the accident my world just collapsed. I cried and cried. I couldn't even sleep for five days straight. But I had to try and be strong especially for my two sons."" Jessica Salgado, wife of Richard Alex Vega: ""At the time it didn't sink in that the accident had been so big. ... I cried a lot but I was trying to keep my spirits up because of the children. I kept phoning his cell phone and it just rang and rang and kept going to voice mail."" Jose Vega, father of Richard Alex Vega: ""I'm not the kind of person to sit there with my arms crossed and crying. I said my son needs my help and I'm going after him. ""I went into the mine with five others to try and find them. It was terrible, terrible. I looked up and the roof was opening. Rocks were falling down and I was looking for a way to make it through the shower of rocks. So I left Jose, the man, at the door, and Jose, the miner went inside. A miner must be brave. It's like the boxer when he steps into the ring. He must leave his fear outside."" Cristina Nunez, wife of Claudio Yanez: ""A friend phoned and said the San Esteban [San Jose] mine has just collapsed and the miners are trapped inside. I said, 'What? that can't be true!' And I began crying. I was crying and I couldn't talk I was just crying and crying. ... I said my Claudio can't leave me like this. Claudio has to be alive.""","Wives, fathers and daughters recall moment they learned of the accident .

606,"(CNN) -- Pakistan's cricket team have donated half their win bonuses to help the relief victims of a flood in their home nation. Having beaten England by four wickets in the third Test at the Oval last week -- leaving Pakistan 2-1 behind in the series with one Test left to play -- the nation's top cricketers offered $54,400 in a bid to help their stricken countrymen. The contribution to the flood relief effort, which was announced by the Pakistan Cricket Board, is the latest in a number of fund-raising efforts aimed at helping those who have been affected by the disaster in recent weeks. ""The PCB chairman has announced a winning bonus ... and all the players and officials have donated half of the bonus in flood-relief funds,"" the PCB said in a statement. This latest act of charity by the national cricket team comes just one week after it was announced that PCB officials, staff and national team players had donated $137,590 to the same cause. Shahid Afridi, Pakistan's one-day captain, and the country's leading umpire Aleem Dar have also run separate campaigns for flood relief, raising millions of rupees. The PCB have also revealed that they are planning a game against Zimbabwe to raise further funds for the flood victims. This would be the first international cricket that has taken place in Pakistan since March 2009, following the terror attacks on the touring Sri Lanka side. In recent weeks, the worst floods in the country's history have killed 1600 people and left 20 million without homes in the north-west and southern regions of Pakistan. The U.N. says it still needs $200 million more in aid.

607,"(CNN) -- Over 1.8 million gallons of dispersant chemicals have been added to the Gulf of Mexico to break up oil flowing from the Deepwater Horizon's ruptured well. And in the 100 days since the rig's explosion, little more has become known about the effects of those chemicals. In May, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Coast Guard directed BP to use a less toxic dispersant than the one it was putting into the Gulf, Corexit 9500. When the company did not comply, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson announced that the EPA would run its own toxicity tests, the first round of which focused on Corexit 9500 and seven other common, readily available dispersants from the agency's approved list. The tests showed Corexit to be slightly less toxic than the manufacturer's data had indicated, so no new orders were issued. ""We need more data before we decide whether to change dispersants,"" said Paul T. Anastas, the EPA's assistant administrator for research and development. ""Our ultimate goal in all of this is to reach a point where dispersants are no longer necessary."" Scientists say questions remain about the effects of dispersants, in particular the more subtle consequences. ""The only effect that's being looked [in acute toxicity tests] at is death, lethality. That is a place that testing often starts because you want to know what concentration of the chemical will kill fish or other organisms,"" said Richard Denison, senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. ""But what's much more relevant in predicting the full effects of the use of dispersants and dispersed oil are the more subtle effects -- that are sublethal, that may affect growth and reproduction."" Those sublethal effects may cause a population to diminish without necessarily killing organisms. Larvae and eggs are most at risk because they are more sensitive and less mobile. As for human health, scientists say much more needs to be learned about dispersants -- their behavior with oil, chemical ingredients, chronic and delayed effects -- to understand the risks. There are two types of potential exposures for humans, according to scientists: direct (by inhalation, ingestion or absorption through the skin) and indirect (by eating seafood). According to toxicologist Dr. LuAnn White of Tulane University, the risk to most humans is very low because the oil-dispersant mixture dilutes quickly and does not build up in the food chain. Some scientists disagree over dispersants' ability to break down the oil faster than it would naturally decompose. ""The conventional wisdom is that by breaking up oil into small droplets, it may be more easily biodegraded. That is not firmly established. In fact, there are conflicting data,"" said Denison. ""Some studies suggest that the rate of degradation of PAHs [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a breakdown product of oil] is actually impeded by dispersants."" Another unknown is whether the chemical constituents of oil are more or less likely to persist in the food chain. ""The problem has been that we have simply not required the answers to those questions. The fact that they are being asked now, and we don't have answers, is of particular concern given the magnitude and scale of use of dispersant."" According to Denison, more information is needed in order ""to be able to intelligently answer questions of whether we should still be using the dispersants."" ""I am not of the view that [dispersant] should or should not be used. I don't think we have enough data to answer those questions very well, and I'm hoping that this tragedy will spur us to answer those questions so we'll have enough information next time.""","EPA tested toxicity levels of eight common, readily available dispersants .

608,"San Bruno, California (CNN) -- At first, residents thought it was an earthquake. Or maybe a big airplane had crashed. San Bruno, after all, is adjacent to the San Francisco airport. They heard the booms. Then they saw the giant fireballs, some leaping 80 feet high. The flames were so hot, so intense, that the roar could be heard far away and the heat sucked up the air. They did not know then that a gas line that had ruptured and exploded, triggering a fire that would leave their town in apocalyptic hues. They would only find out later what had happened. But in the middle of the chaos, they simply tried to survive. Homes, lawns, cars -- everything burned. At least four people died. Many others gasped their way to hospitals, four of them fighting for their lives with excruciating third-degree burns. Read latest on California fire . Judy Serresseque felt her whole house shake as though a mighty quake was about to swallow northern California, her living room filled with an orange glow. ""When I went to my front door, I looked out and everything was just flames,"" said Serresseque, who fled with her husband. ""The heat was intense, and you could hear it, you could hear the hiss."" A ""big rumbling sound"" sent Bob Hensel's cats into hiding. He looked long and hard for them before he pried open the garage door to escape the flames. As he drove off, he could see the bumper of his wife's car melt away. The explosion occurred Thursday evening, sending concrete chunks flying through the air. The heat from the blaze melted tail lights on cars parked blocks away. In daylight Friday, 15 acres of San Bruno resembled more a war zone than a quiet suburban California neighborhood. ""I was standing next to a police officer who'd been in Baghdad, and he said he had never seen anything quite so bad as this,"" John Hampton, a freelance photographer who witnessed the fire, told CNN affiliate KGO. ""It looks as if this area was firebombed."" Another photographer, Bryan Carmody, documented the tragedy with his camera lens. He said the actual gas fire was contained to a small area, but houses just started catching fire, one after another. And the blaze turned into one continuous fireball. ""The fire would just move from one house to the next because the fire was burning so fast and so big and so intensely,"" he said. ""It was definitely a sight to see."" Residents under evacuation orders fled to shelters. Others spent a panicked night in darkness after electricity was cut off. They feared for their friends, families and themselves, not knowing the path and scope of the fire. On Friday, cadaver dogs were still searching as authorities feared more than four people had perished in the blaze. Sergio Campos was on his way to class at Skyline College when he saw the fire and pulled over. Even from a distance, he could hear the roar. But he, like so many other confused San Bruno residents, didn't know whether to run toward the inferno to try to save people, or drive as far away as he could. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.","At first, residents thought blast was a quake or a plane crash .
They heard the fire's roar and felt its intense heat .
The fire left 15 acres of San Bruno looking like a war zone .",1444 10751 846 122 12 69 1055 245 13 14 23 5795 50 1228 1 269 6621 32 2475 1444 10751 31 49 10 8330 2 0 1444 3156 1376 30 399 0 24052 92 30 318 0 1443 40192 76 12329 1410 942 220 0 4333 37 59 1471 59 2621 11 0 11853 72 22 399 253 170 3 0 2396 12007 39 0 564 30 116 26 143 92 11 1 1847 530 11 32 13726 3 4556 10155 1 664 11 52 466 34 674 4 21140 19688 30 52 80 256 40 151 64 32 407 18 4 0 779 5 0 3466 30 789 434 2 2472 1139 18976 1362 522 3492 12 296 156 62 304 106 313 22865 34 114 2 2745 156 5 73 911 6 34 400 9 12677 15010 4428 627 579 8 846 664 9410 516786 598 87 654 222 4679 16 315 1 11150 11371 14 44 2 10525 1132 846 87 505 545 1978 9 23 3149 9316 36 46 183 2 104 372 979 46 567 40 3 522 14 58 4333 21 516786 25 2110 9 87 595 0 2396 14 2621 3 78 72 1030 13 78 72 1030 0 48310 1 269 26549 1744 442 2922 87193 7 5245 54 3020 27 567 188 3 393 6 73 65 27 42152 415 0 4460 979 2 1735 0 4333 16 27 1981 99 27 72 127 0 11237 5 33 373 7 443 11128 170 0 3513 1319 409 909 1740 4108 12295 1547 112 0 564 0 2396 17 0 5358 10799 5943 2700 8 1362 3875 4040 170 4 7701 371 292 5465 5 1444 10751 12907 45 1 584 2512 60 1 2216 5202 846 2575 46 14 1161 153 2 1 159 685 25 341 29 4 6287 3 27 21 27 32 173 175 427 661 59 620 16 24 397 13953 1 9886 2647 25 2984 0 664 67 122 2837 40074 13 687 16 63 24 314 14 47976 119 2647 7065 72776 5697 0 1649 9 33 1137 7767 27 21 0 3082 1847 664 14 2845 2 1 392 314 18 2041 58 287 4882 664 35 31 119 3 0 5358 457 54 35 9197 15927 0 664 52 58 334 17 35 222 2 0 153 82 0 664 14 3304 59 1414 3 59 269 3 59 13501 27 21 13 14 1832 1 2434 2 127 1055 140 6946 2909 2110 2 8192 313 458 1 7961 189 4 6672 31 4019 14 699 99 30 2420 6 34 332 758 3 612 26 2117 0 2047 3 6456 5 0 664 8 371 22392 2503 37 117 2491 16 401 2420 45 60 156 62 32 11496 4 0 5358 4911 41234 14 8 33 114 2 1290 12 10303 1065 36 27 318 0 664 3 1128 56 101 17 1 2281 27 72 1030 0 11853 18 27 84 59 106 66 4227 1444 10751 1055 211 47 143 268 2 383 1469 0 14823 2 472 2 1036 62 50 1111 16 253 170 16 27 72 122 7 23636 22496 652 2 24 246,63d8693c2fdbf2bc2da5866c4007b3d5be6d703f,0.0
609,"(CNN) -- Rolls-Royce said Friday that the failure of a specific component of its Trent 900 engine caused an oil fire that then forced a Qantas A380 to make an emergency landing. ""The failure was confined to a specific component in the turbine area of the engine,"" the engine maker said. ""This caused an oil fire, which led to the release of the intermediate pressure turbine disc. "" The incident will cause the company's full year profit growth to be slightly lower than ""guided,"" Rolls-Royce said Friday. In July, the company had predicted its underlying profits would grow between four and five percent compared to 2009. On Monday, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told reporters the planes will not return to service until the airline is ""100 percent sure"" about their safety. Oil leaks have been discovered in engines on three planes, and investigations continue, Joyce added. The leaks were beyond normal tolerances, he said. On November 4, a Qantas flight was forced to return to Singapore's Changi Airport after one of its engines shut down and the engine's covering, or cowling, tore off above the western Indonesian island of Batam. The Australia-bound flight was carrying 440 passengers and 26 crew members.","Rolls-Royce: The incident will cause full year profit growth to be lower .

610,"London, England (CNN) -- Shares in Rolls-Royce rose Monday after the company announced that it had made progress in understanding the cause of a Qantas mid-air engine blow-out. The shares rose by 2.62 percent -- they had been 14 percent down from Thursday after the Australian carrier revealed early Monday that oil leaks had been discovered in the engines on three of its planes after being examined by Rolls-Royce engineers. This follows last week's aborted flight by an A380, which was forced to make an emergency landing in Singapore shortly after take off when one of its engines failed. Rolls-Royce on Monday issued a statement saying the Qantas problem was caused by an ""incident specific to the Trent 900 engine."" ""As a result, a series of checks and inspections has been agreed with Airbus, with operators of the Trent 900 powered A380 and with the airworthiness authorities,"" the Rolls-Royce statement continued. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told reporters the leaks were ""beyond normal tolerances"" and that the planes will not return to service until the airline is ""100 percent sure"" about their safety, . ""It is disturbing that Qantas found three more engines that needed to be looked at. That's a total of four,"" aviation consultant Peter Goelz told CNN. ""This is a relatively... young aircraft. These engines have probably less than 200,000 total hours, so it is an issue that we need to be concerned about."" New safety fears ground Qantas A380s . Singapore airlines and Lufthansa also operate the A380 equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, but they reported no problems after carrying out their own extensive checks. Their fleets are now flying again. Dubai-based Emirates also operate the double-decked Airbus A380 but with GP7000 engines, designed as part of a joint venture between U.S. manufacturers General Electric and Pratt and Whitney. These engines have not been part of the current safety scare. Before the share price recovery, more than $1.6 billion had been wiped off the value of British-based Rolls-Royce, its share value dropping by 14 percent since Thursday. Shares in EADS, which owns Airbus, were down by half a percent for the same period. ""We're looking at a period of time when investors will be pretty jittery,"" said Dan Thisdell of Flightglobal.com. ""But they've got to grapple with this problem in a way that maintains confidence among their prospective customers as well as existing customers. ""If it is some kind of underlying design flaw, though this would seem unlikely given the enormous expertise and modern computer simulation technology available to Rolls-Royce, then there could be a problem given the level of investment involved."" In August, another Rolls-Royce engine -- this time a Trent 1000 -- suffered an uncontained failure during testing in England. This particular model is designed to power Boeing's latest commercial aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner. Rolls-Royce said on Tuesday that the Trent 1000 issue was not connected to the Qantas Trent 900 incident. Rolls-Royce said in the statement: ""This incident happened during a development program with an engine operating outside normal parameters. We understand the cause and a solution has been implemented."" With at least half of the 850 787s on order destined to be powered by Trent engines, Thisdell told CNN that this will be another profitable source of income for a very long time. ""Many airlines have placed orders for aircraft years down the line and have not yet selected their preferred engine,"" he said. ""But no-one has a better reputation than Rolls-Royce. Many airlines will order Rolls-Royce engines as a matter of course because they've had first rate service from them for years. ""Not every airline see it this way, but many -- particularly small and medium-sized airlines -- feel some comfort in having a single supplier of engines for all the aircraft they fly because it provides some commonality with maintenance, spares and training for mechanics."" As if to reinforce this point, Rolls-Royce on Monday announced a new $350 million engine servicing contract with Egyptair, who operate a fleet of Airbus A330s fitted with Trent 700 engines.","Rolls-Royce says Qantas ""incident specific to the Trent 900 engine""

611,"(CNN) -- MotoGP is in mourning following the tragic death of Japan's teenage rider Shoya Tomizawa after an accident in the San Marino Moto2 Grand Prix on Sunday. Tomizawa came off his Suter bike on a bend and was struck by the following bikes of Italian Alex de Angelis and Briton Scott Redding -- an impact which saw the 19-year-old thrown down the circuit and into the gravel. Race organizers confirmed that Tomizawa had died in hospital from serious injuries to his skull, chest and abdomen. A statement read: ""Shoya Tomizawa suffered a serious crash and subsequent cranial, thoracic and abdominal trauma. ""He was taken to hospital in Riccione for immediate treatment but succumbed to his injuries. All the MotoGP family wants to express its deepest condolences to his family and friends."" Tomizawa's death was the first in the sport since 24-year-old compatriot Daijiro Kato died in April 2003 at the Japanese MotoGP in Suzuka. Moto2 is the class below MotoGP and the main race followed before news of Tomizawa's death had been confirmed. Honda rider Dani Pedrosa of Spain claimed victory, his fourth of the season and second in a row, after starting from pole position. Compatriot and world championship leader Jorge Lorenzo finished second and world champion Valentino Rossi was third. However, there was an understandably subdued podium ceremony when confirmation of Tomizawa's death became known. ""It feels so strange, there is a big hole inside me. I was so happy and then I was told the news and this big hole opened up inside me,"" the 24-year-old Pedrosa told BBC TV. Rossi, winner of the race for the past two seasons, was visibly moved to tears, saying: ""When it happens like this nothing else really matters.""","MotoGP is in mourning following the tragic death of Japan's Shoya Tomizawa .

612,"(CNN) -- Scientists say they are a step closer to recreating the conditions at the birth of the universe and to understanding life as we know it, after the successful collision of heavy lead ions in a massive machine in Europe. This week, for the first time, ions were smashed together inside the Large Hadron Collider along the French and Swiss border. Until now, only protons had been collided in the experiment. The tiny particles' lightning-fast collision promised to produce temperatures up to 100,000 times hotter than the sun, said Michael Tuts, a professor in experimental high-energy physics at New York's Columbia University and one of hundreds of scientists involved in the project. ""What we're doing is reproducing the conditions that existed at the very early universe, a few millionths of a second after the Big Bang,"" said Tuts, referencing the cosmic explosion that many scientists believe spawned the universe from one minuscule particle. ALICE, an acronym for A Large Ion Collider Experiment, is run through the European Laboratory for Nuclear Research and involves physicists, engineers and technicians from around the world. Many of these scientists will examine the aftereffects of this latest ion collision as they try to step back further to the universe's emergence billions of years ago. The lead ion, Tuts explained, is a lead atom that does not contain electrons -- thus, is more likely reflective of what matter existed in the millionths of a second after the Big Bang. By combining more and more basic elements, scientists hope to better understand how various particles came together to create the modern-day universe and all it contains. ""We hope to understand how we're put together, how these (basic) constituents go on to make protons and neutrons, which in turn go on to make the atoms that you and I are made of,"" Tuts told CNN. Microseconds after the Big Bang, there was a ""hot soup"" of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero, John Harris, professor of physics at Yale University, said last year. Although they have never been directly seen, these particles are theoretically the building blocks of the bigger particles -- protons, neutrons and electrons -- that form the universe as we know it.","Lead ions have collided for the first time inside a massive machine in Europe .

613,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- An Indonesian volcano has killed 240 people since it started erupting in October, officials said Saturday, a day after it spewed more hot ash and sent residents fleeing. More than 390,000 people have been displaced, according to the nation's disaster coordination board. At least 162 people suffered severe burns, the board said on its website. Indonesia's Mount Merapi started erupting on October 26. On Friday, it spewed volcanic material for more than an hour. Merapi, which looms on the horizon north of the major city of Yogyakarta, is on the island of Java. Officials said Thursday the worst may be over, but a danger zone remains within a 20-kilometer (12.2-mile) radius of the volcano. Government experts have kept Merapi's alert level at 4, the highest. President Obama was forced to cut short his visit to Indonesia this week because of the volcano's ash cloud. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called the volcanic eruptions a crisis situation. Over the weekend, he and several ministers visited the area to oversee relief efforts. The volcano has a summit elevation of almost 3,000 meters (10,000 feet). It is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and lies in one of the world's most densely populated areas. About 1,300 people died when the volcano erupted in 1930. Many people continue to live in the shadow of the volcano, raising crops and livestock. The president has announced that residents will receive compensation for livelihoods and animals lost to the eruptions. The government will buy endangered cows on the volcano, Yudhoyono said. Many of those who live on its slopes risked their lives by staying or returning to feed their cows during lulls in the volcanic activity. CNN's Andy Saputra contributed to this report.","At least 162 people suffer severe burns .

614,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Motor vehicle accidents don't just impact the people involved, they also impact the economy, to the tune of just under $100 billion for medical care and injury-related productivity losses in the United States each year, according to a study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday. That includes $3.6 billion annually toward injuries to children. On average, each licensed driver in the United States ponies up about $500 a year toward the total costs, the CDC said. ""Every 10 seconds, someone in the United States is treated in an emergency department for crash-related injuries, and nearly 40,000 people die from these injuries each year. This study highlights the magnitude of the problem of crash-related injuries from a cost perspective, and the numbers are staggering,"" Dr. Grant Baldwin, the director of the CDC's Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said in a press release. According to the study, injuries, both fatal and nonfatal, to people riding in cars and light trucks cost $70 billion a year. Injuries to motorcyclists cost $12 billion. Bicyclists and pedestrians, who are vulnerable against motor vehicles, cost $5 billion and $10 billion a year respectively, the CDC said. The study also found the amount of money that goes toward motorcyclists' and pedestrians' injuries is disproportionate when compared to the number of injuries, likely due to the severity of their injuries. While motorcyclists only account for 6 percent of motor vehicle-related fatalities and injuries, they lead to 12 percent of the costs. And pedestrians, who only comprise 5 percent of motor vehicle-related deaths and injuries, consume 10 percent of the total costs, according to the study. The CDC said several policy initiatives have been proven to cut down on crash injuries and deaths, including graduated driver licensing programs, which allow new teen drivers to get road experience in low-risk situations. The CDC says strong graduated driver licensing laws have been associated with up to 40 percent decreases in crashes among 16-year-old drivers. Other CDC-recommended policies include child safety seat education, seat belt laws and enforcement, sobriety checkpoints, and motorcycle and bicycle helmet laws. The CDC said the study, published in the the journal ""Traffic Injury Prevention,"" used data from 2005, the last year from which relevant data were available from multiple sources.","Motor vehicle crashes lead to about $100 billion a year in U.S. costs, says the CDC .

615,"(CNN) -- The death toll from Pakistan's massive flooding has climbed to 1,639, but the number could rise substantially as flood waters recede and more bodies surface, government officials say. More than 17 million Pakistanis -- about the population of the Netherlands -- have been affected by the monsoon floods that began a month ago. In the past few days, at least 1 million people have been displaced in Pakistan's Sindh province, the United Nations said. Authorities issued evacuation orders after a levee burst. Want to help Pakistan? Impact Your World suggests how . Homeless families stomped through filthy waters as clean water remains a scarce commodity. Hundreds of thousands of victims have acquired transmittable ailments such as acute watery diarrhea, scabies and respiratory infections. The United Nations says more than $1 billion has been given or pledged. On Saturday, the United States announced the deployment of 18 additional helicopters to assist with relief efforts, according to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan. About 15 other U.S. helicopters and three other aircraft have transported 2 million pounds of supplies, the embassy said. But the need for help is greatly outpacing the supply. ""The magnitude of this crisis is reaching levels that are even beyond our initial fears, which were already leaning toward what we thought would be the worst,"" Maurizio Giuliano, a spokesman for the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said Friday. ""The number of those affected and those in need of assistance from us are bound to keep rising. The floods seem determined to outrun our response."" The U.N. also said Friday that it is increasingly concerned about flood-driven malnutrition among children. ""The flooding has surrounded millions of children with contaminated water,"" said Karen Allen, deputy representative of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Pakistan. ""Most have nothing else to drink. We fear the deadly synergy of waterborne diseases, including diarrhea, dehydration and malnutrition."" Acute malnutrition was high in much of Pakistan even before the floods. For instance, 27 percent of children under 5 in Baluchistan province were malnourished, as were 17 percent of children in Punjab, according to the U.N. A hospital in Sindh is overrun with people suffering from waterborne illness; two children share each bed and more are on the floor. A doctor at the hospital said there are ""not enough resources because of huge population ... coming to this hospital."" Remat Chacher, a farmer in Sindh, escaped the flood waters with his wife and two children earlier this month. But then his 3-month-old daughter Benazir got sick. ""She started to get fever and couldn't keep anything down ... lots of belly pain,"" said Ulla, the infant's mom. A few days later, the same symptoms struck the Chachers' son, 2-year-old Wazira. Both children died on the way to the hospital, with Wazira weighing just 8 pounds and Benazir weighing 2 pounds. At least 200 health facilities across the country have been damaged or destroyed, according to the World Health Organization. Flood waters have started to recede across Pakistan, but in the Indus River delta, the potential for more flooding remained high. It is unclear when displaced Pakistanis will be able to return to their homes. But many will have no house to return to. About 1.2 million homes have been destroyed from the flooding.

616,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Volcanic ash spewing from Indonesia's Mount Merapi has forced some airlines to cancel flights out of Jakarta's international airport, airport officials said Wednesday. Cathay Pacific Airways and Qantas Airways had canceled flights at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, airport spokesman Andang Santoso said. Singapore Airlines said it was continuing to fly. Large clouds of gas and dust from Merapi's recent eruptions also have forced some flight cancellations into and out of the Yogyakarta airport. Travelers were asked to check with their airlines for schedule changes. On Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama shortened his visit to the Indonesian capital because of concerns that volcanic ash could ground Air Force One in Jakarta, according to administration officials. Recent eruptions of Merapi, which started on October 26, have killed at least 156 people, officials at Sardjito hospital have said. The eruptions also have displaced an estimated 200,000 people. The 3,000-meter (9,800-foot) Merapi, in Central Java, is famously unpredictable. About 1,300 people died when Merapi erupted in 1930.","Cathay Pacific and Qantas cancels flights at Jakarta's international airport .

617,"(CNN) -- Firefighters in Detroit, Michigan, grappled with 85 fires in a four-hour period Tuesday night, officials said. ""A lot of these fires were due to high winds and downed wires,"" said Karen Dumas, a city spokeswoman. There were no reports of deaths or injuries, she said. ""We had winds from 30-50 mph and have a number of downed power wires,"" said Detroit Fire Commissioner James Mack Jr. ""We are attributing some of the fires to downed power wires which makes more fires with the wind being so strong."" Mack said that between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. the fire department responded to 140 calls for wires down before the evening outbreak. Detroit firefighters received assistance from fire departments in the neighboring towns of Warren, Dearborn and Harper Woods. ""It's a matter of public safety,"" Dumas said. ""We have enough resources to manage our daily demands, but that was an unusual and concentrated number of fires."" There also was at least one report of suspected arson associated with the fires, Mack said. A man in the city's northeast section is being questioned.","The fire department responded to 140 calls for wires down .

618,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor returned home Saturday from a Los Angeles hospital a day after she was rushed there by ambulance for a swollen leg, her husband said. Paramedics initially suspected Gabor suffered from a blood clot in her left leg, but an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center later determined she had an infection, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt said Saturday. The 93-year-old actress spent several weeks at the same hospital after hip replacement surgery in July. She has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge;"" ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""","The 93-year-old actress was released from a hospital Saturday .

619,"(CNN) -- Police are probing an apparent murder-suicide in Erie, Pennsylvania, saying they suspect a father shot dead his wife and two young children before turning the gun on himself. The two parents and children, ages 4 and 7, were found dead in an Erie home around 11 a.m. Saturday, said Erie Police Lt. Tom Eberlein. A bullet also grazed the ear of a 2-year-old in the house, and the toddler was sent to an area hospital, said Eberlein. The child's condition was not immediately known. The names of those killed have not been released; the case remains under investigation. Several neighbors told CNN affiliate WICU that they heard gunshots around 9 a.m. and then again about an hour later. ""They were a happy family, never seen them argue or nothing,"" Olivia Shultz, a neighbor, told WICU. Erie, in western Pennsylvania on the banks of Lake Erie, is about 100 miles from both Buffalo, New York, to the northeast, and Cleveland, Ohio, to the southwest.","NEW: A neighbor says the shooting victims appeared to be 'a happy family'

620,"Minneapolis, Minnesota (CNN) -- For 13-year-old Arrianna Merritt, the words mother and hero go hand in hand. Three years ago Sunday Arrianna watched her mother Kim Dahl drive a school bus loaded with children across the Mississippi River when the bridge began to buckle up and down. Thirteen people were killed in the bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  What Arrianna remembers most was the choice her mother made that day after the bus became tilted upward on a steep incline. ""Either you let us free fall -- or you hold that brake to the ground and you stay where you are.""  Dahl held the brake with her foot until she could reach for the parking brake. Millions of viewers saw the jaw-dropping images of the school bus as it teetered on the edge of a broken stretch of highway, with nothing but a guard rail separating it from a deadly fall.  Arrianna sat in the bus with her brother, 50 other children and eight adults. The bus ""went up, and then it went down,"" Dahl recalls, adding it soon turned into free fall and she was ""hanging on for dear life."" ""I thought 'this is it,' I'm not getting out, and I'm going to die."" The new 35W bridge: Is it the safest in America? With the parking brake on, Dahl kept the bus in place while everyone made it out the rear emergency door safely. Arrianna, 10 at the time, and her then-5-year-old brother David, were the last ones and had refused to get off with the others. ""We didn't want to leave our mom,"" David, now 8, remembers. ""I'm like 'get your butts off the bus,'"" Dahl said. They eventually did. Dahl says she managed to break free herself after a jolt on the bridge seemed to release her seatbelt, which had been stuck. Since that day, those on the bridge and their loved ones have never been the same.  This particular mother-daughter pair say they've always had a tight bond but Arrianna says she and her mother have grown even closer since their ordeal. ""We've always been close, but I think after the accident we got closer because we shared the same experience and we know what its like,"" Arrianna said. The physical reminders of that day often overshadow the emotional ones. ""It does hurt to see my mom in pain because she cant do the things that she used to love to do."" Dahl broke her back in the fall and that's been the primary cause of complications since. ""It's like a new me that I'm living with,"" Dahl said. ""It's almost like your freedom is taken away... I can't go grocery shopping by myself because I can't lift the milk up and put it in the cart."" ""My kids and my husband -- I couldn't ask for a better family,"" Dahl said. ""I mean my kids step up and do a lot of the work that I can't do or help me do things that I can't do. They're pretty good about saying 'yea.'"" ""I don't know if life will ever be normal like it was before July of '07 and prior, but we've made the best for it,"" said Dave Dahl. ""We've adjusted our lives, we've changed our lifestyles. But we've just got to be positive."" Dave Dahl reminds himself that things could have been worse. ""Our family unit here in this house is five people,"" he says. ""Within an instant it could have been two."" Arrianna in particular has taken on a number of duties, like cleaning the bathrooms and doing the laundry, that she says has taught her how to be ""a grown-up."" ""Most of the time when my mom is in the hospital or getting surgeries, I have to step in and be the surrogate mother to my younger siblings,"" Arrianna explains. The family also includes another daughter, Brianna, age 11. ""And my dad is working a lot of the time so he kind of doesn't have much time."" ""It kind of teaches me to grow up some and how to be a grownup and what it's like."" She adds it can get difficult once in awhile, but these days she simply reminds herself who she's doing it for. ""Now I kind of understand why I have to stand in and why sometimes I have to be the adult."" Kim Dahl deals with PTSD, as well, and still sees a therapist twice a month. And while Arrianna no longer has therapy sessions of her own, occasionally she still struggles.  Kim Dahl is among 122 victims and their families who've filed suit against URS Corp., an engineering and construction firm hired by Minnesota DOT to conduct engineering analysis on the bridge before it collapsed. A federal investigative report blamed the collapse on support plates that were too thin, and increased weight on the bridge from construction equipment.  The amount of punitive damages plaintiffs are seeking against URS is ""hard to say,"" said Dahl's attorney Bill Harper, who estimated it could be as much as $100 million.  ""URS was hired by the state to make sure the integrity of the bridge was safe for the public,"" Harper said Wednesday. ""They did not do what they promised to do -- and as a result -- that bridge collapsed.""  Attorneys for URS said the company's ""work was unrelated to the causes of the bridge collapse. ... URS did not design the bridge, was never asked to verify the bridge's original design, and did not know the bridge's original design was defective.""  Hennepin County District Judge Deborah Hedlund is expected to rule on punitive damages by mid-October.  Painful reminders . On Tuesday Kim Dahl and Arrianna visited the site of the collapse -- where the new I-35 West bridge stands. The sound of a jackhammer in the distance is enough to remind Arrianna of the construction noise taking place on the bridge at the time of the accident. It brings her to tears. Thankfully mom is nearby. ""She is kind of like my counselor because she listens,"" Arrianna said. She no longer needs a therapist, but it's these rare moments when mom comes in handy. And occasionally, Arrianna says, their roles are reversed. She recalls hearing her mother sometimes say things about how life would be easier if none of this had ever happened. Arrianna's advice? ""You need to move on, and you need to be strong and live your life to the fullest."" Those are words the family is living by.   Kim Dahl has had to give up what her husband Dave Dahl would call the ""wilder motor sports,"" and the five of them have taken on a new hobby: road trips. Kim Dahl says she'll never be able to drive a bus again -- something she misses more than anything. She had the same bus routes for years and knew the kids and their parents well. But the family camper may be the next best thing. So far, they've made it as far as Florida to the east and Colorado to the west. ""My mom could never afford it...we never went anywhere,"" Kim Dahl recalls of her childhood. ""And we went on [our] first trip and it was just awesome. To learn stuff and to see stuff was just amazing."" As Dave Dahl describes it, there's ""no stress, there's no itinerary, nothing, we just go."" ""Wherever we get is where we get,"" he adds. ""We kind of have a goal of where we like to be in the end."" Given the path Kim Dahl and her loved ones have traveled since 2007, that phrase could be the family motto too.","Mom helped save 52 kids, eight adults after '07 Minneapolis bridge collapse .

621,"Bowie, Maryland (CNN) -- President Barack Obama interrupted a campaign speech twice on Thursday to seek help for people in the audience who collapsed. ""I think we might have had somebody faint down here, so if we got the paramedics,"" Obama said about halfway through his remarks under bright afternoon sunshine at Bowie State University. ""They'll be all right. Just make sure you give them some space. And if somebody has a bottle of water, you might want to give it to them."" A few minutes later, near the end of his remarks, Obama again noted a member of the crowd in distress. ""Someone up here got a little hot. Let 'em sit down. Let 'em sit down,"" he said to the audience, asking if there was a bottle of water on stage for the stricken person. ""Remember, next time you come out here, eat something and drink something"" beforehand, Obama added. The president was stumping for Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is seeking re-election. Prince George's County medical personnel said they responded to a number of sick cases at the university on Thursday. Fire Department spokesman Mark Brady said that between 1:45 and 2 p.m., about an hour before Obama's speech, ambulance crews stationed at the campus as part of the White House event responded to reports of people ""fainting, getting dizzy, and otherwise passing out."" Prince George's County Fire Department officials later told CNN they were treating at least two dozen people at the university for fainting and dehydration. Brady said that while the temperatures were mild, ""in that rally area, the sun is extremely hot."" ""In addition, that rally area was extremely crowded and compacted,"" he said. ""You had the rally people shoulder to shoulder, if not closer, and standing for an extended period of time and waiting for the rally to start. A lot of these people that we treated today were senior citizens, so they're probably not accustomed to this type of environment, and those were the people that we found that experienced the fainting, the dizziness issues."" Also, a heckler was heard shouting ""You're a liar!"" early in Obama's remarks. The man was shouted down by others in the crowd, and it was unclear whether the president heard him. CNN's Tom Cohen and Vito Maggiolo contributed to this story.","NEW: Fire official says most of the ill were senior citizens .

622,"(CNN) -- Cargill Meat Solutions Corp. has recalled about 8,500 pounds of ground beef that may be contaminated with E. coli, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Saturday. The move came after three people, two in Maine and one in New York, were identified as becoming ill from a strain of E. coli, the government said. None of the three required hospitalization, said Cargill Inc. spokesman Mike Martin. ""It was a relief it wasn't more serious,"" he told CNN. The USDA says it believes certain BJ's Wholesale Club stores in Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Virginia received the products. The recalled ground beef was shipped June 11 to distribution centers, where it was repackaged into consumer-size packages and sold under different retail brand names. The USDA did not identify the brands. The recalled beef bears the USDA establishment number ""EST. 9400,"" a product code of ""W69032"" and a ""use/freeze by"" date of July 1. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Services, which said it became aware of the problem on August 5, ""determined that there is an association between the ground beef products subject to recall and the cluster of illnesses in the states of Maine and New York."" Saturday's statement identified the strain as E. coli 026, which can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration and, in severe cases, kidney failure. The government ""strongly encourages consumers to check their freezers and immediately discard any product subject to this recall."" The government lists the recall as Class 1, meaning ""there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death."" Consumers with questions regarding the recall should contact the Cargill consumer line at (877) 788-4953. Martin said Cargill is working with the USDA to learn what happened. ""We decided to take swift action to do the right thing,"" he said of the recall.","NEW: None of those who became ill required hospitalization .

623,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Amid the overwhelming flood disaster in Pakistan, the world has ""no choice but to be optimistic and to have hope"" that things can improve there, actress and humanitarian Angelina Jolie told CNN Wednesday. Jolie is in the country as the personal envoy of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres. She spoke to CNN from Islamabad after touring flood-hit areas of Pakistan, including the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. She described meeting a couple in their 70s who live on a pension and who watched as floodwater destroyed the family home they had worked hard to build. ""The woman is so embarrassed with her situation, and the man spoke of the fact that he never felt in his lifetime he is ever going to be able to recuperate what he's lost -- that he would never again have nice things, he would never have a nice bed, a nice house,"" Jolie told CNN. ""They lived in this place since 1972 and raised their children and their grandchildren there. And in a moment, a few hours, it was completely gone."" She said the area the couple lived in is now covered in mud and dirt, with feces in the fly-covered river nearby, all because of the floods. ""It doesn't have the dignity that they deserve to live in -- anybody deserves to live in,"" Jolie said. The couple lives in the village of Mohib Banda, where some 70 percent of the homes were destroyed or badly damaged by the swirling floodwater, according to the UNHCR. The death toll in the country has climbed to 1,738, the Pakistan Disaster Authority said over the weekend. Almost 21 million people have been affected by the flooding, Valerie Amos, the new U.N. emergency relief coordinator, said Monday. Water-borne illnesses from contaminated floodwaters have erupted nationwide. At least 1 million Pakistanis have crippling diarrhea or respiratory infections, and about 65,000 cases of malaria have been reported. Jolie's visit is intended to highlight the suffering of the millions of flood victims and the need for continuing aid for the displaced. One reason relatively few people have paid attention to the suffering in Pakistan, Jolie said, may be disaster fatigue. She pointed out Pakistan has endured several disasters in recent years, including an earthquake in 2005 that killed more than 70,000 people. ""We tend to focus on one issue at a time, because that seems to be what people can absorb and care for,"" she said. She added that it's difficult to convey the story of the disaster in Pakistan, and that even she had no idea what she would face. ""When I was standing in one of the houses, it was nine feet tall, the water. It was not a flood that made everything wet for a (while). It washed away children right out of their parents' hands. It destroyed lives."" Jolie said she would want people to remember this: ""They are people. They are family, and lovely, lovely, hard-working people and beautiful children, and they deserve dignity and assistance, and we have to treat them with respect and try to preserve what we can of their livelihood and their future."" The Pakistani people are resilient and will move on, Jolie said, but she urged international support to help them do that. ""I think we have no choice but to be optimistic and to have hope,"" she said. ""I think without that, we are just lost, and things deteriorate.""","Jolie is in Pakistan as the envoy to the U.N. high commissioner for refugees .

624,"(CNN) -- The U.S. response to the increasing natural disaster in Pakistan is, like so much else when it comes to American relations with that country, too little and too tentative. Epic flooding now hitting Pakistan is an unfolding humanitarian crisis on the scale of its 2005 earthquake, which claimed some 75,000 lives, or the 2004 Asian tsunami, in which more than 200,000 people died. And because of the gradual nature of flooding, as opposed to the sudden impact of an earthquake, the devastation over time could overwhelm those earlier crises. One in nine Pakistanis -- some 20 million people -- are already homeless, lacking food or medicine. Health officials warn that a cholera epidemic is likely, with 3½ million children now at risk. Despite the cataclysmic scale of this disaster, the Obama administration is not responding with the same direct, comprehensive and large-scale effort that the Bush administration undertook in response to the 2005 Pakistani earthquake and the 2004 Asian tsunami. This current approach of primarily relying on the Pakistani government and local aid groups will not work -- either in terms of meeting the scale of the crisis or swaying Pakistani public opinion toward the United States. American aid to the flood victims is a clear humanitarian imperative. Some have argued that it is also in the national security interest of the United States to win friends and stabilize the country. This is of particular concern since, according to my contacts in Pakistan and reports in South Asia media, radical Islamist groups allied to al Qaeda are on the front lines in providing direct aid to the flood victims. Jamaat-ud-Dawa, linked to the terrorists who carried out the 2008 attack in Mumbai, India, has already reportedly established 13 relief camps, with some 2,000 members providing help. Pakistan, the only nuclear-armed Muslim majority country, is the home base for both the Taliban and al Qaeda. Its population faces growing radicalization; the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Adm. Mike Mullen, has called it the most important country to the future of Islamist extremism. The United States thus far is donating $76 million in assistance, only a portion of which is being provided directly by the U.S. military. But the $76 million is dwarfed by the massive humanitarian assistance -- hundreds of millions -- the U.S. military brought directly to victims of the 2005 earthquake and the 2004 tsunami -- delivered via aircraft carriers, hospital ships and thousands of American troops. U.S. military helicopters flew some 6,000 relief operations to Pakistani earthquake victims alone. For both the 2005 earthquake and the tsunami, the U.S. military worked closely with local governments, but did not leave it primarily up to them to deliver the aid. Large-scale humanitarian assistance can have a dramatic favorable influence on public opinion. The nonprofit organization I lead provided empirical proof of this in conducting the first public opinion surveys of Indonesia after the tsunami and Pakistan after the 2005 earthquake, as well as follow-up polls. After the tsunami struck Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country, on December 26, 2004, the United States led an extraordinary international relief effort of on-the-ground, people-to-people aid. It was broadcast nonstop on local Indonesian television and had a clear American ""brand."" Afterward, public opinion among Indonesians dramatically swung toward the United States, with 65 percent of Indonesians expressing a favorable opinion as a direct result of American aid. Mullen called the shift in Indonesian public opinion toward America ""one of the defining moments of this new century."" Similarly, after the devastating earthquake hit Pakistan in 2005, the United States stepped in with another intensive relief effort -- again widely reported in local media and clearly identified as American aid. Afterward, our surveys found that 79 percent of self-identified Osama Bin Laden supporters (78 percent of all Pakistanis) thought well of the United States because of its humanitarian mission. Among all Pakistanis, the U.S. government was more popular than al Qaeda, the Taliban, or any Pakistani Islamist radical group -- even among Pakistanis who thought favorably of these groups. Indeed, the number of Pakistanis who voiced a favorable opinion of the United States doubled from 23 percent six months before the earthquake to 46 percent one month after American aid began. Yet our research shows that in the case of both the tsunami and Pakistani earthquake, public opinion changed only because the American military delivered the aid directly, in a comprehensive campaign cooperative with, but not dependent on, local governments or nonprofit groups. Whether from donor fatigue or simply a lack of vision, the United States is not mobilizing a similar effort now. In addition, the Pakistani government's response to the crisis has been ineffective at best. Distrust of Pakistan's political leaders is spreading as rapidly as the floodwaters. The United States has the same opportunity as the radical Islamists to fill the void. It can help the victims of one of the largest natural disasters we have recently seen. The United States can also win over Pakistanis, in the key country in the battle against extremism. But only if the administration steps up and deploys the same level of military resources as with the 2004 tsunami and the 2005 Pakistani earthquake can we succeed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ken Ballen.","Ken Ballen says Pakistan floods are crisis that could rival 2005 earthquake, Asian tsunami .

625,"(CNN) -- Nearly 35 years after a Texas judge sentenced him to death, Ronald Chambers was found dead Monday morning on the floor of his cell. Guards found Chambers, 55, unresponsive around 6:30 a.m. while doing their rounds, Dallas County Sheriff Spokeswoman Kim Leach said. He was then transported to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, where he was pronounced dead. The Dallas County medical examiner's office said it would take six to 12 weeks before Chambers' cause of death could be definitively determined. But Leach said Chambers had many health complications when he came last year to the Dallas County jail. Chambers was 19 when he and Clarence Ray Williams kidnapped Mike McMahon and his date from the parking lot of a Dallas nightclub, then ordered them down the embankment of the Trinity River, according to the Texas Attorney General's Office. The two men robbed the couple and, after shooting at them, left them for dead. The female survivor, Deia Sutton, testified that she and her boyfriend survived the first attack, but Chambers went back and killed McMahan by repeatedly hitting him over the head with the barrel of a shotgun. On December 18, 1975, a jury found Chambers guilty of capital murder and a judge subsequently put him on the state's death row. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals twice set aside his conviction -- once because he wasn't read his Miranda rights after being interviewed by a state psychiatrist -- but both times he was retried and convicted again. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court again granted Chambers a stay of execution, amid questions about the instructions given to the jury, the Dallas Observer reported. The case was sent back to Texas and a fourth sentencing trial was set for spring 2011, according to published reports. While numerous reports called Chambers the ""Dean of Death Row,"" because of the various legal maneuverings he didn't have a death sentence the entire time he was behind bars, including at the time of his death.  Excell White, who killed four people in 1974 and wasn't executed until 1999, spent more time -- 8,854 days -- on death row before being put to death than any other Texas convict. Texas, which has executed more prisoners since 1976 than any other state, pays $86.08 to execute a death row inmate, or the cost of drugs used in a lethal injection, the state's Division of Criminal Justice reports. That compares to the $17,338, on average, that it costs to jail a Texas inmate for 12 months, according to 2009 data from the National Institute of Corrections, which is below the national yearly average of $28,689.","Ronald Chambers was found on the floor of his cell and later pronounced dead .

626,"(CNN) -- Thirty-four vehicles, including four semi-trailer trucks, were involved in a chain-reaction pile-up Monday morning in Colorado that temporarily shut down a major highway and sent 12 people to area hospitals, state police said. The massive accident occurred on Interstate 25 northbound in Larkspur, about 40 miles south of Denver and 30 miles north of Colorado Springs, Colorado, State Patrol Trooper Nate Reid told CNN. None of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening, according to Reid. He added that road conditions were icy and wet at the time of the accident. Motorist Brad Simpson told CNN affiliate KOAA, ""It was just really bad snow, it was something where a lot of people were driving way too fast for the conditions."" Authorities used school buses to move people who were not injured but were stuck on the highway. They were taken to a shelter at the New Covenant Church in Larkspur, authorities told CNN affiliate KUSA. The accident prompted police to close the highway northbound. Several CNN affiliates, including KMGH and KWGN, reported that one lane reopened around noon and traffic was moving through all lanes by 12:45 p.m. -- about four hours after the accident happened. CNN's Frances Causey contributed to this report.","34 vehicles, including 4 semi-trailer trucks, were in a huge pile-up Monday morning .

627,"(CNN) -- While winter's start remains more than a month away, much of Minnesota and Wisconsin were under a winter storm warning Saturday, with some areas seeing almost a foot of snow. As early as 10:30 a.m., 11 inches of snow had fallen in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, the National Weather Service reported. Other Minnesota communities had seen 10 inches by midday, including New Hope, Amboy, Mankato and Montgomery, while parts of Minneapolis were blanketed by at least nine inches of snow. In some areas, an inch of snow was falling an hour. ""Even though we get this every single year, for whatever reason, the first snow of the year appears to make everyone forget how to drive in snow,"" Drew Gordon, of Eagan, Minnesota, told CNN Radio. ""So it's always a huge, huge mess."" Shortly after 5 p.m., the Minnesota State Patrol reported on its Twitter page that officers had responded to at least 401 crashes on Saturday, 45 of them with injuries. The agency warned drivers that conditions could worsen in the evening, as roads turned icy. The storm also affected air travel, with dozens of flights to and from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport delayed or canceled. The snow was accompanied by sustained winds blowing as high as 25 mph. The National Weather Service's warning extends through noon Sunday, with just under a foot of snow predicted in the heaviest hit areas, including Minneapolis and St. Paul. The storm's weekend timing muted its impact on traffic and the economy. Still, as the first big snow since last spring, it managed to jolt even Minnesota residents familiar with wintry weather. ""The reality hits when you need to dig out the shovels, and the snowsuits and the boots,"" said Lisa Saline of Bloomington told CNN Radio. ""I'm glad I don't have kids in strollers anymore, and I can hand them a shovel and have them go do the driveway."" The snow was forecast to continue into Sunday, and more might come before long, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures were forecast to be below freezing much of next week, with a 30 percent chance of additional snow on Tuesday. Minnesota and Wisconsin aren't the only U.S. locales experiencing wintry weather in mid-November. ""Near blizzard conditions"" are forecast for Wyoming and parts of western Nebraska starting as early as Monday night, with persistent snow combining with sustained winds as high as 45 mph and gusts up to 60 mph. While the National Weather Service is predicting a break Thursday, another winter storm could barrel through that region next weekend.","NEW: Minnesota State Patrol has responded to 401 accidents, 45 with injuries .

628,"(CNN) -- A communication breakdown has left people in anxious limbo around the globe with those outside Haiti not knowing whether loved ones there survived a major earthquake, and those in Haiti unable to get word out that they're safe. With few phone calls going through in the Caribbean nation in the aftermath of Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude quake, people were driven to texting, social networking sites and other online communication. Thousands of people reached out through CNN's iReport Web page, posting pictures of missing loved ones and asking anyone with information to contact them. Pleas for help filled page after page on iReports, including: . • Johanna Neyra, who was trying to track down her cousin and his wife, Luis and Heidy Carazas. Luis Carazas works for the Archdiocese of Port-au-Prince, in the Haitian capital. ""His family is very concerned in Peru,"" said Neyra, who waited for word of their fate, knowing the official Vatican newspaper had reported that Joseph Serge Miot, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Port-au-Prince, had died in the earthquake. • Naeemah Carre of Garden City, New York, reported no success in trying to raise her brother and six other relatives via e-mail and Facebook. • New York City resident Marie Aline Sillice had not heard from her father, Frangel Victor Sillice, or her cousin Yvon Consean, who were to have been traveling outside the Haitian capital on Tuesday. • Chico and Kathleen Boyer waited in Brooklyn, New York, to hear from daughter Maureen, who moved to Haiti two weeks ago. A number of aunts and cousins also were missing. Maureen Boyer posted to her Twitter account late Tuesday afternoon, but had not been heard from since. ""When the earthquake hit, she may have been home already or on the road close to home,"" Kathleen Boyer said in her iReport. ""We can't get through to the consulate to report her as a missing U.S. citizen."" • Renee Guercia of Muttontown, New York, waited for word about her 71-year-old father, Joseph, who was in Port-au-Prince on business when the quake hit. Joseph Guercia was meeting with an associate, John Scarborough, on the fifth floor of the Hotel Montana when the shaking began. ""They were having a conversation when the earthquake hit and the roof caved in,"" Renee Guercia said. ""John called out for my dad and there was no response."" Scarborough -- knocked unconscious -- was later rescued from the rubble of the hotel and airlifted to Miami, Guercia said. The Red Cross, as part of its relief effort, has set up a Web page to assist people who have lost contact with someone in Haiti. More than 1,000 names were on the list early Thursday. Impact Your World: How you can help . In Port-au-Prince, residents reached out to CNN reporters, pressing bits of paper into their hands with personal information, in the hope that television could tell of their survival after phone lines had failed them. ""It just rings, but nobody answers and we have no communication right now in Haiti,"" Jean Desroches told CNN's John Zarrella in the Little Haiti neighborhood in Miami, Florida. ""It's worse not knowing. That is my problem right now."" CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.","Communication breakdown in Haiti leaves people around world anxious over fate of loved ones .

629,"(CNN) -- Despite the recent recall of potentially contaminated Romaine, lettuce lovers don't have to nix key ingredients from their BLTs or face lifeless, leafless salads -- they just need to go to seed. Food-borne illness has been tied to E. coli 0145 found in commercially-grown lettuce sold to wholesalers, food service outlets and some in-store salad bars and delis. Lettuce E. coli outbreak spreads to fourth state . Not only can at-home growers skip this risk -- they'll also save money, enjoy a nearly endless variety of organic and heirloom options and have fresh salads at their fingertips all year around -- even without an outdoor garden. Restaurants assure customers lettuce is safe amid recall . Supplies you need: . Seeds . Lettuce grows in several major formats: loose leaf (like Lolla Rossa and Black Seeded Simpson), crisphead (Iceberg and Great Lakes), butterhead (Bibb and Buttercrunch), Cos (also called Romaine) and stem (mostly used in Chinese cooking). For small container gardens and windowboxes, loose leaf is a solid bet, as it grows quickly and doesn't need to establish deep roots. Most hardware, garden and variety stores carry a range of popular seed varieties -- often for $1 or less -- but adventurous gardeners may wish to explore colorful, flavor-packed heirloom and certified organic single-seed packets and blends from online retailers. The Seed Savers Exchange and D. Landreth stock dozens, from blazing Mascara to deep, dark Red Velvet. Containers . Just about any will do, from store bought terracotta pots and plastic window boxes to take-out containers, foil pie pans, halved two-liter bottles and emptied-out plastic clamshells from the supermarket. The vessel just needs to be food-safe, several inches deep and perforated at the bottom to allow drainage. Starting head lettuce in peat pots inside containers allows the option for transplant into a larger garden space -- or even sharing the bounty with friends. Picture yourself: Cool gardens . Soil . If it's going into the food, it's going into you. If possible, opt for chemical-free or organic potting soil -- increasingly available at major hardware stores and home centers. Lighting . Lightly shaded outdoor areas are ideal, as tender young leaves are susceptible to burning in bright sunlight, but windowboxes and kitchen counters can also produce surprisingly robust crops. If natural light isn't available, cool white bulbs and fluorescent lights can successfully stimulate vegetative growth. The seedlings need about 12 hours of light a day, and gardeners may need to adjust the distance from bulb to soil to figure out what works best in their home. You will also need a spray bottle and some plastic wrap. Instructions: . Place at least 2 inches of moist, lightly-packed potting soil into a container with drainage holes. Sprinkle a sparse layer of seeds on top of the soil and follow that with a very light dusting of soil. Mist the soil with a few pumps from a water bottle, lightly cover the container with plastic wrap and place in a warm, bright spot. The seedlings should germinate in about five days. Once they have, remove the plastic wrap and keep the container in the light for around 12 hours a day. Keep the soil moist with the spray bottle or gentle watering from a can or cup. Make sure the soil is draining and not pooling at the bottom of the container. Most crops will be ready to harvest and enjoy within three to four weeks for leaf varieties, and longer for more robust heads. Just snip leaves directly into a colander, rinse and enjoy the fruits -- and vegetables -- of your labor.","Potentially contaminated Romaine lettuce recalled after E. coli outbreak .

630,"(CNN) -- Cholera has arrived in the Dominican Republic, and so have fear and worry. The bacterial intestinal disease has already killed more than 1,100 people in neighboring Haiti and hospitalized more than 18,000 others. Dominican officials said Tuesday the first case has been detected in their nation -- a 32-year-old Haitian construction worker who returned Friday to the Dominican Republic from a visit to his homeland. Although the lone reported case is the result of a migrant bringing the disease into the country and is not related to local water or food contamination, many Dominicans are still worried. ""Yes, yes. Of course,"" said Yehenny Rodriguez, a private security guard who lives in Santo Domingo, the nation's capital. ""There's much worry in the country. This is a strong disease that people get easily. ""Everybody's talking about it."" Asked if people are concerned, Dominican physician Martin Madera had a succinct and emphatic answer: ""Indisputably, yes."" Officials in the Dominican Republic, which already has a strained public health system, have issued a maximum health alert. The disease, which can cause deadly diarrhea and vomiting, is contracted by ingesting contaminated food or water. Dominicans are being urged to wash their hands often and to be careful about what they eat and drink. All forms of media -- television, radio, newspapers, social networks -- are being employed to get the word out, said Madera. ""The most important thing is that the population be advised,"" Madera said. Rodriguez said Wednesday he is taking that advice seriously -- washing his hands often and not eating any food that wasn't prepared at home, especially street food. Many others are following the same practice, he said. The World Health Organization rates the Dominican Republic's health system as the 51st most efficient among 191 countries. That ranking places it in a lower position than the United Kingdom (No. 18) and the United States (No. 37), but higher than South Korea (No. 58) and Mexico (No. 61). Madera, who spent two weeks treating patients in Haiti after January's deadly earthquake, is confident that the Dominican health system can handle an outbreak -- up to a certain point. ""We have sufficient medicine and medical institutions that can handle cases that may come up -- for now,"" he said Wednesday. And Dominican authorities, he said, are taking a proactive approach. Efforts are being made to investigate passengers who were on the same bus in which the ill Haitian traveled to the Dominican Republic last week. Also, he said, all reported cases of diarrhea are being investigated. ""Haitians with diarrhea get greater interest,"" Madera said. The Dominican Republic Ministry of Public Health is receiving help in contingency planning and implementation from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Todd Haskell, spokesman for the USAID office in Santo Domingo. The CDC also is assisting the public health ministry in establishing laboratory testing for cholera, Haskell said in an e-mail. Both agencies started offering their assistance October 22, the spokesman said. Despite Madera's confidence that the Dominican Republic can handle an outbreak, he said, ""it can reach a point where it can overtake a nation's capacity to treat it."" Should that occur, he said, a public state of emergency would be declared and private physicians and health institutions would be called upon to join the battle. For now, he said, the situation is under control. The ill patient, identified as Wilmo Louwes, was hospitalized and immediately isolated in the town of Higuey, near the eastern resort city of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. No firm numbers exist for how many Haitians and Haitian-descended Dominicans live and work in the Dominican Republic. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights placed the number in 1999 as 500,000 to 700,000. Human Rights Watch reported in 2001 that the head of the Dominican army estimated there were about 1 million Haitians in the Dominican Republic. The Haitian embassy in the Dominican Republic gave a similar figure that year. A widespread cholera outbreak could prove devastating for the Dominican Republic if tourists decide to stay away, because the Caribbean island nation relies heavily on tourism. In 2004, for example, the nation of 9 million inhabitants had 4.2 million tourists, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Tourism reported. Of those tourists, more than 4.2 million came by air and more than 455,000 were cruise ship passengers. The services sector of the economy, which includes tourism, employs about 64 percent of the workforce and contributes 55 percent of the gross domestic product, the measure of the nation's services and products.","NEW: USAID and the CDC are offering help, a U.S. spokesman says .

633,"(CNN) -- For 25 agonizing minutes, journalist Norm Beaman did not know whether his wife had perished in wild fires sweeping southern Australia, after he lost mobile phone contact following an explosion and a scream. Firefighters battle a blaze in Labertouche, about 125 kilometers west of Melbourne. Beaman, a veteran reporter for Channel 7 news, was racing home to his property on Mount Disappointment, north of Melbourne, talking to his wife, Annie, as she tried to defend their home from the fires that have left dozens dead. ""She was being stoic, putting up a fight, but when the hay and machinery shed next to our house exploded, she frantically screamed: 'I'm jumping in the dam,' and that was the last I heard of her for 25 minutes,"" he told CNN. Beaman, held back at a roadblock, argued with police to be let through to try to find Annie, but they refused -- eventually dispatching an officer to investigate.  Watch Beaman describe his anguish ». Annie, meanwhile, had been found by neighbors who took her to shelter in the smoldering ruins of another property -- only to face a return of the flames. ""She and some of the neighbors on top of this mountain huddled together in a burnt-out paddock with blankets over their heads and let the fire... and it curled back over them but they escaped."" Beaman said he eventually made it through to his home after persuading officers manning the roadblock to turn a blind eye. ""I eventually pleaded on humanitarian grounds in fairly direct terms with a policeman and asked him to turn his back for 30 seconds and he did and I got through,"" he said. ""A lot of my neighbours have lost everything, but miraculously, my house is still standing and it's now got bodies sleeping on every square inch.""  Photos: Bushfires leave path of destruction » . Beaman said his 22-year-old son Cameron, a news cameraman, was also fearing the worst for his mother as he was dispatched to film the area from the air and was so overcome with emotion he had to be taken off the job.  Watch survivor describe fire ""like a 747"" » . ""He couldn't stand the thought of his mother perishing while he filmed and he had to be dropped off out of the chopper and another cameraman take over."" Beaman was among the survivors of Australia's raging wildfires recounting their harrowing tales. The death toll continued to rise as rescue workers discovered more bodies. Some victims died in cars while trying to flee the flames. Others had stayed put inside houses that were burned to their shells. One man's car caught on fire as he fled the town of Kinglake. ""Both of us had to get out -- get into the car -- just took off into the smoke,"" said one man. ""There's flames coming inside the car."" ""It was terrifying,"" said a woman. ""This was not ordinary. It was an absolute inferno."" ""I lost two kids, mate,"" a grieving father said. ""Nothing will bring them back."" ""I've heard of sad stories of flames going over cars and maybe one person surviving,"" Dr. John Coleridge of Victoria's Alfred Hospital told reporters on Sunday. ""I suspect today they will find lots of cars with people who haven't survived."" Hospital officials treating burn victims said the wounds were the worst they have seen since the terrorist bombings in the Indonesian island of Bali in 2002. Northern Australia, on the other hand, is grappling with a much different problem.

634,"(CNN) -- Nearly 700 people in a small town within Lagos, Nigeria, will be moved to a relief camp due to heavy flooding that has plagued the region since September, according to a state governor. Babatunde Raji Fashola made the announcement Monday while on a tour of flood-impacted areas. In all, 681 people from the town of Ajegunle will be relocated to camps specially built for relief efforts, he said. The flooding began last month when the Ogun River rose above its banks after the opening of a dam. No casualties have been reported. While speaking to affected residents, Fashola emphasized that the area is in a flood plain and that people must be ready to move. He said that the government alone can't solve the problem and they need help from everyone in the area to get through the flooding and limit the damage, asking residents to refrain from using flood-stricken roads. ""We have to wait for this water to subside,"" Fashola said. ""Nature will take its course, but what we can do as a people is work together to mitigate the advanced consequences."" The commissioners for Special Duties, Health and Environment will work together with emergency management officials to relocate the displaced residents, Fashola said.","The flooding began last month in the Lagos region .

635,"(CNN) -- Seven NATO troops died after attacks in Afghanistan on Sunday, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said. Five troops died following an insurgent attack in eastern Afghanistan, ISAF said, though it did not provide details about the attack. Another ISAF service member died following an improvised explosive device attack in southern Afghanistan, ISAF said Sunday, after earlier announcing the death of another servicemember in an IED attack in the southern part of the country. It was not clear whether those two troops died as a result of the same attack. Sunday marked the deadliest day for NATO forces in Afghanistan since October 14, when 7 NATO troops were killed. There have been 34 coalition casualties in Afghanistan so far this month, according to a CNN count. ISAF did not disclose the identifies of the service members killed, citing its policy of deferring casualty identification procedures to relevant national authorities. But the British defense ministry said in a statement Sunday that one of its soldiers died Sunday in southern Afghanistan. The soldier was assigned to 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment and was serving as part of Combined Force Nad'e Ali (South), according to the statement. The soldier died in an improvised explosive device attack in the southern Nad'e Ali area of Helmand Province. The soldier was part of a security patrol, Task Force Helmand spokesman Lt. Col. David Eastman said in a statement. Next of kin have been informed, Britain's Ministry of Defence said.","Troops killed in insurgent attacks, NATO says .

636,"(CNN) -- Few people can forget the moment quake victim Anna Zizi, 69, was dragged from the rubble, singing at the top of her voice, her face caked in dirt and debris. Amidst the heartache and anguish brought by the devastating earthquake, music has proved a source of comfort for Haitians at home and abroad. Those living in France, in particular, say the sounds of kompa help bring their hearts closer to home and soothe their souls. ""For Haitian people, kompa music is like a cure. It helps us to forget stress and the bad times in life,"" said Original H, a popular Haitian kompa group in Paris, in a statement emailed to CNN. ""Even in the saddest moments Haitian people always sing. Haitian people always laugh. Their hearts hurt, but they really want to continue to live,"" said Michel Marchand, presenter of ""Kompa Boulevard,"" a program on France-based Radio Espace FM. Kompa musician Mikael Guirand of the celebrated band Carimi felt the power of his music first-hand. Guirand was in a meeting in the Digicel tower in Port-au-Prince, the country's tallest building, when the quake struck. He made it out unharmed, but his family's home and his father's business were both destroyed. Despite the overwhelming despair that followed, Guirand told CNN that devastated fans threw their arms around him in the streets, overjoyed to see musicians like him had survived. ""To have people with no home crying to see that we made it alive is insane,"" Guirand said. ""That shows how highly they value the music...it gives them hope."" In France, kompa musicians are now rallying for their homeland and performing in charity concerts. ""Since the tragedy we've participated in several events and projects to raise funds including 'A Gesture for Haiti',"" said Original H. That event brought together leading French artists, including renowned singer Charles Aznavour, to produce a special song and music video. ""We have all family and friends in Haiti, and most of us have lost someone. It is an unforgettable disaster and sometimes we feel helpless for our nation,"" Original H told CNN. Radio Espace and KompaParis.com, a Web site dedicated to kompa, are now helping lead the way organizing and promoting several festivals in France. In the days after the earthquake both groups also used their sites and broadcasts to help Haitians in France find family back home. The popularity of kompa music in France bodes well for the success of these upcoming events. Radio host Marchand thinks one of the key reasons is because of kompa's exuberant, live performances. ""Kompa is very popular in France,"" he said. ""It's because Haitian people play live music, not just in a studio, or to sell it on a shelf."" Kompa music is considered an integral part of Haitian culture, first emerging on the Caribbean island about 60 years ago, distinguishing itself from the Dominican Republic's brand of merengue, both in spelling and in style. The Haitian meringue is nearly identical to the Dominican merengue but it is a slower tempo and is usually performed in a minor key. Fans describe it as a jazz derivative with pulsing beats, twisting rhythms and soulful Creole singing. ""Kompa is a genre of Haitian music invented by saxophonist Jean-Baptiste Nemours, derived from the meringue and close to calypso,"" explained Vanessa Francklin of KompaParis.com. ""Kompa wants to be open, warm and festive. [It has] bold brass, heavy bass, very inspired guitars, keyboards and percussion sounds with fire,"" she continued. ""The music is honest, vibrant, and has things to say. This is the music of a people that has long suffered and still suffers,"" she finished. As Kompa's profile grows worldwide, many of its musicians are hoping it will not only now help raise funds, but cast Haiti in a more positive light. Bands are also writing special songs dedicated to disaster relief, including Tabou Combo, one of the more famous kompa bands in Haiti, their new song is called ""Haiti Will Never Die."" ""A lot of people are getting to know who we are as Haitians through our music,"" added Guirand. ""We are not only miserable as you see on TV. Our music shows we are rich in culture.""

637,"(CNN) -- A U.S. Navy destroyer helped two Iranian civilian sailors found Thursday floating in a life raft in the Persian Gulf. A merchant vessel spotted the raft and launched a flare, the U.S. Fifth Fleet said in a statement. The USS Oscar Austin located the raft about 1,000 yards outside of Iranian territorial waters, the Navy said. ""After providing the two distressed mariners food and water, a rigid-hulled inflatable boat from Oscar Austin towed the life raft closer to the ship in the event the men required any urgent aid or further assistance,"" according to the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. The Iranians said their boat sank the night before, and they were unaware of what became of their shipmates, the statement said. An Iranian Coast Guard vessel retrieved the two sailors, and its crew thanked the Austin crew for their assistance. ""We're glad that we were able to coordinate the rescue of the mariners with the Iranian Coast Guard,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Ansuinni.","U.S. Navy assists two Iranian sailors .

638,"(CNN) -- A tour bus driver has been confirmed dead, while hopes dimmed for possible survivors of rock slides unleashed by Typhoon Megi last week in Taiwan. Tour bus driver Tsai Chih-ming, 19 Chinese tourists and a Chinese tour leader went missing Thursday along the Suhua Highway, in northeast Taiwan. Sections of the scenic highway, which is perched along a cliff on the island's eastern coast, gave way. Tsai's remains were positively matched with a DNA sample from his daughter, official Taiwanese media said Tuesday. Identification is pending for several other sets of remains that have been found. Confirmation of the driver's death brought Megi's death toll to 14 in Taiwan, its Central News Agency said. The typhoon injured nearly 100 others on the island last week. Family members of the missing Chinese tourists have asked Taiwanese officials to expand the search, hoping to at least find remains. Three dozen family members arrived on the island from southern China on Monday night. ""I was expecting to see my sister alive two days ago, but the chance of finding anybody alive is dim,"" Zhou Lifang said of missing tourist Zhou Suhua. ""But I'm still waiting for my sister, no matter herself or her body,"" she told China's state-run Xinhua news agency. ""The rescue team should expand its search areas."" The Taiwanese military has deployed helicopters, patrol boats and divers as part of search efforts. The navy was weighing whether to also dispatch a mine sweeper to further the search, the Central News Agency said. ""I'm moved by local rescue workers, because they are risking their lives to search for the missing,"" said missing tourist Wu Rika's sister-in-law, Zhao Hongbing. ""But from what I saw today, I think the local rescue authorities should mobilize more people and use more large machinery. I don't know when we can see our relatives with the current rescue force,"" she told Xinhua. Typhoon Megi struck the Philippines earlier last week, affecting an estimated 258,800 people and leaving thousands homeless. The typhoon made landfall in China's southeastern province of Fujian on Saturday, affecting nearly 650,000 people and destroying 500 houses, China's Xinhua news agency said. About 270,000 people had evacuated. Damage in Fujian from the strongest typhoon of the year was estimated at 1.59 billion yuan ($238 million).","Identification is pending for several other sets of remains .

639,"(CNN) -- More than 100 students at St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens, New York, have fallen ill recently. Some have tested positive for swine flu, health authorities say. New York high schooler Arianna Anastos and dad Chris talk with CNN's Anderson Cooper about the outbreak. At least 50 people in the United States have contracted the virus, officials say. Some of those who tested positive at the New York high school recently went to Cancun, Mexico, for spring break. By Tuesday, the number of deaths believed attributable to swine flu climbed to as many as 152 -- all of them in Mexico. (Twenty-six cases, including seven deaths, have been confirmed in the country.) St. Francis student Arianna Anastos, 16, wasn't on that spring break trip to Mexico, but her friends were. She started exhibiting flulike symptoms and was hospitalized last weekend. CNN's Anderson Cooper spoke Monday night with the teen and her father, Chris, on ""AC 360°."" Anderson Cooper: Arianna, how are you feeling right now? Arianna Anastos: I'm feeling a lot better now. Cooper: When did you first start to feel sick -- and what did you feel like? Arianna: I felt sick on Thursday. I was really dizzy. And I started having a fever and a cough. And I -- I had trouble breathing. Cooper: How bad did the fever get? Arianna: About 103 by Saturday. Cooper: So then what did you do about it? Arianna: I went to the hospital with my mom. And we waited for about an hour. And I got tested by the strep throat test and the nose swab. Cooper: You -- you haven't been to Mexico. How do you think you got it? Arianna: Probably from someone else. I mean, like, you know, people touch the railing on the school, like, and then I touch them, so any possible way. Cooper: Chris, you must have been incredibly concerned. How ... did you deal with this? Chris Anastos: Well, it was terrible. On Saturday morning, she looked like she was run over by a truck really. It really scared us. But ... Cooper: What do you mean by that? ... How did she look? Anastos: Well, she was on the couch lying down with her eyes closed, could not move, could not even open her eyes. I had a wet towel over her eyes to keep her temperature down. ... Cooper: Arianna, you went to the hospital on Saturday. ... Did they give you Tamiflu? Arianna: Yes. Cooper: So how soon after taking the Tamiflu did you start to feel better? Arianna: After two pills, I started feeling better. Cooper: How do you deal with the fear about spreading it? I mean, Arianna, were you worried that you might give it to other family members? Arianna: Yes. I mean, my parents would, like, come into the room, but they would wear masks and gloves. And they wouldn't allow anyone into the room. And they wouldn't allow me, like, to touch anything in the house, or else my mom would, like, spray it with Lysol. So, you know, no one got sick. .... Anastos: We took every precaution we could to prevent the spreading. And, obviously, we were -- my wife and I and my other daughter did not get it. So it worked for us. Cooper: So -- so, they gave you masks at the hospital, and you made sure to wear those around the house? Anastos: Yes. Yes. They -- they really did a good job. They explained to us what we needed to do. They gave us the equipment. And we just followed directions, and nothing happened to us. And Arianna is almost 100 percent. Cooper: Well .... I'm glad, Arianna, that you're feeling better. It's amazing what a difference two pills can make. And I'm glad you were able to get the Tamiflu. Arianna: Yes. Cooper: And I'm glad you're feeling better, and I'm glad no one else in your family caught this.","More than 100 students at New York high school fell ill with flulike symptoms .

640,"(CNN) -- Four buildings on The Ohio State University campus were evacuated Tuesday after the FBI's Columbus, Ohio, bureau notified the university it had received an anonymous message that explosives were placed in the buildings, authorities said. The buildings are the William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library, the McPherson Chemical Lab, Smith Laboratory and Scott Laboratory. Classes in the three academic buildings involved were canceled, and all four buildings were closed until at least 5 p.m. or until the investigation is complete, according to Vernon Baisden, the university's director of public safety. Officials did not say whether any explosives had been found in the buildings. The university was notified of the threat at 8:19 a.m. and activated its Buckeye Alert System at 8:41 a.m., according to a message posted on the Ohio State website. Nearby streets were closed to vehicle traffic, university Police Chief Paul Denton told reporters. Local, state and federal authorities were assisting in the investigation, Baisden said, but he said officials could release few details about specifics. Aerial footage showed authorities with dogs entering one of the buildings. Students and employees ""responded in an orderly fashion,"" Baisden said, ""and we have no reports of any real confusion, other than the fact that everybody was wondering what was going on."" Asked whether the threat was targeting labs, Baisden noted that labs are located in many locations on the Ohio State campus.","The buildings will remain closed until at least 5 p.m., officials say .

642,"(CNN)  -- Felipe Massa will not be returning to Formula One this season, his Ferrari team have officially announced. Massa is still showing the scars of the horror crash at the Hungarian GP in July. The Brazilian has been out of action since a freak crash in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix left him with life-threatening head injuries. The speed of his recovery from a fractured skull has prompted speculation he could take the wheel of the Ferrari for the season-ending race in Abu Dhabi on November 1. Indeed Massa was back on the track in a private test at Ferrari's Maranello headquarters in Italy on Monday, but the team insist that is merely a stepping stone for next season. ""This is in no way a proper test session and looking at the stopwatch will not be on the agenda - there will be plenty of time for that in 2010, when, alongside Fernando Alonso, he will begin development work of the new single-seater,"" read a statement on the team's oficial Web site www.ferrari.com. Ferrari did reveal that a medical check up that Massa underwent in Paris last Friday proved ""rather positive"" but emphasized it did not signal a dream return. ""Felipe and the team want to proceed gradually and without any hurry to recover as well as possible from the effects of the accident that happened in Budapest back on 25th July. ""Therefore talk of a proper return to Formula One can wait until the start of the 2010 season and only at that time will the medical checks be carried out, as required by the FIA in order to allow someone who has been injured to return to racing."" Giancarlo Fisichella will continue to deputize for Massa for the remaining two races of the season in Brazil and Abu Dhabi, driving alongside Kimi Raikkonen of Finland. Raikkonen is leaving the team at the end of the season to be replaced by two-time world champion Alonso, who will carry Ferrari's hopes for 2010 alongside 2008 title runner-up Massa. The 28-year-old Massa was hit in the head by a spring which fell from the Brawn GP car of fellow Brazilian Rubens Barrichello. There were fears for his life in the immediate aftermath of the horror crash as he lay in an induced for coma in a military hospital in Budapest. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher was slated to replace him in a sensational return to Formula One, but the German superstar had to cut short his comeback due to a neck injury. Test driver Luca Badoer proved a below-par replacement and Fisichella, who will stay at the Ferrari next season as the reserve driver, jumped ship from Force India for the drive.","Ferrari say Felipe Massa will not be returning to F1 circuit this season .

643,"(CNN) -- The federal Bureau of Land Management said Friday that it had only one ranger on duty and that it failed to follow its own procedures in permitting an off-road race in Southern California where eight spectators were killed in a crash. ""This tragic accident was a call for us to take an unvarnished look at what went wrong and what BLM can do to improve safety and oversight of these types of races,"" said acting Bureau of Land Management State Director Jim Abbott. Since the crash during an August 14 event in Johnson Valley, near San Bernardino, the agency has taken steps to ensure all approval procedures are carefully followed, it said in a statement. The California Highway Patrol is leading the investigation into the incident, which left eight people dead and nine injured when a truck taking part in the 200-mile event crashed into a crowd of spectators along the track. The driver did not face charges, the highway patrol said at the time. The Bureau of Land Management is investigating whether sanctioning body Mojave Desert Racing violated any safety regulations, spokeswoman Jan Bedrosian told CNN. Since the crash, the agency has approved 20 permits from organizers for events across the California desert, Bedrosian said. Four were denied, and five from Mojave Desert Racing were suspended, she said. Messages for Mojave Desert Racing were not immediately returned Friday. Daniel Hesser, public information officer for the California Highway Patrol Inland Division, said the investigation is continuing and there was no timetable for submitting findings. ""We're talking to everyone we can,"" he said. The August race was part of an amateur series on a course in the Lucerne Valley area of San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles. Mojave Desert Racing urges spectators to stay back 100 feet from the 50-mile course, but a Highway Patrol spokesman said there were ""no delineations"" for the course. Images from the night of the crash show trucks speeding within feet of spectators. The bureau found its procedures for race events are appropriate, but said that offices did not always carry them out. ""Adherence to these procedures was inconsistent throughout the five BLM field offices in the 11-million acre California Desert,"" it said in a statement. There was no pre-race review or detailed look at the August race's operating plan, Bedrosian said. And only one ranger was on duty. ""Obviously, the one was not adequate that night,"" Bedrosian said, adding that some events now are being staffed by three to five federal rangers. The department has only 38 rangers in the desert and is ""spread awfully thin,"" Bedrosian said. But it is committed to permitting and staffing events to ensure they are conducted in a safe manner, she added, . Bob Abbey, national director of the Bureau of Land Management, said that a directive to field offices stresses event safety. ""If our field offices cannot fulfill or complete all the required steps in authorizing this event, then no permit will be issued,"" he said. The report concludes with specific action items. These include providing adequate Bureau of Land Management ranger and recreation staffing at all events, requiring companies to compensate the bureau for processing and administering permits that take up more than 50 hours of staff time, and requiring more oversight from the bureau's district and state offices to check for policy compliance and program consistency. ""Everyone looks at this with a shared sense we all need to do better,"" Bedrosian said.","Bureau of Land Management didn't follow own procedures, internal report says .

644,"(CNN) -- A Rutgers University football player remained in intensive care Monday after suffering a spinal cord injury while making a tackle in the fourth quarter of a game against Army on Saturday. Junior defensive tackle Eric LeGrand has no movement below his neck due to the injury at the C3 and C4 level of the spinal cord, according to a statement from the university's athletics department. Doctors at Hackensack University Medical Center performed emergency surgery on LeGrand overnight Saturday to stabilize his injured spine, the university said, but hospital officials declined to comment Monday about LeGrand's injury or condition, citing patient privacy laws. Generally, the higher up on the spine an injury occurs, the more the nervous system is affected. LeGrand's injury occurred in the middle of the neck. Doctors said Monday that with many spinal cord injuries, the first 72 hours after surgery give a good indication of how much function a patient may recover. ""Eric is in good spirits, and we are praying for a full recovery,"" LeGrand's family said in statement. The Scarlet Knights' head football coach, Greg Schiano, affirmed the family's optimism. ""Eric, his family and the Rutgers Football family believe he will recover,"" Schiano said. ""We ask our fans and the entire Rutgers community to believe and pray for Eric as he begins the recovery process."" One of those fans praying for LeGrand is former Penn State University football player Adam Taliaferro. Ten years ago, Taliaferro made a tackle in a game against Ohio State that would alter the course of his life. ""Unfortunately, I had my head down a little bit,"" Taliaferro said, recalling the hit that shattered his C5 vertebrate -- slightly lower on the spinal cord than LeGrand's injury. ""I went to roll over to get up, and nothing happened. I said, 'Doc, I can't move.' "" After his injury, Taliaferro says, he was mentally in shock. His family and teammates helped him stay positive, but his doctors were cautious. They never told him he wouldn't walk again, but they never said he would, either. ""They don't want to give you false hope, but I was under the impression that said, 'Hey, I am going to get through this thing,' "" Taliaferro said. The weeks went by -- no movement. Until finally, five weeks after his injury, Taliaferro wiggled a toe. ""When I got that movement, that's when I really started to believe that I was going to walk again,"" he said. Four months later, Taliaferro took his first steps. Today, a decade later, he says he walks ""pretty normally"" and works out routinely to maintain the movement he has recovered. He says the benefit of being a football player aided his recovery. ""You're used to working hard. You're in the best shape of your life,"" he said. On Sunday, Taliaferro watched the footage of LeGrand's injury sustained as he made an open field tackle on a punt return. Immediately after the collision, LeGrand is seen on his back with his legs sticking straight out at a 45-degree angle, unmoving except for a shake of his head. ""I watched him moving his head, and like myself, he was probably trying to get up,"" Taliaferro said. ""I certainly 100 percent understand what he was going through laying there."" Last season, as a backup defensive tackle, LeGrand played in all 13 games, according to the Scarlet Knights online roster. In 2008, LeGrand played his first collegiate game against North Carolina. At Colonia High School in New Jersey, LeGrand was a starter on his high school football team.","Eric LeGrand has no movement below his neck .

645,"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- An experienced diver and master sergeant in the South Korean navy died Tuesday while conducting rescue efforts for 46 seamen who were aboard a patrol ship when it sank, a military official said. The 53-year-old chief master sergeant lost consciousness while underwater in the Yellow Sea, the official said. He was taken aboard a U.S. Navy ship, the USS Salvor, but could not be resuscitated. The 1,200-ton patrol ship Cheonan was carrying 104 sailors when an apparent explosion caused it to capsize Friday night in the Yellow Sea near a disputed maritime border between North and South Korea. Fifty-eight sailors were rescued shortly after the ship capsized, but hopes are fading for the remaining 46. No bodies or survivors have been found since the 58. U.S. divers were on the scene Tuesday and were observing the situation, according to the official. The U.S. divers plan to enter the water on Wednesday, he said. Efforts were under way to pump air into the ship's stern, and ropes were also being attached to the ship to provide divers with some guidance while underwater, the official said. Visibility is poor -- only about a meter (3 feet) -- and the current is about 5 knots (5 mph). South Korean divers were struggling to gain access to stern of the ship, where most of the missing crew members are believed to be, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Tuesday. Defense officials told the news agency access to the stern was hampered by the current. Monday evening was the end of a 69-hour window during which rescuers believed the sailors could survive. Divers have knocked on the hulls of different parts of the ship with hammers, but raised no response. South Koreans have held out hope the crewmen might be rescued, but by Tuesday hopes for a happy ending were fading. Meanwhile, officials were no closer Tuesday to determining the cause of the explosion that sunk the Cheonan. The country's defense minister has said it could have been caused by an old mine. Kim Tae-young told a meeting of the parliamentary defense committee on Monday that one of the many North Korean sea mines placed during the 1950-53 Korean War could have triggered the blast. Yonhap has quoted military officials as saying that the explosion tore a hole in the rear of the ship, shutting off the engine. Citing accounts of rescued sailors who handled the ship's radar, Kim said they reported no signs of a torpedo attack ahead of the explosion. The navy plans to salvage the vessel, which was carrying missiles and torpedoes, to determine what caused the incident, Yonhap reported. President Lee Myung-bak has called for a thorough investigation into the cause of the explosion. Baengyeong Island, the Seoul-administered island near the scene of the accident, is a flash point maritime border area between the Koreas. Given Baengyeong Island's proximity to North Korea, North Korean involvement was feared, but South Korean officials have played down that scenario. North Korea's official media has yet to mention the incident, according to Yonhap, but accused the United States and South Korea of conducting a maritime drill for the purpose of invading North Korea. ""Military tension is intensifying on the Korean Peninsula due to the brazen moves by the U.S. and its war-mongering puppets to provoke a war,"" North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said, as reported by Yonhap. Journalist Andrew Salmon contributed to this report for CNN.","NEW: U.S. divers plan to enter water on Wednesday, official says .

646,"(CNN) -- Four people, including three children, were found dead inside a home in a peaceful, family-oriented northwest Florida neighborhood Saturday, police said. A Florida medical examiner is working to determine exactly what caused the death of the adult and three children, who are believed to be two 6-year-olds and a 3-year-old toddler, Tallahassee police spokesman David McCranie said. Police have launched a homicide investigation, given the condition of the dead. ""There's obvious violence in the home,"" said McCranie. ""How that violence transpired, we're not sure."" Investigators have talked with neighbors, friends and relatives of the dead, who were found in a single-family residence. McCranie said that police are not yet identifying the relationship between the dead. ""I really don't believe it, that I'm not going to see those little girls running around, up and down the street anymore,"" neighbor Darius Mount told CNN Tallahassee affiliate WCTV. McCranie said police found the bodies in a home in a ""typical suburban Tallahassee neighborhood."" The subdivision, ""no more than one to two square miles"" in size, he said, was built within the last five years. ""There are a lot of kids, and it's quiet, peaceful,"" McCranie said. As of early Saturday evening, there were no official suspects in what McCranie called an ""active, ongoing investigation."" He said that authorities hope to have more information Sunday about the investigation. ""Right now, it's putting all the pieces of the puzzle together,"" McCranie said.","Police start a homicide probe after finding 4 people dead in Tallahassee .

647,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's health system, once the envy of many African nations, is ""in a state of collapse"" -- with many hospitals either completely shut down or unable to admit new patients, a leading doctors' group said Thursday. Doctors and nurses in Harare protest at the state of Zimbabwe's collapsing health system. The failure of medical services has forced doctors to turn away pregnant women and the sick. And with a cholera epidemic sweeping through the capital city of Harare and surrounding areas, medical officials say they fear they will be faced with hundreds of normally preventable deaths in the coming days. The four main hospitals in Harare have stopped admitting patients because of a medicine shortage, said the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights. Another hospital in the second largest city of Bulawayo -- 439 km (272 miles) from Harare -- is facing a similar shortage. ""Sick people in need of attention are being turned away,"" the group said. In many hospitals, maternity services have been scaled back -- meaning women who need to deliver babies by Caesarian section ""will needlessly die during childbirth,"" it said. The hospitals, like everything else in the country, are a victim of the country's collapsing economy under President Robert Mugabe, the group said. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwean government has asked a group headed by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan to postpone a visit meant to highlight the country's humanitarian crisis, calling it a ""partisan"" attempt to boost the opposition. Annan was set to arrive in Zimbabwe this weekend with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and rights activist Graca Machel, wife of former South African president Nelson Mandela. The trio wanted to find ways to ease the plight of Zimbabweans, nearly half of whom are in need of emergency food aid. But the state-owned daily newspaper, The Herald, says the three -- who belong to a group of senior statesmen known as the Elders -- were trying to boost the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), in power-sharing talks with Mugabe. With the political crisis showing no signs of abating, Zimbabwe's inflation rate has skyrocketed to the world's highest: 230 million percent. Independent analysts put the figure in billions. Doctors and nurses are reluctant to come to work because of the poor pay and poor equipment. Those who can are leaving Zimbabwe for neighboring countries or to Europe and Australia, the group said. The group held Mugabe's government responsible for the cholera epidemic that broke out early last month in the capital city and has since spread to other parts of the country. The government has not been able to dispose of sewage properly, nor has it been able to provide chemicals to treat water to make it potable, the group said. Residents are ""surrounded by flowing raw sewage,"" and many have been forced to resort to drink contaminated water from rivers, the group said. The pandemic, it said, ""has caused hundreds of preventable deaths."" The government has not released official figures of cholera-related death. But some private doctors say that in Harare, the number is at least 200. Earlier this week, a state-owned newspaper said 44 people had died since Friday in the southern border town of Beitbridge, about 600 km (372 miles) from Harare. The country's health ministry insists the disease has been contained. It said the lack of proper infrastructure in the impoverished nation is behind the outbreak, and that it has dispatched teams of health workers to educate the masses and provide them with water tanks. But medical activists disagree. Non-governmental aid groups are providing water and water purification tablets to the most affected communities. But they cannot reach everyone. The government should declare the cholera outbreak a national disaster and solicit international assistance, the group said. ""Definitely the government is not capable,"" said Dr. Douglas Gwatidzo, who is part of the doctors' group. "" It does not have the capacity to control the spread of cholera or to put a stop to it at the moment."" On Tuesday, doctors and nurses demonstrated against the government's failure to prevent the collapse of the health system. Baton-wielding police officers broke up the rally. Meanwhile, a unity government in Zimbabwe has yet to materialize. The main political opposition party refuses to join one unless Mugabe meets several conditions. The party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), and Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, signed a power-sharing resolution in September, but the agreement has failed to ease political tensions. The MDC accuses Mugabe of grabbing all key ministries such as home affairs, information, local government, foreign affairs and defense. It said it wants an ""equitable"" distribution. The stalemate continues. -- CNN's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report.","Main hospitals in Harare stops taking patients due to medicine shortage .

648,"(CNN) -- Heavy snow in northern and central China has killed 21 people since Monday, the country's Ministry of Civil Affairs said Friday, according to state-run media. Xinhua news agency said the ministry did not provide the causes of the deaths, except to note that two school canteens had collapsed in Hebei and Henan provinces since Wednesday, killing four children. The snow began to fall Monday on northern and central Chinese provinces, including Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Hubei and Shaanxi, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Xinhua reported. More than 9,000 buildings have collapsed since then, Xinhua said. Citing the ministry, it said the snow has caused an estimated 4.5 billion yuan (nearly $660 million) in damages. The ministry said about 159,000 people have been evacuated from their homes or stranded vehicles, Xinhua reported. Civil Affairs Minister Li Xueju has ordered local authorities to provide food, water and clothing to those who are still stranded, ""and to make proper arrangements for people who lost their homes in the snow to get through the winter,"" Xinhua reported. It said the Civil Affairs Ministry and the Ministry of Finance have allocated 20 million yuan (about $3 million) from their central budgets to Shanxi and Hebei provinces to help move those affected by the snow and to help them build houses.

649,"(CNN) -- The death toll in the Philippines from Typhoon Megi has climbed to 11 as the powerful storm moved away from the country. According to civil defense officials, four people died in Pangasinan province: Three were killed by a falling tree, and the fourth by lightning. Three more died in a storm surge in Isabela province, and one person drowned while trying to cross a river in Nueva Ecija province. Additionally, the National Disaster Risk Reduction & Management Council reported that one person drowned in the town of Cagayan, one was killed by a falling tree in Kalinga province, and one was killed by another tree in the city of Baguio. On Tuesday, Megi carried sustained winds of about 167 kph (104 mph) off the coast of the Philippines in the South China Sea, CNN meteorologist Jennifer Delgado said. But parts of the Philippines could still be vulnerable to mudslides and landslides. The typhoon could approach Hong Kong and mainland China in the next few days. Megi could bring heavy rain to already-drenched areas such as Hainan and Vietnam, where state media said at least 20 people have died from recent flooding. Journalist Eduardo Lingao in Manila contributed to this report.","NEW: Megi could bring more rain to already-drenched Hainan and Vietnam .

650,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A young boy fell to his death from a luxury suite at Los Angeles' Staples Center on Sunday night, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The 2-year-old boy fell from the suite around 9:15 p.m. (12:15 a.m. ET), police said in a statement. The boy was transported to the USC Medical Center, where he later died, Sgt. Frank Alvelais told CNN. The toddler  fell a few minutes after the conclusion of a NBA game between the Los Angles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. After the game, the boy's family and others in his group were taking pictures while still in the luxury suite section of the arena, police said. The third deck of the Staples Center -- where the luxury suite is located -- has a roughly 50-foot drop, according to KTLA. The boy was identified by Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter as Lucas Anthony Tang. An autopsy is pending, Winter said. Witness said the child was still moving his legs and arms as he was being put on a stretcher, KTLA reported.

651,"(CNN) -- A wrongful death lawsuit filed in the aftermath of a July boat accident questions the safety of amphibious tour vessels, but the so-called duck boats' record indicates just two fatal accidents in more than 50 years of service. On July 7, a 250-foot sludge barge pushed by a tugboat overran a disabled 33-foot Ride the Ducks tour boat, plunging the amphibious vessel with its 35 passengers and two crew members under the surface of the Delaware River in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Two student tourists from Hungary, Dora Schwendtner, 16, and Szabolcs Prem, 20, drowned. Ten other passengers suffered minor injuries, according to a National Transportation Safety Board initial report released September 10. Ride the Ducks has suspended its Philadelphia operation since the accident, but company President Chris Herschend said he expected tours to resume soon. The company is working out details with the U.S. Coast Guard and the city. In a statement released to the media, Herschend pointed to the tugboat's failure to heed repeated radio calls alerting it to the disabled vessel in its path. A lawsuit filed on behalf of the students' parents claims, among other things, that duck boats are inherently unsafe. ""There is no doubt that Dora and Szeb, on their first trip to America, thought they were safe when they boarded the duck boat. They had no idea they were on an accident waiting to happen,"" said Holly Ostrov Ronai, one of the attorneys who filed the suit. But officials with the Coast Guard and Ride the Ducks say the vessels have an excellent safety record. ""Thirty-three years we've been in this business, Ride the Ducks, and we've never had so much as a wet shoelace before this tragedy,"" Herschend told CNN. Since starting operations in Philadelphia in 2003 , Ride the Ducks has safely transported more than 1 million passengers on more than 42,000 tours in the Pennsylvania city, a company statement said. Ride the Ducks is a subsidiary of Herschend Family Entertainment of Norcross, Georgia. The company owns Ride the Ducks operations in six locations, as well as the Dollywood theme park in Tennessee, Stone Mountain Park in Georgia, and other attractions. The original duck boat, with a standard Army six-wheel truck frame and a propeller, was designed to ferry troops and materiel from warships to land during World War II. General Motors Corp. built 21,000 of the vessels, officially called DUKWs, between 1942 and 1945, when production ceased. Most were scrapped after the war, but entrepreneurs converted a few dozen for jolly excursions across land and water for tourists. Herschend's 90 or so boats are latter-day replicas, manufactured at a Branson, Missouri, shop and designed to look like the WWII workhorses. Today, 128 duck-style boats have certificates to remain in service with several companies, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. Only one other fatal accident involving a DUKW has been documented. In 1999, the Miss Majestic -- owned by a now-defunct company -- sank in Lake Hamilton near Hot Springs, Arkansas; 13 passengers drowned. The NTSB investigated the accident and recommended several changes to ducks' design and operation standards, but the Coast Guard did not concur. Read the NTSB's preliminary report on the accident . Citing ""an unacceptable level of risk to passenger safety,"" the NTSB recommended in May 2002 that duck operators and refurbishers ""provide reserve buoyancy through passive means,"" such as installing watertight compartments or buoyant foam in the hull. Modern boats include such features. The NTSB also found that several of the Miss Majestic victims were trapped under the vessel's canopy as it rapidly sank and recommended that duck canopies be removed or modified to come off easily in an emergency. In a September 2002 response, the Coast Guard said existing regulations and standards, if followed, were sufficient to ensure passenger safety. ""When you follow the navigation rules, usually everything goes fine,"" Capt. Eric Christensen, chief of the Office of Vessel Activity at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, told CNN recently. ""The Coast Guard doesn't certificate inherently unsafe vessels,"" he said. Robert Mongeluzzi, an attorney representing the Philadelphia victims' families, says that's not a good answer. ""If they had canopies that were retractable and foldable -- like we've had on convertible cars for about 100 years -- they wouldn't have that problem"" of trapping passengers underwater, he said. Coast Guard regulations do not require duck passengers to wear personal flotation devices (PFDs), which puts them in danger of drowning, Mongeluzzi said. But the devices could pin their wearers against the vessel's canopy, which is what happened to several victims in the Arkansas accident, according to the NTSB. ""If you keep the canopy on, then you're damned if you do and damned if you don't,"" said Mongeluzzi, who characterizes the canopies as ""death cages."" ""If you put your PFD on, it's harder to get out. If you don't put your PFD on, you're more likely to drown. Passengers on a sightseeing cruise should never be faced with that life-or-death decision."" The preliminary NTSB report on the Philadelphia accident did not indicate whether passengers were wearing PFDs, but eyewitness accounts and images from the scene showed some were and some weren't when they were rescued. Ride the Ducks' Herschend says the circumstances of the 1999 Arkansas disaster and this summer's accident in Philadelphia were completely different, but his company's focus is always on safety. ""None of us are OK with this, and none of us want to ever go through it again,"" he said. The lawsuit is not likely to come to trial in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas for two to three years, Mongeluzzi said.","NTSB warned in 2002 that canopies on excursion vessels could trap passengers .

652,"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Rescuers in Chile have just another 89 meters (292 feet) left to drill and are expected to break through into the area where 33 miners are trapped by Saturday, Chilean Mines Minister Laurence Golborne said Thursday. Depending on whether engineers decide to encase the rescue shaft with steel casing, the 33 miners could be extracted from the collapsed San Jose gold and copper mine within two to 10 days after breakthrough, Golborne added. The miners have been trapped in a chamber since August 5. They are in contact with the outside world through a small bore hole that is being used to send them food, water, supplies and other necessities. Rescue crews have been drilling three separate, wider holes to send down a rescue capsule that will bring the men to the surface. Those rescue attempts have been labeled Plans A, B and C. ""We're advancing pretty well in Plan B. We restarted the drilling process and are hoping we can get contact more or less this Saturday. Depending [on] if we have to change the drill hammer or not it could be a bit earlier, but we're predicting [the] date for Saturday,"" Golborne said. Mine engineers will have to decide whether they need to encase the shaft with steel tubing to prevent rockfalls and further collapses as they extract the miners. ""We have to wait two, three or four days if we do not encase and eight to 10 days if we do the encasing. That will be based on technical matters decided by technical experts,"" he added. . The so-called Plan B drill, a Schramm T-130 rig, hit a depth of 535 meters by 8 a.m. Thursday following a 20-hour stoppage to change drill hammers and to survey the rescue shaft with a miniature camera. Earlier this week, the Plan B drill cut through 53 meters in just 12 hours, which means technically it could cover the remaining 89 meters down to the miners in just 20 hours. One of the rescue coordinators, Rene Aguilar, an engineer for state copper company CODELCO, said earlier this week they may encase the first 100 meters of the shaft, a process that could take just 10 hours. Once the miners are extracted they will undergo about two hours of health checks at a field hospital that has been set up at the mine. They will then be reunited with one or two immediate family members. Next, all 33 will be flown by military helicopter to the regional hospital in the city of Copiapo -- approximately a 15-minute flight. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Sept. 19 during his last visit to the mine that he planned to personally hug each of the 33 miners as they were pulled from the rescue shaft. He is due to depart on a government tour to Europe mid-month. First lady Cecilia Morel de Pinera is expected to arrive at the San Jose mine sometime Friday, Golborne said. ""Her plan is to spend some time with the miners' families,"" he said. Maria Segovia, sister of trapped miner Dario Segovia, said relatives would begin a vigil Thursday night that they will keep until a drill breaks through to the miners.","NEW: ""Plan B"" drill has just another 89 meters to go to break through .

653,"(CNN) -- Bermuda, which hasn't seen a major hurricane in some seven years, is about to get walloped by Igor, which forecasters termed large and dangerous Saturday night. The eye of the Category 2 storm may pass just to the west of the Atlantic Ocean island late Sunday, sharply increasing the likelihood of damaging winds, forecasters said. Such a landfall would spare Bermuda ""the worst of the storm surge, but will inflict some of the highest wind speeds ... on the island,"" said CNN meteorologist Angela Fritz. ""A direct hit would be the worst-case scenario, because the island would have to endure the extremely strong winds in the eyewall, as well as a dangerously high storm surge,"" said added. The hurricane is currently going through an ""eyewall replacement cycle,"" and, during this time, accurately forecasting its track becomes more difficult, said Fritz. A new eye begins to develop around the old eye of a hurricane during the replacement cycle. ""Fortunately, the forecast is that Igor will not strengthen more before approaching Bermuda. It is expected to maintain Category 2 status,"" Fritz added. Conditions on the island were deteriorating late Saturday ahead of Igor's expected passover late Sunday or early Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Tropical storm-force winds extend 345 miles (555 kilometers) from Igor's center. ""The winds are definitely a concern,"" said CNN weather producer Judson Jones. ""Igor is expected to remain a dangerous hurricane as it approaches Bermuda,"" the Hurricane Center said. ""Igor is a very large hurricane."" As of 11 p.m. EST Saturday, Igor was about 285 miles (455 km) south of Bermuda, packing sustained winds of about 100 mph (160 kph) as it headed north-northwest at 13 mph (20 kph). Hurricane-force winds extended up to 90 miles (150km) from the center. The storm could also produce as much as 9 inches of rainfall over the island, according to the Hurricane Center. Hurricane Fabian hit Bermuda in 2003, killing at least four people. It came ashore with 120 mph (193 kph) winds. Large waves generated by the storm were already pounding beaches Saturday afternoon, said CNN iReporter Michael Branco. ""A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant coastal flooding on Bermuda,"" the Hurricane Center said. ""The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves, especially along the southern coast."" The weather agency said swells will affect the East Coast of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Leeward Islands, Hispanola and parts of the Bahamas over the weekend. ""These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents,"" the Hurricane Center said. Branco, a native Bermudian, spent Saturday morning putting up storm blinds on his windows and securing his pets inside the house. On Friday, he stocked up on bottled water, canned food and batteries. He said that despite riding a number of storms out on the island, ""this one has my attention thus I am taking it very seriously."" Branco said he's most worried about potential damage to the roof of his home, which faces the island's southern shore -- the frontline for the approaching Igor's northerly track. ""Our roofs, which we use to catch our drinking water, can sometimes be vulnerable to high winds and pressure changes, so fingers crossed our roof is OK,"" he said. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Julia continued to diminish Saturday farther east in the Atlantic. As of 11 p.m. EST, Julia's maximum sustained winds were at 50 mph (85 kph), the Hurricane Center said. No coastal warnings or watches were in effect from Julia, and the storm is forecast to become a remnant low by early Monday, according to the hurricane center.","Igor termed a large and dangerous hurricane .

654,"Islamabad, Pakistan -- The data recorders for the plane that crashed and killed 152 people in Pakistan have been found, a government official said Saturday. Junaid Amin, the head of Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, told CNN the plane's voice and the flight data recorders have been found at the crash site. He says the analysis of the data and completing the crash investigation could take several months. Amin said the items will be sent to Germany or France since Pakistan doesn't have facilities to perform the analyses. The Airblue plane was headed to Islamabad from the sea port city of Karachi on Wednesday when it crashed in a hillside while trying to land. Pakistan observed a day of mourning Thursday for victims of the accident - the worst passenger plane crash on Pakistani soil. Officials do not know if weather played a factor in the crash Wednesday. Pakistan is in the midst of the annual monsoon season, when rain sweeps across the subcontinent from June until September. The deadliest crash involving a Pakistani airline occurred in September 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed into a mountain in Nepal, killing all 167 people on board, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported. The Airbus A321 was carrying 146 passengers and six crew members, the airline said. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan said two of the people aboard were American citizens.","The data recorders will be sent to Europe .

655,"(CNN) -- Denver Broncos wide receiver Kenny McKinley was found dead Monday afternoon in a Colorado home. Authorities said it appeared McKinley died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was 23. ""Deputies discovered a male in the second-floor master bedroom of the home and determined that male was deceased,"" the Arapahoe County sheriff's department said in a statement. ""Although the death of Mr. McKinley appears to be the result of a self-inflicted gunshot, the investigation into this matter ... is ongoing."" Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels will speak to the media Tuesday about McKinley's death. McKinley was selected by the Broncos in the fifth round (141st overall) of the 2009 NFL draft from the University of South Carolina, where he set the school records for receptions. He attended South Cobb High School in Austell, Georgia. He played in eight games with the Broncos as a rookie, but was placed on injured reserve before the start of the 2010 season after suffering a knee injury, according to the team. ""Everyone with the Broncos is shocked and saddened by the loss of Kenny McKinley,"" Broncos President and CEO Pat Bowlen said in a statement on the Broncos' website. ""He was part of the Broncos family and will be greatly missed by our organization. My most heartfelt condolences go out to Kenny's family and friends."" Read more about pro athletes and depression on SI.com . McKinley is at least the third Bronco to have died since 2007. Cornerback Darrent Williams, 24, was fatally shot near downtown Denver, Colorado, on January 1, 2007. Running back Damien Nash, 24, died after collapsing at a charity basketball game later that winter. McDaniels, the Broncos coach, called the death tragic. ""Kenny had a promising future on the football field, but more importantly, he was a great teammate whose smile and personality could light up the room. This is a tragic loss for our football team, and his family is in all of our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time,"" McDaniels said.","Kenny McKinley is found dead Monday afternoon .

A portion of the White House grounds was briefly evacuated during the incident. The passenger plane -- a Cessna 182 -- was intercepted by the F-16s at 2:19 p.m. EST, a statement from the North American Aerospace Defense Command noted. The plane was escorted to an airport in nearby Manassas, Virginia, where it landed at 2:32 p.m. EST. The Cessna pilot was a student pilot who initially took off from Warrenton, Virginia, the Federal Aviation Administration confirmed.

657,"(CNN) -- As public health officials across the country look into the salmonella outbreak that began in the spring, the state of California believes it has identified its earliest cases -- and says its investigation helped tip off the rest of the country to the source of the problem. On May 28 and 29, several people became sick after attending either a prom or a graduation party in Clara County, according to Joy Alexiou, a spokeswoman for the Santa Clara County Public Health Department. Tests on some of the victims, including a catering worker who nibbled on the food, determined that the culprit was salmonella, she said. That finding triggered an investigation. By interviewing prom- and party-goers about what they had eaten, the Santa Clara County Health Department found at least one common link -- a delicate custard-filled pastry called profiteroles that was served at both events. According to Michael Sicilia, a spokesman for the California Department of Health, the caterer had run out of pasteurized filler, and made the rest of the fillings with shell eggs. Throughout June and early July, county officials noted more clusters of two or more salmonella cases. In all, 42 people in Santa Clara County tested positive for salmonella, including six who ended up in the hospital, Alexiou said. Similar clusters were popping up all over California, including four in San Diego County -- one traced to a Korean restaurant -- and another incident involving food served on a movie set in Los Angeles, an incident under investigation by Los Angeles County. In Santa Clara County, investigators were faced with a dilemma. Because the link to eggs didn't emerge for several weeks after people fell ill, there were no eggs left to test. Local investigators relied on interviews with food preparers and companies to draw a trail back to a company in Iowa: Wright County Egg. In other counties, too, the trail led in the same direction, according to health officials. On July 29, the California Department of Health sent a notice to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, warning of a connection to Wright County Egg. Sicilia said the alert helped confirm the suspicions of officials in other states who were also investigating a surge in salmonella cases. California is just one of 23 states that received eggs potentially contaminated by salmonella from Wright County Egg or Hillandale Farms of Iowa, the distributors at the center of the recall of more than half a billion eggs. In Minnesota, the agriculture department noted its first seven cases between May 5 and 7. Investigators have been able to link those illnesses to a Mexican restaurant in Bemidji, which bought eggs that were produced at Hillandale Farms and distributed by a North Dakota-based wholesaler. Michigan is the latest state on the list of 23. The Michigan Department of Agriculture told CNN on Tuesday that eggs associated with the recall have been distributed in the state. As the federal government investigates the egg recall and the related salmonella outbreak that it says has sickened about 1,300 Americans, the regulatory process is coming under scrutiny from the agencies responsible and people affected by the food safety crisis. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday the investigation took a while because of its complexity. ""The clusters were very small. Two or three patients here, two or three patients there."" Frieden also indicated the organism and its DNA fingerprint are common, making it harder to isolate. It took weeks to determine the illnesses came from eggs and the producers who shipped them, he told the Atlanta Press Club. Frieden, who indicated federal, state and local health agencies are better now at working together, said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's new egg safety measures, along with a stalled food safety bill, are essential. ""I think the major focus has to be prevention."" John Boyd Jr., the founder and president of the National Black Farmers Association, said that a lack of regulation by the federal government allowed this public health scourge to happen. ""The bottom line here is there should have been more inspections before the outbreak. I know Congress is looking at ... legislation to bring more enforcement,"" Boyd, who said he's been a poultry farmer for 14 years, said on Tuesday's ""CNN Newsroom."" Speaking on a conference call with reporters Monday afternoon, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said federal regulations that took effect in July could have prevented the situation. The new regulations went into effect July 9 requiring egg producers with more than 3,000 hens to take measures designed to prevent the spread of salmonella. The current outbreak began in May and was traced to two Iowa farms, according to the FDA. One of them, Wright County Egg, has recalled 380 million eggs; the other, Hillandale Farms, recalled 170 million eggs. ""We believe that had these rules been in place at an earlier time, it would have very likely enabled us to identify the problems on this farm before this kind of outbreak occurred,"" Hamburg said. While FDA inspectors typically didn't inspect farms until after an outbreak of illness, Jeff Farrar, the associate commissioner for food safety at the Food and Drug Administration, said under the new rule, ""We will be beginning routine inspections of egg farms throughout the United States."" Food safety regulators don't expect any more recalls after last week's withdrawal of about 550 million eggs from the U.S. market, but inspections are still going on. Farrar would not release details of the inspections, which also involve a third operation that supplied the two egg producers, but the results could be released later this week, he said. While the recall involves hundreds of millions of eggs, they represent less than 1 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the United States each year, said Krista Eberle, director of the food safety program at the Egg Safety Center. The Egg Safety Center is run by United Egg Producers, a trade group that describes itself as a cooperative of egg farmers from all across the United States, representing the ownership of approximately 95 percent of all the nation's egg-laying hens. CNN Senior Medical Producer Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report.","NEW: 42 people in county tested positive for salmonella .

658,"(CNN) -- FedEx on Friday found a package containing radioactive material that went missing a day earlier at one of its shipping stations in Knoxville, Tennessee, the company said. The package contained a radioactive rod used in CT scans, which use X-rays to create images of patients' bodies. The shipment was lost in transit between its origination point, a hospital in North Dakota, and the equipment's manufacturer in Tennessee. FedEx spokeswoman Sandra Munoz said the rod was enclosed in a metal cylinder that was itself enclosed in a rectangular box. That rectangular box had originally been placed in another box that had the shipping information on it. ""We are trying to track down how the package became detached from the original shipment,"" Munoz said. FedEx employees found an unlabeled container Friday afternoon and opened it, revealing the metal cylinder, which remained closed. ""FedEx employees were never exposed to the radiation,"" Munoz said. Earlier, Munoz had said that if the metal container were opened, there would be some exposure to radiation, but at a low concentration. ""There would be some very low-level energy skin absorption there. It would take 1,000 hours of exposure to get skin blisters,"" she said. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","A missing package containing a radioactive rod is found, FedEx says .

659,"(CNN) -- A Chicago police officer processing a burglary scene and another person were fatally shot Friday afternoon, police said. The officer, an evidence technician, died at 2:30 p.m., one hour after the shootings in the 8100 block of South Burnham Avenue, said Police Superintendent Jody Weis. Police identified the officer, a father of four, as Michael Flisk, 46. Another man also died, Weis said, adding there was no information on a motive. The second victim was a retired Chicago Housing Authority officer, CNN affiliate WLS reported. ""The thought that someone can shoot and kill a police officer is unacceptable,"" Weis said. ""We will find those responsible. We shall squeeze that neighborhood and we will find who did this."" The gunman is described as a black male wearing a gray thermal shirt, a blue vest and a gray skull cap, according to WLS. Flisk was collecting evidence at a garage involved in a burglary, Weis said. The officer was a 19-year veteran of the police force and is survived by his wife and four children. He also has three siblings serving in the department. Flisk received 67 awards during his career, police said. The Chicago Police Memorial Foundation offered a $10,000 reward late Saturday for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whomever killed Flisk. The officer is the sixth to die in the city this year, according to WLS. Officer David Blake was shot to death inside his car Monday while off duty.","NEW: Reward offered in officer's death .

660,"New York (CNN) -- The first of three surgeries needed to construct the right ear of 9-year-old Aidan Sullivan came one step closer over the weekend after a New York charity donated $7,000 to replace money stolen from child's fund-raiser. Aidan's parents, Tim and Colleen Sullivan, received a call from The Vincent Crotty Memorial Fund of Suffern, New York, on Saturday to tell them it would contribute $7,000 toward the cost of the boy's upcoming surgery. ""They heard about our story on news and in the papers,"" Colleen Sullivan said. ""They called us up and came over and presented us with the check."" She said she and her husband ""feel honored"" that the charity chose their son, who suffers from a congenital disorder that has caused deformities in his jaw and skull. The money replaces cash reported stolen after a fund-raiser in Connecticut last weekend. Danbury, Connecticut, police Lt. Tom Michael said $7,000 in cash and $1,000 in checks were missing after a November 20 event sponsored by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, an Irish Catholic fraternal organization. Peter Crotty, whose charity's contribution matches the missing cash, said the donation ""seemed like the right thing to do."" Crotty said he read about the stolen donations on Thanksgiving and was saddened by the emotional distress inflicted on the Sullivans. Crotty founded his charity after the March death of his 18-year-old son and his son's best friend, Chris Konkowski, in a car accident while driving to baseball practice. He said Aidan's story caught his attention because of his own family's experience, ""because it was about a young boy and the emotional sadness and anxiety that people feel due to loss."" Crotty said his organization has received four other contributions nationwide from families who want to get involved. The $7,000 will go toward a scheduled March 1 procedure needed to reconstruct Aidan's missing right ear. While this will not cover all of his needed surgery, his parents are said they were grateful and excited. ""I was crying and touched,"" Colleen Sullivan said.

661,"(CNN) -- Crews in Taiwan have found body parts as the search unfolds for victims of rock slides unleashed by Typhoon Megi last week, official media said. Four sets of body parts have been found, with DNA testing to be done, Taiwan's official Central News Agency said. Nineteen tourists from southern China, a Chinese tour group leader and a Taiwanese bus driver went missing Thursday along the Suhua Highway, in northeast Taiwan. Sections of the scenic highway, which is perched along a cliff on the island's eastern coast, gave way. Three dozen family members of the missing Chinese tourists arrived in Taiwan on Monday night. They were to visit the site of the rock slides on Tuesday, China's state media said. Megi killed at least 13 people and injured nearly 100 others in Taiwan last week. It struck the Philippines earlier in the week, affecting an estimated 258,844 people and leaving thousands homeless. Typhoon Megi made landfall in China's southeastern province of Fujian on Saturday, affecting nearly 650,000 people and destroying 500 houses, China's Xinhua news agency said. About 270,000 people had evacuated. Damage in Fujian from the strongest typhoon of the year was estimated at 1.59 billion yuan ($238 million). No deaths or significant injuries were reported, thanks to rigorous typhoon precautions in Fujian, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, the state-run China Daily said.","Four sets have been discovered, with DNA testing to be done .

662,"(CNN) -- Authorities in northeast Texas were assessing damage Monday morning after a tornado destroyed homes, knocked train cars off their tracks and injured at least four people. Five homes in Rice, Texas, were destroyed as 125 mph winds whipped through a seven-mile swath of Navarro County Sunday evening, said Eric Meyers, the county's emergency management coordinator. Meyers rode out the tornado inside a vehicle and videotaped the twister as it tore the roof off a school about a block away. ""We are in the tornado! We are in the tornado!"" Meyers yells several times in the video. ""The sheer power was just amazing,"" Meyers said in an interview Monday on CNN's ""American Morning"" program. The storm, which struck around 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET), also turned over an 18-wheeler truck onto a passenger car, knocked 11 cars from a freight train off their tracks and caused extensive damage to Rice Elementary School, Navarro County Chief Deputy Mike Cox said. Video: 'People screamed, cried, and prayed' as tornado passed . Four people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, he said. In addition to ""significant damage"" from the storm moving through Navarro County, witnesses also reported possible tornadoes in other parts of northeast Texas Sunday evening, the National Weather Service said. Callers reported four tornadoes in Lone Oak, Texas, Fire Chief Chris Moore said, but authorities had not yet confirmed whether a twister had touched down there. The storm destroyed one home, damaged three others and knocked down power lines there, Moore said. Authorities called off a youth football game as winds picked up speed and hail pelted the county, he said. Are you there? Share your stories, photos and videos . Sonia Butler hunkered down in the bathroom of her Rice home with her brother as the storm hit. ""You could just hear the wind coming through the house and it felt like a big suction,"" she told CNN affiliate WFAA. ""And then it sounded like a loud train, and it only lasted -- not very long, but after that, after we came out of the restroom, our house was just gone."" Her husband, Raymond Butler, sought shelter in another part of the home as the storm hit. The room he stayed in remained untouched, but the storm demolished most of their home, ripping off the roof, shattering light bulbs and breaking their deceased daughter's track trophies. The storm also destroyed two trucks, a trailer, and a giant pecan tree on the property -- but it spared the grave of their daughter, who died last year. ""I just got down on my knees and said, 'Lord be with us,' "" Raymond Butler told WFAA. Joey Romero, 24, said he and his girlfriend rode out the storm in the freezer of a Sonic restaurant at a service station in Rice. They were driving from Dallas to Houston when it started to hail, he said. ""We pulled over under some covering. Hail the size of golf balls started falling. Then, we saw hail the size of baseballs,"" he said. Someone screamed when they saw a funnel forming behind Sonic, he said. The wind roared and the station lost power. ""The first few seconds it was all sort of surreal. I couldn't really believe it was happening. ... We all walked back in the freezer. It was cold in there and there wasn't light and people were starting to cry,"" he said. The hail shattered car windows, Romero said. The second-year medical student at University of Texas, Houston, said he helped treat injuries. A police officer told him a truck and a car had flipped over on the highway. After several hours, Romero was on the road back to Houston late Sunday. ""Even now, we can see the storm off to the east of us. The sky is pitch black,"" he said. Later Sunday, a possible tornado swept through Baldwin County, Alabama, knocking down power lines and tree branches, destroying a mobile home and shifting another mobile home off its foundation, said Leigh Ann Ryals with the county's Emergency Operations Center. One person was injured, Ryals said, and crews planned to continue surveying damage Monday. CNN's Jacqui Jeras, Catherine E. Shoichet, Jessica Jordan, Rick Martin and Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.","NEW: ""We are in a tornado,"" emergency official says on videotape of twister .

663,"(CNN) -- Leonard Skinner, the gym teacher who inspired the name of the legendary southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, has died. The band announced his death on its website, saying Skinner died in his sleep early Monday morning. He was 77. ""Coach Skinner had such a profound impact on our youth that ultimately led us to naming the band, which you know as Lynyrd Skynyrd, after him,"" wrote Gary Rossington, guitarist and a founding member of the band. ""Looking back, I cannot imagine it any other way. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time."" Band lore has it that Skinner was a coach and gym teacher at Robert E. Lee High School in Jacksonville, Florida -- and a stickler for the school's policy against long hair. He reportedly sent several students to the principal's office for violating the policy, including some who would go on to form an up-and-coming band with a tongue-in-cheek variation on his name. The band formed in the early 1970s and had a string of acclaimed songs, including ""Freebird"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama."" In October 1977, a plane crash in Mississippi killed lead singer Ronnie Van Zant; guitarist Steve Gaines; Gaines's sister, vocalist Cassie Gaines; an assistant road manager; and the pilot and copilot. But the band soldiered on, released more than 60 albums and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.","Skinner, 77, dies in his sleep, the band says .

664,"(CNN) -- A loft office collapsed at a Colorado Salvation Army thrift store, sending debris onto people below and launching a frantic search for someone who may have been missing, authorities said Friday. The second-story loft collapsed around 3 p.m., when 22 people were in the thrift store and warehouse complex in Grand Junction, fire department spokesman Mike Page told CNN. Authorities initially believed one person may have been missing, but later learned that everybody had made it out of the building. The search took several hours because of the large quantity of rubble that was being removed by hand, Page said. Police dogs were assisting with the search. Rescuers used thermal imaging at the facility on Ute Avenue, Page said. Teams drilled a hole into the wall on the opposite side of the building to continue the search operation.

665,"(CNN) -- A search is on for a missing Nepali sherpa who has summited Mount Everest 19 times. The mountain guide went missing after an avalanche on Saturday, said the mountaineering agency for which he works. An avalanche swept away Chuwang Nima Sherpa on 7,129-meter-high (23,389-foot-high) Mount Baruntse on Saturday afternoon, while he was fixing ropes for climbers at 7,045 meters (23,113 feet), said Jiban Ghimire of Sherpa Shangri-La Treks and Expeditions. ""Chuwang Nima was fixing ropes for another expedition in the mountain, because they asked for help, when the avalanche struck,"" Ghimire said. Chuwang Nima was climbing with mountain guide Melissa Arnot, from the U.S. state of Idaho. The two had planned an alpine-style climb, without any support staff and fixed ropes or stops till the summit, Ghimire said. A helicopter was dispatched to look for Chuwang Nima on Sunday morning, but had to return because of bad weather. Chuwang Nima, 39, is well known in mountaineering circles, and climbs and trains in the United States as well. He was in Denali National Park in Alaska for technical training and rescue operations during the summer, according to Ghimire. Apa Sherpa -- a 50-year-old Nepali -- holds the record for summiting Everest, with 20 climbs. Everest is the world's highest mountain above sea level, at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet).","The guide went missing after an avalanche on Saturday .

666,"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- The confirmation of five cholera cases in Haiti's capital is a ""very worrying development,"" a U.N. spokeswoman told CNN. Public health officials are working to keep the country's cholera outbreak from spreading in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where tens of thousands of people are still living in sprawling tent cities after January's devastating 7.0-magnitude earthquake. The fast-moving outbreak has claimed at least 253 lives on the impoverished island nation, and another 3,015 cases have been reported, according to Haiti's health ministry. Port-au-Prince could still be safe. The five patients were infected north of the capital, and those confirmed cases do not mean cholera has spread to Port-au-Prince, Imogen Wall, spokeswoman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Haiti, told CNN. ""Our response system worked, but obviously this is a very worrying development,"" she said. The five patients in Port-au-Prince were infected in Artibonite, north of the capital, Wall said. They traveled to the nation's main city, where health officials discovered them to be infected within the incubation period, she said. The five have been isolated and are receiving treatment, she said. But meanwhile, officials are stepping up sanitation efforts and setting up quarantine areas in Port-au-Prince. And authorities are bracing themselves for a possible larger outbreak nationwide. ""I think the only responsible thing we can do at the moment is prepare and plan for the worst case scenario,"" Wall said. Wall said aid organizations are working on constructing facilities to treat patients and sending more doctors to the affected areas. ""We're all right for supplies ... but we're short on medical personnel,"" she said. The cholera outbreak comes after recent heavy rains caused the banks of the Artibonite River to overflow and flood the area. The river was dammed in 1956 to create Lac de Peligre and  is Haiti's dominant drainage system. On Friday, officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Agency for International Development discussed the outbreak and efforts to work out a containment strategy. The CDC will send an 11-member team to Haiti over the next few days to find out which antibiotics will be most effective in treating the cholera outbreak. USAID will provide supplies needed to set up treatment centers. The group has already prepositioned 300,000 oral re-hydration kits and are distributing water purification kits in affected areas. Cholera is caused by a bacterial infection of the intestine and, in severe cases, is characterized by diarrhea, vomiting and leg cramps, according to the CDC. In such cases, rapid loss of body fluids can lead to dehydration and shock. ""Without treatment, death can occur within hours,"" the agency says. A person can get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the bacteria. During epidemics, the source of the contamination is often the feces of an infected person, and infections can spread rapidly in areas where there is poor sewage treatment and a lack of clean drinking water. All the reported cases in the Lower Artibonite involve severe diarrhea and vomiting, Wall said. Ian Rawson, director of Hospital Albert Schweitzer Haiti near Verrettes, said patients began showing cholera-like symptoms on October 16. The pace picked up significantly Tuesday and beyond, though he said the situation was under control Friday at his 80-bed facility about 16 miles east of Saint Marc. ""So far, we've been able to manage it,"" Rawson said, noting that new patients were now coming in via pick-up trucks about every 10 minutes. Temperatures in the mid-90s exacerbated the dual concerns about dehydration and people contracting cholera by drinking tainted water. People lined roadsides in and around villages with  buckets, hoping that passersby might have clean water, said Eric Lotz, Haiti's  national director for the nonprofit Operation Blessing. The U.N. mission in Haiti credited access to clean water and free medical facilities for preventing feared outbreaks of cholera and tuberculosis.

667,"Devecser, Hungary (CNN) -- The Hungarian government Thursday made an urgent request to the European Union for help in the cleanup effort after a reservoir holding industrial waste burst earlier in the week. The government wants expert assistance in three villages left covered by the toxic red sludge after the accident Monday, the official news agency MTI reported. Meanwhile, the sludge from an aluminum plant reached the Danube, Europe's second largest river, on Thursday as emergency officials worked to contain as much of the leak as possible. ""It is a huge tragedy for the whole country,"" said Anna Nagy, a Hungarian Disaster Management offical. ""We love the Danube, we're very proud of the Danube and we tried to protect it."" ""I hope we can save the life in the river,"" she said. Hungary needs time to calculate the cost of the disaster, saying that the government's first response had been to try to save lives and clean homes. Tibor Dobson, a top disaster management official, told CNN that the sludge -- which flowed from an aluminum plant reservoir that burst on Monday -- is less dangerous than it was when it spilled. Officials believe pH levels have dropped to within an acceptable range, making the river safe, Dobson said. They are monitoring the Danube for sign of toxicity, such as dying fish. Nagy said pH levels had fallen to 9.1. That's more alkaline than neutral, which is 7 on the scale, but much less than it was originally, at 13, the Catastrophic Protection Unit said Thursday. Emergency workers were pouring plaster and fertilizers in hopes it would bind with the sludge and counter its alkalinity. The exact chemical composition of the sludge has not been revealed, but aluminum processing normally involves compounds that include cyanide, cadmium and chromium. The environmental disaster -- which occurred nearly 100 miles west of Budapest near the town of Ajka -- has killed two children, ages 1 and 3, an elderly woman and a 35-year-old man whose SUV overturned in the sludge. About 250 people have been evacuated from their homes, said Gyorgi Tottos, a spokeswoman for Hungary's Catastrophe Protection Unit. The reservoir has since been repaired and the flow from the pool halted. But the material that flowed out of the reservoir continues to pose a threat. The plant received an operating permit in 2006, he said. The European Commission is studying a copy of the permit and sees nothing wrong with the paperwork so far, he added. The aluminum factory has said it will pay for the victims' funerals. It has property and liability insurance, insurer Allianz Hungaria Biztosito told CNN, but would not say how much. Residents were advised not to eat produce from gardens that were covered when the dam burst. It was not clear when residents evacuated from affected areas in the villages of Kolontar, Devecser and Somlovasarhely would be able to return home. The long-term consequences of the leak were also unclear. In some villages, police with guns patrolled some of the villages to keep looters at bay. A state of emergency has been declared in three counties, the State Secretariat of Governmental Communications said. CNN's Nic Robertson, Tommy Evans, Jim Boulden and Eileen Hsieh contributed to this report.","Hungary asks European Union for assistance in cleanup .

668,"(CNN) -- Singer Stephen Gately, a member of the Irish band Boyzone, died Saturday while vacationing on the Spanish island of Majorca, the group's Web site said Sunday. Stephen Gately was on Majorca with his partner, Andrew, when he died, according to Boyzone's Web site. His four bandmates were to travel to Majorca, the posting said. Gately, 33, was in Majorca with his partner, Andrew, the Web site said. It did not offer Andrew's last name. No further details about Gately's death were immediately available. Boyzone made history in the United Kingdom with 16 consecutive Top Five hits, according to Ticketmaster's Web site. It's one of Ireland's best-selling bands, with six No. 1 singles in the United Kingdom, and four No. 1 albums, Ticketmaster said. The group, which separated in 2000 to pursue solo projects, reunited in 2008. Its greatest hits album -- ""Back Again ... No Matter What"" -- was released last year. Gately joined the band in 1993 after answering an audition ad. ""A lot of people didn't think we would make it out of Ireland back then,"" he said previously on the group's Web site.

669,"(CNN) -- A stampede of fans erupted outside a South African stadium Sunday before a warmup match between Nigeria and North Korea leading up to the World Cup, police and the local organizing committee said. There were no fatalities reported, police said, but 14 people sustained minor injuries. A police official was in stable condition after being trampled by the crowd, and a second police officer had minor injuries. The match at Makhulong Stadium, in the Johannesburg suburb of Tembisa, was arranged by a private company, authorities said in a statement, and tickets were being handed out outside. ""Initial reports from the stadium, which is not a 2010 FIFA World Cup stadium, indicate that 10,000 tickets were distributed outside the stadium, but a number of fans wanted to enter the stadium without tickets,"" the statement said. ""It would seem that there was also some confusion among the crowd as to the ticketing system which led to disruptive behavior on the part of the crowd."" Police began implementing ""crowd management"" measures, but the group pushed against the gates, twice forcing them open, authorities said. Calm was restored after police reinforcements arrived. In a statement issued after the stampede, the sport's international governing body FIFA said the match had ""no relation whatsoever"" to the upcoming World Cup contests. FIFA wished a speedy recovery to those hurt, but added, ""Contrary to some media reports, FIFA had nothing to do with the ticketing of this game.""","NEW: ""No relation"" to World Cup matches, FIFA says .

670,"(CNET) -- Apple likes glass. A lot. You can tell that much from its many retail stores, and in its products where glass is used in displays, notebook trackpads, and both the front and back of the iPhone 4. That last place, though is what might be causing the company some headaches. That's according to a report today from Gdgt, which says that slip-on cases -- the kind that cover the back and sometimes front of the iPhone 4, have been the cause of serious cosmetic damage with the backside of the iPhone. Dirt and other loose bits of debris from your pocket end up in that space. Over time, that can lead to a shattered backside as small scratches grow to become large cracks that travel across the back of the device, much like a ding on a windshield. This has become a big enough problem, the report says, that Apple's engineers have been hard at work in ""a quiet lockdown,"" testing various third-party cases to see how widespread the problem is, and presumably to make sure it does not happen with future iterations of the device. The news comes at an especially interesting time given the recent expiration of Apple's free iPhone 4 case program (which included Apple's no closed-back bumper), and the reported beginnings of mass production for a CDMA version of the iPhone said to be coming to Verizon in early 2011. If Apple is planning to bring any physical design changes to that version of the iPhone, a back that's susceptible to cracking could very well be holding up that process. This wouldn't be the first time cracks have cropped up on Apple's hardware, or the iPhone line for that matter. Both the Mac G4 Cube, which was introduced in 2000, and the iPhone 3G experienced reports from users that the outsides were developing ""hairline surface cracks."" Similar blemishes had appeared on white versions of the company's MacBook notebooks, which Apple reportedly began acknowledging and repairing early last year. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

671,"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In the wake of Hurricane Tomas, cholera has reached the congested capital of Port-au-Prince, where as many as 73 people have come down with the potentially deadly infection. Dehydration is one of its tell-tale signs. In a camp in Cabaret, just east of Port-au-Prince, children lie on cots as life-sustaining fluids are pumped intravenously into their bodies. The cholera outbreak in Haiti has now killed 583 people and another 9,123 people have been hospitalized, according to Gabriel Timothe, director general of Haiti's Ministry of Health. Medical personnel fear rising waters over the banks of Haiti's Arbonite River, which they say is a source of contamination, have increased the risk of a wider rate of infections. ""We're doing everything we can to mitigate [the] spread,"" Dr. Jon K. Andrus, deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization, said during a press conference on Tuesday. Health officials had braced for problems after Tomas, fearing the hurricane that battered the Caribbean nation over the weekend could worsen the cholera outbreak. On Monday, Dr. Toni Eyssallenne of Hospital Bernard Mevs confirmed the first case of cholera -- in a 3-year-old boy -- to originate and manifest entirely in Port-au-Prince. Two more cases were confirmed Tuesday by Eyssallenne. A 41-year-old woman who contracted the disease has not traveled in a year, the official said. A 33-year-old who lives in a tent city uses a communal water source. She, too, did not bring the infection into the city. Previous cases had been centered in Haiti's Artibonite and Central Plateau regions, including the city of St. Marc, north of the nation's capital. Until Monday, health officials said that those being treated for cholera in Port-au-Prince all contracted the disease elsewhere. The young Port-au-Prince boy lived in a tent city across the street from a place that sells macaroni, and he had not traveled in over a year, and he hadn't had any contact with people from St. Marc or the Artibonite region, Eyssallenne said. After suffering from nausea and diarrhea, the boy was treated and released from the hospital after his condition improved. Hurricane Tomas' trek past Haiti killed 20 people and injured another 36, a Communications Ministry official said Monday. Seven people were missing and 5,954 were homeless, the official said. Health officials fear that the water dumped by the storm will worsen the outbreak. The concern is that overflow from latrines and septic tanks could contaminate the supply of fresh drinking water and contribute to the spread of the bacteria. In the capital, the canals were not overflowing, said American Red Cross spokeswoman Andrea Koppel. But that was not the case in cities west of the capital, which bore the brunt of Hurricane Tomas, she said. Still, even Port-au-Prince looks and smells like a dump -- a caldron of water, garbage and human waste. ""We get used to it,"" said one resident. Ten months after a magnitude-7 earthquake laid waste to much of the nation, people compete with animals scavenging through the ubiquitous dumps for scraps of food. ""The quick solution is management,"" said Environment Minister Jean Marie Claude Germain. ""Management meaning that you have a structure in place, but the structure was not conceived with the slums in mind."" But most of the residents of Port-au-Prince live in slums. ""We're working on it,"" Germain said. ""We will work with the private sector."" CNN's Paula Newton contributed to this story.","NEW: Two more Port-au-Prince cases confirmed .

672,"(CNN) -- More than seven months after the death of a luger practicing for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, the Coroners Service of British Columbia has ruled Nodar Kumaritashvili's death an accident caused by multiple blunt force injuries. Kumaritashvili, a 21-year-old from the republic of Georgia, died when his body went airborne and slammed into a metal post at about 90 mph (144 kph )during a training run shortly before the Olympics officially opened. The coroner's report, written by Tom Pawlowski, said Kumaritashvili's injuries ""proved immediately fatal."" There had been concerns from athletes about the speed of the record-setting track at the Whistler Sliding Center, according to a Georgian official. ""There were some questions asked by other athletes even before this tragic accident,"" Nikolas Rurua, Georgia's deputy minister for culture and sports, said in February. Rurua added that there had been several crashes in the same area. When the official luge competition started, male and female racers started from lower points on the luge track, which led to slower speeds. Pawlowski's report acknowledges concerns about the design of the track. ""Following Mr. Kumaritashvili's fatal incident, questions arose regarding athlete safety at the Whistler track and more specifically, the design of the track and the unprecedented high speeds attained at this venue, such as the record speed of 153.98 km/h [about 95.68 mph]."" Given the high speeds at the track, the International Luge Federation (FIL) asked the sliding center for more training days prior to the Olympics and required athletes to make numerous practice runs from various, lower parts of the course before graduating to the top of the course. ""A number of crashes were observed (68 crashes in 2,482 runs), but the FIL Technical Delegate also noted in his report that nobody was badly hurt,"" during a training week in Whistler, the coroner's report states. Pawlowski's report states that an FIL official sent a letter to the track designer expressing surprise over the speeds and said the designer's calculations of top speeds were incorrect. Kumaritashvili completed required training runs, the report states. But Pawlowski added, ""the relative lack of experience Mr. Kumaritashvili had on this challenging track set a backdrop for the incident and it was a significant disadvantage, as far as safety was concerned, for the athlete entering the high pressure environment of the Olympic Games."" The coroner's report recommends the two international federations over sliding sports -- which include bobsledding and luging -- conduct reviews about their involvement into track design and construction. Pawlowski said ""further and greater scrutiny of safety issues at the track is advisable."" ""It may be that risk can never be fully eliminated from the realm of sliding sports,"" the report added. Journalist Eka Kadagishvili contributed to this report.","Kumaritashvili died during a practice run for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics .

673,"(CNN) -- The death of a man who fell from an upper deck Sunday during a home game of the Chicago Bears has been ruled an ""accident"" by the Cook County Medical Examiner's office, a spokeswoman said Monday. The man was identified as Stuart Haverty, 23, of Chicago, and an autopsy Monday concluded that the cause of his death was multiple injuries from a fall, the spokeswoman said. Haverty fell from the upper level of the Bears' Soldier Field to the ground outside the stadium, police said. The incident happened around 5 p.m. Sunday while the Bears were playing the Philadelphia Eagles, said Veejay Zala of the Chicago Police Department. Haverty was pronounced dead at Northwestern Memorial Hospital at 5:27 p.m. The incident marked the second such deadly fall during a pro sports game in as many weeks. Last week, a 2-year-old boy fell to his death from a luxury suite at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. The boy fell at the conclusion of a National Basketball Association game and later died at the hospital. In July, a fan trying to catch a foul ball at a Texas Rangers game in Arlington, Texas, fell 30 feet, injuring himself and four others. Tyler Morris tumbled over the railing on the club level of the stadium, hit the railing on the suite level and then landed on the lower deck. His injuries were not life-threatening.

674,"(CNN) -- As many as 100 homes could be affected by flood waters in Wisconsin due to the failure of a 120-year-old sand levee along the Wisconsin River. The levee, near the city of Portage in Columbia County, began to give way Sunday night, according to the National Weather Service's Milwaukee/Sullivan office. Patrick Beghin, a representative of the Columbia County Emergency Operations Center, confirmed to CNN Monday that the levee had in fact failed. ""Once the levee completely fails ... it is unknown how far south the flood waters of the Wisconsin River will travel,"" the Weather Service said Sunday night. Portage Mayor Ken Jahn later told CNN that while the levee hadn't completely broken yet, it had deteriorated.  Local prison inmates were being used to help with sandbagging, he said. The levee is located on the south side of the Wisconsin River, just south of Portage. The weather agency urged residents to move to higher ground. Roadways, including parts of Interstate 39, could close. Authorities in Portage worked to evacuate residents as the levee approached imminent failure after heavy rainfall soaked the Midwest last week. An alert sent out by Columbia County Emergency Management (CCEM) on Sunday urged residents near Blackhawk Park to evacuate immediately ahead of the flooding, which is expected to wash out a main road leading to about 150 residences. ""Emergency vehicles including police, fire and EMS will not be able to reach residents,"" the statement said. Kathy Johnson, the deputy director of the county's emergency management department, said Sunday it was unclear how many residents remained in the area. ""Anyone in there right now won't be able to come out,"" she said. A Red Cross shelter was opened at a nearby church to accommodate displaced residents. The river at Portage is now expected to stay above flood stage -- 17 feet -- through Wednesday, Beghin said.   Portage won't be considered to be out of danger until the river has dropped below flood levels, he added. Beghin noted that the flooding situation is not as widespread as it was during a similar 1993 flood, even though the river has now crested at a higher level than it did 17 years ago. The Wisconsin River crested around 12 a.m. Monday at 20.56 feet -- roughly 3.5 feet above flood level, according to Beghin and the National Weather Service, putting major pressure on the Caledonia-Lewiston levee system. Forecasts suggest the river at Portage will undergo a second peak in height on Tuesday morning, adding more pressure to the compromised levee. Officials with the Department of Natural Resources have been monitoring the failed levee for days and trying to repair problem areas.  But the levee system, built in the 1890s, was constructed from locally available materials -- mostly sand -- ""without any engineering design or adherence to any standards,"" the Natural Resources department said in a statement last week. ""This is a 120-year-old relic,"" Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources spokesman Greg Matthews said Sunday. ""It's made of sand. ... A modern levee that our engineers would be familiar with would be constructed of steel and concrete."" The levee's failure comes after a week of rainfall that dumped as much as 11 inches of rain in parts of Wisconsin and neighboring Minnesota.  Portage itself, however, did not receive any of the heavy rain. Floodgates along the Menominee River in Niagara, Wisconsin, were opened in recent days to ease pressure on dams. Video showed a torrent of water gushing from an overflowing dam. ""I have never seen the water rage down like it is,"" CNN iReporter Jason Asselin said. CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said Sunday that there's no immediate end in sight to the flooding. ""Even though some of these rivers have crested ... keep in mind that they're still in flood, so this is going to be a problem for a couple of days,"" Jeras said. ""Many of these rivers are all going to be dumping into the Mississippi River which then in turn will rise up and we'll see some flooding there, maybe in La Crosse and the Winona areas later in the week.""

675,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The pilot of a doomed plane that crashed, killing 50 people, said ""Jesus Christ"" and ""We're down,"" seconds before the plane hurtled from the night sky into a house outside Buffalo, New York, in February. An investigator walks past the wreckage from a plane crash in Clarence Center, New York, in February. The last sounds heard in the cockpit were First Officer Rebecca Shaw saying ""We're"" and then screaming at 10:16 p.m. on February 12, according to a transcript of the cockpit recording. Seconds earlier, the pilot, Capt. Marvin Renslow, said, ""Jesus Christ,"" as a sound ""similar to stick shaker"" was heard, the transcript said. Renslow said, ""We're down,"" and a thump was heard before Shaw said, ""We're"" and screamed. The National Transportation Safety Board released the transcript of the cockpit recording on Tuesday as it began a three-day hearing in Washington on the crash.  See how crash of Flight 3407 unfolded » . Continental Connection Flight 3407, operated by regional carrier Colgan Air, plunged into a house in Clarence Center, New York, killing all 49 people on board and one man in the house. About five minutes before the crash, Shaw had shared with Renslow her fear of flying in icy conditions, according to the transcript. ""I don't want to have to experience that and make those kinds of calls. You know I'dve freaked out. I'dve [sic] had like seen this much ice and thought, 'oh my gosh, we were going to crash,"" Shaw told Renslow. The NTSB's preliminary investigation determined there was some ice accumulation on the Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 aircraft, but that ""icing had a minimal impact on the stall speed of the airplane."" Watch more on the NTSB investigation » . In a story Monday, the Wall Street Journal cited investigators as saying the crash resulted from pilot Marvin Renslow's incorrect response to the plane's precarious drop in speed: He overrode an emergency system known as a ""stick pusher,"" which sends the plane into a dive so it can regain speed and avoid a stall. Colgan Air, the operator of Continental Connection flights, said Monday that Renslow had never trained in a flight simulator with the safety system that activated just before the plane went down. Colgan said there is no regulatory requirement that it provide hands-on training with the ""stick pusher."" ""A stick pusher demonstrated in an aircraft simulator is not required by the FAA,"" the airline said in a statement. ""And thus was not included in Colgan's Q400 training program."" The Federal Aviation Administration said its standards do not require hands-on practice with the safety system. ""That's a significant problem,"" veteran pilot Douglas Moss told CNN. Moss, an expert in stall recovery, believes flight simulator practice with a stick pusher should be mandatory for aspiring pilots. ""It's similar to picking up and throwing a groundball in baseball. You can study it academically all you want to but you really need to develop the proficiency, the skill, the muscle memory required to do that,"" said Moss. Renslow had failed five pilot tests, known as ""check rides,"" three of which occurred before he joined the airline, Colgan Air said. Renslow had revealed only one of those failures to the airline, according to Colgan. NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said Tuesday that the board's hearing will not address who is to blame for the accident. ""Over the course of this hearing, we will continue to collect information that will assist the safety board in its examination of safety issues arising from this accident,"" he said. He said those issues are: airplane performance, cold weather operations, a sterile cockpit, flight crew training and performance, and fatigue management.

676,"(CNN)  -- Felipe Massa had emergency surgery for a fractured skull after a freak crash in final qualifying for Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix. Felipe Massa receives attention after his high-speed crash in Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying. The Brazilian careered off at the 200kph Turn Four at the Hungaroring after being hit in the helmet by flying debris from rear wing of the Brawn GP of compatriot Rubens Barrichello. 2008 championship runner-up Massa was stunned and lost control as his Ferrari flew into a tire wall at high speed. He was airlifted from the circuit to the AEK Hospital in Budapest and later underwent an emergency operation for the damage to his skull. Massa is in intensive care on a respirator and remains under observation in an induced coma. ""The condition of the driver is serious, but stable,"" said a hospital spokesman. After the frightening incident, Fernando Alonso claimed a surprising pole position in a chaotic end to Saturday's proceedings. The Massa accident happened at the end of the second qualifying session and the action was suspended while officials checked for debris. When the third and final qualifying session got underway it was Renault's Alonso clocked the fastest time of one minute 21.559 seconds. Sebastian Vettel, second in the title race to Jenson Button, will start alongside Alonso on the front row, with his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber qualifying third. Button was only eighth fastest with  Brawn GP teammate Barrichello 13th best, their worst qualifying performance of the season. Button delayed his final qualifying run while his car was checked out after the earlier incident. Reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton was fourth best for the improving McLaren team with Nico Rosberg in fifth for Williams. With the electronic timing system lost to the pit lane and the television coverage, former two-time world champion Alonso was at first unaware he had taken his first pole of the season. ""We have made a good step forward and the car did improve in the last two races. We are more competitive, but I don't think we are as quick as these two guys (referring to Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber),"" he said. ""We will try to win, but being honest and realistic, our target is to get some good points,"" added the Spaniard.","Felipe Massa suffers high-speed crash in qualifying for Hungarian Grand Prix .

677,"(CNN) -- A tractor-trailer slammed into a school bus driven by the mayor of a Louisiana town Friday morning, critically injuring two children. Twenty-one children -- ranging in age from 5 to 17 -- were on the St. Landry Parish school bus when it was hit while pulling back onto a highway in central Louisiana, Louisiana State Police said in a news release. Earlier Friday state police indicated that the crash left three children -- ages 5 and 15, plus one more whose age was unknown -- in critical condition. As of 5 p.m., Port Barre High School Principal William Duplechain said, 19 students had been treated and released from hospitals, and two remained in critical condition. They included a kindergarten student, who was unresponsive, according to the principal. The other was a middle-schooler who was placed in a medically induced coma so surgeons could operate on his broken leg. Gil Savoy, a substitute bus driver, was driving the students when the accident occurred, Port Barre Town Clerk Toria Comeaux said. Savoy is the mayor of Port Barre, a community of about 2,400 people some 30 miles north of Lafayette. He had pulled over on the side of U.S. 190 and, after all the students had boarded, began to slowly move forward ""with all of his warning devices still activated,"" according to Louisiana State Police. At that point, an 18-wheel truck driven by David Cox, 52, of Dallas, Texas, rammed into the bus from behind, police said. Comeaux said that the truck, which she was driving behind, had debris coming off it at the time of the crash. Both Savoy and Cox suffered minor injuries, with ""routine toxicology samples"" taken from both, the state police said. No one has been charged, and the investigation is ongoing. Video from CNN affiliates KLFY and KATC showed severe damage to the back of the bus and to the tractor-trailer's front. Anthony Standberry, a St. Landry Parish school board member, told KLFY that the speed limit on that stretch of U.S. 190 is 65 mph. He said he favors working with parents and school officials to remove all bus stops along major highways.

678,"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- What was Hurricane Karl weakened Friday to a tropical storm after making landfall, but the heavy rain it spawned could still cause mudslides and flash floods in the Mexican interior, forecasters said. Karl was downgraded after coming ashore as a Category 3 hurricane about 10 miles (15 kilometers) north of Veracruz, Mexico, CNN's satellite and radar estimates showed. The storm is forecast to weaken to a tropical depression later Friday or Saturday and dissipate over the mountains of Mexico on Sunday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Friday evening. It added the Mexican government has discontinued all coastal watches and warnings. The storm delivered torrents of rain and fierce winds several hours before it hit land around 11:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET). Photographs sent to CNN's iReport by Ricardo Arcaraz, who lives in Veracruz, showed heavy rain and trees on top of power lines. He reported widespread outages. Maximum sustained winds later weakened to around 70 mph (115 kph) with higher gusts, according to the Hurricane Center. Karl, located about 75 miles (115 kilometers) east of Puebla Mexico, was moving west-southwest at about 9 mph (15 kph), it said. Satellite images and surface observations from Mexico suggest Karl is weakening rapidly as it passes through steep mountains, the Hurricane Center added. High winds remain a threat, though forecasters said they will likely weaken too in the coming days. The homes of at least 3,000 families in central Mexico were damaged, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. ""Tropical storm force winds are occurring in a small area near the center. These winds will continue to spread inland along the track of the center tonight but should decrease rapidly as Karl weakens,"" the Hurricane Center said. Potentially dangerous rain also was forecast. ""Karl is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches across portions of south-central Mexico, with isolated amounts of 15 inches possible in the mountains,"" the center said. ""These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides."" Within the past day or so, some 8 inches of rain has fallen in Veracruz, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. Some local flooding was already reported, the Mexican Interior Ministry said. Officials closed some roads and urged evacuations for large, low-lying areas in Veracruz. Mexico's National System for Civil Protection issued a red alert, the highest level, for central and southern Veracruz. An orange alert was in place for northern Veracruz and the states of Hidalgo, Tlaxcala and Puebla. A yellow alert was issued for the states of Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosi and Oaxaca. Mexican President Felipe Calderon also sent a warning Friday morning on his Twitter account. ""An alert for Hurricane Karl in the nation's central states,"" it said, adding that Karl ""could convert to a Category 4. It will enter through Veracruz around midday."" Texas could be spared any major problems because a storm surge occurs only near the landfall location, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. Coastal flood advisories have been issued for south Texas, which means forecasters expect a small amount of coastal flooding but nothing serious, Morris said. A larger threat to south Texas will come from several inches of rain that could cause flooding and mudslides. The area could see as much as 4 inches by Sunday, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in far southern Texas.

679,"(CNN) -- They traded in their coveralls for suits, but many of the 33 miners who were trapped for 69 days in a gold and copper mine still sported their protective sunglasses when they appeared at the Chilean presidential palace Monday to accept awards for their ordeal. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera invited the miners, known as ""the 33,"" to a special ceremony in Santiago. The rescuers involved in the operation were also honored. The rescue earlier this month captured the attention of the world, as one by one the trapped miners were pulled to the surface in a custom-made capsule that was lowered through a hole drilled into the rock. The men survived underground for longer than anyone in history. ""If anybody doubted before this accident that faith moves mountains, if anybody doubted that when us Chileans get united we are capable of reaching great goals, if anybody doubted our ability to make great achievements, I think that your example has dissipated those doubts,"" Pinera said, referring to the miners. ""All of those doubts disappeared with what is known today as the Miracle of San Jose, which is the miracle of this story."" The miners have garnered much attentions since their rescue, and many of them still wore the $400 Oakley sunglasses they were given to protect their eyes as the exited the mine. Hundreds of people gathered outside of La Moneda, the presidential palace, and cheered the miners as they arrived. Some wore hard hats and waved flags and posters with the miners' photos. The successful rescue operation was seen as a boost to Chile's image. ""When we found out that the company working the mine didn't have the ability to do the proper search-and-rescue effort, we made a decision. The decision was to assume in its entirety 100 percent of the responsibility,"" Pinera said. The president continued, ""We searched for each one of you as if you were our children, finding you with the help of God, and rescuing you with the support and contribution of thousands upon thousands of heroes, some known, some others anonymously, who gave themselves entirely to the task while you were [trapped] in the depths of the mountain."" The rescue efforts were proof that Chile is committed to doing things right, the president said.

680,"(CNN) -- The world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, has escaped serious injury in a car crash in his native Jamaica which wrecked his high-speed sports car. Jamaican flyer Bolt claimed 100 meters gold in Beijing in a new world record time. The IAAF, the world governing body of athletics, gave graphic details of Bolt's lucky escape on its official Web site www.iaaf.org. The 22-year-old, who was driving his BMW M3 with two female passengers, lost control and went off a rain-soaked road. The car ended up overturned in a ditch and Bolt and his passengers had to clamber out through a bed of thorns before being taken to hospital in Spanish Town, near Kingston, as a precaution. Bolt was released after three hours, with his feet strapped with bandages, after undergoing a minor operation to remove embedded thorns from his foot. He told a local reporter: ""Me good man. Me all right, a just few cuts man, me all right."" As a result of the accident, Bolt will miss Saturday's Jamaica International Invitational meeting and is expected to be sidelined for at least a week. ""We will continue to monitor his progress over the next few days,"" Bolt's agent Ricky Simms told reporters. ""It's too early to say if this will have any impact on his training and racing program in the next few weeks."" Bolt is also set to come to England in mid-May to run in a special 150 meters street race in Manchester. A spokesman for the organizers told CNN that they were hopeful the sprint sensation would be fit to turn up. ""We are in constant contact with his management team and everything remains on track for him to come,"" said Norman Hart. Bolt set world records in winning the 100 and 200 meters gold in the Beijing OIympics and claimed a third gold as Jamaica took the 4x100 meters relay. He was given the BMW by his sponsors as reward for his incredible success which catapulted him to global stardom.","Sprinter Usain Bolt fortunate to escape from car crash in his native Jamaica .

681,"(CNN) -- After his plane ripped into pieces as it crashed Sunday night in a Utah neighborhood, the pilot was found burned and banged up but coherent, according to a witness. The Cessna 210 single-engine plane went down shortly before 6 p.m. in a residential area of Roy, Utah, according to Ogden police dispatcher Brittany Dean. The plane had been cleared for landing at nearby Ogden Airport when it crashed, said Mike Fergus of the Federal Aviation Administration. Gary Cox was in the neighborhood, attending a family birthday party, when the power went out right after the plane went down. He told CNN affiliate KSL that he and a few other people found a man, later identified as the pilot, lying on the ground. ""He was confused, hurt and in a lot of pain,"" Cox said. ""But he was able to answer questions and get where he needed to be."" The plane's engine sat in the front yard of a house, Cox said, with other parts strewn throughout the neighborhood. Roy fire Chief John Ritchie told KSL that the pilot was talking when he was transported to a local hospital, where he was in critical condition Sunday night. Two occupied homes -- one with three people inside, the other with two -- caught fire after the crash, Ritchie said. But no one inside was hurt and, within about an hour, firefighters were able to put out the fires. The crash knocked out power for 1,700 homes, starting at 5:58 p.m., said Margaret Oler of Rocky Mountain Power. By 7:10 p.m., power had been restored to all but 875 customers. A nearby elementary school was opened as a temporary shelter for those without heat and lights, Ritchie said. Visibility was minimal at the time of the crash, as the National Weather Service had issued a dense fog advisory for the area. That warning remains in effect until 9 a.m. Monday. Roy is about 6 miles southwest of Ogden, with the affected neighborhood near Ogden-Hinckley Airport. CNN's Greg Morrison and Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","NEW: Power has been restored to all but 875 of 1,700 homes .

682,"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Tomas continued to lose brawn in the Caribbean Sea on Monday morning after pummeling the island of St. Vincent over the weekend, the National Hurricane Center said. As of 5 a.m. ET Sunday, Tomas, a tropical storm with sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph),  was located about 135 miles (220 kilometers) northeast of Curacao, according to the Hurricane Center. The storm was moving west at about 14 mph (22 kph). Tropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 175 miles (280 kilometers) from the center of Tomas. Tomas moved over the Caribbean Sea after leaving heavy rain and wind on St. Vincent. More than 1,000 people entered shelters on St. Vincent as Tomas struck the island, an emergency official said. Two people were injured, including one critically, when they tried to repair roof damage during the storm, said Michelle Forbes, acting director of National Emergency Management. Tomas also left downed trees that blocked many roads, Forbes said, and large areas of the island lacked power. More than 100 homes sustained roof damage, she said, and authorities expected the number to rise. The main hospital on the island, Milton Cato Memorial Hospital, lost power temporarily but was able to get a generator up and running, according to Forbes. Tomas was forecast to continue heading west over the next day or two. The Hurricane Center said restrengthening could begin by late Tuesday. A projection map shows the storm turning north later this week. Tomas could approach Haiti on Friday, possibly as a hurricane. Tomas could deal a harsh blow to Haiti as the impoverished nation is still recovering from a devastating earthquake in January and is currently dealing with a cholera outbreak. But ""Tomas could still hit anywhere from the Dominican Republic to eastern Cuba,"" CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said.

683,"Monai, Indonesia (CNN) -- Saluhu stares at the mass grave where his youngest son is buried. He struggles to comprehend the split second that changed his life forever. He relives the moment he started to run inland with his family after feeling Monday's earthquake and hearing the distant roar of the tsunami. ""My youngest son's hand slipped out of my wife's hand when the tsunami hit us. It just slipped,"" Saluhu says. ""We didn't know where he was. We couldn't see a thing -- it was pitch black."" Nine-year-old Warisman is one of 30 victims in the village of Monai on the Indonesian island of South Pagai, one of the areas worst hit by the tsunami. Most of those who died had run into the village church, around 350 meters inland, thinking it was far enough. It wasn't. All that remains of the church are the foundations and small pieces of concrete and steel, ripped apart as if it were paper. The villagers tell us the tsunami hit approximately six minutes after they first felt the earthquake. For some it simply wasn't enough time to flee to higher ground. It's hard to overstate how remote these Indonesian islands are. Aid agencies are struggling to reach them, and harsh weather and torrential rain kept one aid ship out at sea for 16 hours before it was safe to dock near the devastated area. The Monai villagers say an aid helicopter dropped rice and water to them Thursday, but a CNN crew was the first to actually land there. Their food is almost completely gone.

684,"(CNN) -- Bad weather forced NASA to delay the launch of Space Shuttle Discovery by at least a day Thursday. Mission managers will meet Friday at 5 a.m. ET to re-evaluate weather conditions, NASA said. It was the latest in a series of delays for the 39th and final voyage for Discovery, the agency's oldest shuttle. Discovery's six crew members were scheduled to deliver a pressurized logistics module that will help provide more storage to the space station. ""We've gotten into a configuration now on the space station where we have a lot of stuff and we don't have a lot of space to put it in,"" said Royce Renfrew, lead space station flight director for the mission. The latest launch attempt had been set for Thursday afternoon. Before that, it was expected to blast off Monday, but Discovery was delayed to repair helium and nitrogen leaks in its system. A planned Tuesday liftoff was canceled so engineers could fix a glitch to a backup system that controls a main engine. With 38 voyages to date, Discovery has flown more missions than any other orbiter in the fleet. It also made history along the way, NASA said. Discovery flew the first female shuttle pilot, the first African-American spacewalker and the first sitting member of Congress to go to space.

685,"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Police who are investigating a major wildfire in northern Israel have detained a 14-year-old boy who admitted smoking a water pipe in the woods near his village, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. The wildfire killed at least 42 people and forced the evacuation of thousands of others before it was extinguished Monday, police said. The boy said he threw coals from his pipe in the woods, but then panicked and ran to school after the fire started. Two other teenagers who had been detained Monday have been released, Rosenfeld said. About 1,500 firefighters are still in the area and on standby, police spokesman Rosenfeld said. The fire, which broke out Thursday, forced the evacuations of about 17,000 people and scorched over 10,000 acres around Haifa, Israel's third largest city, threatening businesses, tourism and one of Israel's greenest regions, Mount Carmel. The developments came a day after the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to speed aid to those affected. ""I do not want delays,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. ""I do not want bureaucracy. I want processes to be shortened. I want quick solutions. I want all of the people -- within days -- to be able to return to their homes or to alternative housing, until the reconstruction work is finished."" The Cabinet has approved a series of steps aimed at kick-starting a quick response for victims. The Finance Ministry will allocate 60 million shekels ($16 million) in aid to local communities affected by the fire. Netanyahu instructed that more funding be considered if necessary. The plan will include compensating local governments for damages ""in order to meet the costs of evacuating and absorbing populations, firefighting efforts, clean-up and dealing with infrastructures,"" according to a government statement. The government said Israel's Housing Administration will station mobile structures in the communities to stand in for homes and public structures that were destroyed. A plan will also be formulated to restore animal and plant life affected in the Carmel Nature Reserve. Most of the 42 victims were cadets in Israel's prison service who arrived Thursday to help evacuate 500 inmates from the Damon prison near Haifa. Among the dead, 40 were apparently burned alive when their bus, traveling along a narrow mountain road, was engulfed by the fast-moving blaze, the Jerusalem Post reported. Police said late Monday that a policewoman had died of her wounds, bringing the death toll to 42. In an interview with the newspaper, a firefighter spokesman said the bus was gone in less than three minutes. ""The bus had no chance. They tried to escape but were burned alive,"" the spokesman said. ""It was a horrific scene."" The Israeli military said the victims would be buried with full honors in military ceremonies. Built on the slopes of Mount Carmel about 50 miles north of Tel Aviv, Haifa's metropolitan area is also host to historical sites that date to Biblical times. The fire has also threatened a sensitive ecological area near the Hai Bar nature reserve. Known as Mount Carmel's ""Little Switzerland,"" the reserve is home to a wildlife preservation project that seeks to bring back native species mentioned in the Old Testament.

686,"Washington (CNN) -- A malfunctioning launch control center for a portion of the nation's nuclear missiles remained offline Wednesday as investigations continued into a weekend computer problem that disrupted communications with more than 10 percent of America's land-based nuclear missiles. Early indications are that Saturday's disruption to one of the launch control centers linked to Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming lasted longer than an hour, Lt. Col. John Thomas said. The problem appears to be very similar to glitches at two other nuclear missile sites in the late 1990s. The United States has 450 land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles in its nuclear arsenal. The 50 Minuteman III missiles involved in Saturday's incident are all currently at ""normal operating capability,"" said Thomas, the director of public affairs for the Air Force's Global Strike Command. But while those missiles are typically controlled by five underground launch control centers, only four are currently online, he added. The fifth control center remains offline and is believed to be the source of a computer hardware problem that caused a communications disruption Saturday. It has been electronically isolated from the launch system while the problem is investigated and solved, Thomas said. It's not unusual for a missile squadron to take one of its five launch control centers out of service to perform maintenance, Thomas explained. In fact, he said, an entire squadron of missiles can be controlled by just one control center or even from a command aircraft flying nearby. Thomas said that as soon as computer messages started telling the squadron commanders at Warren Air Force Base that a problem existed over the weekend, closed-circuit television security cameras were used to check each silo and make sure no obvious problems existed. Then, Air Force personnel from Warren were sent to all 50 silos, in a ""not insignificant effort,"" to visually inspect them and make sure they were secure. Some of the missile silos are hundreds of miles from the base. The investigation is still going on, Thomas said, but early indications are that a computer component on the fifth launch control center continually tried to communicate with the missiles in the silos when it wasn't supposed to. He compared it to five people with walkie-talkies and one of them sitting on the button, making it impossible for the other four to use theirs. Once the fifth launch control center was isolated, the other four established communications with all 50 missiles, and the squadron was back to normal, Thomas explained. The process of isolating the problem and getting the other control centers linked back to the missiles took more than an hour, he said. Because of redundancies in the nuclear force, several military officials have said, the president always had the ability to order the missiles to launch. As for the cause, Thomas said it appears the computer hardware problem is very similar to problems in the late 1990s at the two other Air Force bases that control America's intercontinental ballistic missile forces: Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and Malstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The circumstances of those incidents were much like what happened at the Warren base, he said. The Air Force and Strategic Command, which would take charge of the missiles if the president were ready to launch them, is investigating the incident. Thomas said that right now, investigators are ""not ruling anything out."" But he said there is ""no indication of intentional of malicious activity.""

687,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The death toll from a plane crash Sunday in Karachi, Pakistan, rose to 12 after an official confirmed the deaths of four people who were on the ground. The four laborers were sleeping in an under-construction building that the plane crashed into, said Pervez George, a spokesman for Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority. Additionally, a man on a motorcycle was critically injured when the plane crashed, George said. The plane crashed early Sunday in the southern port city, killing eight Russian nationals on board and sending flames shooting through the sky, a Pakistani official said. The cargo plane took off at 1:45 a.m. (3:45 p.m. Saturday ET) from the Jinnah Karachi International Airport for Khartoum, Sudan, and went down a few minutes later in the Gulistan-e Johar section of Karachi, an area where many Pakistani naval officers live. The plane appeared to hit several buildings that were under construction. The pilot appeared to deliberately bring the plane down in a less densely populated residential area in order to save lives, . Masood Raza, a Karachi district government official, told CNN affiliate GEO News in Pakistan. ""If the plane would have crashed in a (more crowded) residential area, it would have been a very big disaster for the city of Karachi,"" Raza said. The Russian-made cargo plane was carrying relief supplies, including tents, to Africa before it went down. The plane arrived in Karachi on Saturday from Fujairah, United Arab Emirates, George said. A witness told CNN that he saw fire on one of the plane's wings before it crashed. Firefighters, rescue personnel and area residents rushed to the scene, with jet fuel fanning the large flames and huge plumes of smoke. The blaze was put out by 4 a.m., according to George, but rescue personnel continued to comb through the rubble looking for other people possibly killed or hurt. Bystander Mohammed Raees told GEO News that he was injured after flaming parts of a building hit him and the motorcyle he was preparing to ride. Hospital sources told the CNN affiliate that Raees had burns over 60 percent of his body.","Four workers on the ground were killed in the crash .

688,"(CNN) -- The Panama Canal reopened Thursday after heavy rains and flooding prompted its closing for only the third time in its storied 96-year history. Officials closed the canal around noon Wednesday after heavy rain in the Chagres River area, caused water behind the Gatun Dam -- which creates Lake Gatun, a significant part of the canal -- to rise. The canal was reopened 17 hours later. The last time the canal closed was in 1989, after the United States invaded Panama to topple strongman Manuel Noriega. Landslides forced the canal to close for several months from late 1915 to mid-1916, just months after it opened. The 48-mile canal is a key conduit for shipping between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The canal was built from 1904 to 1914 by the United States, which had sole control over the channel across the Panamanian isthmus until 1979. Then, after 20 years of joint U.S.-Panama control, the Panamanian government assumed administration on December 31, 1999.","Panama Canal reopens after heavy rains and flooding .

689,"Saugus, Massachusetts (CNN) -- The image is still vivid after 65 years. Bob Attubato and his fellow sixth-grade classmates rushed to the window just in time to see a crippled twin-engine bomber trailing smoke and flames over their school. ""Suddenly, we heard this unearthly sound coming over the school,"" Attubato recalled. ""It just reverberated through the building."" As the class stood there and watched, the plane's wing and engine broke off and it disappeared from view.  A loud explosion followed. Attubato later learned that the pilot, Army Air Force Maj. Doak Weston stayed with the B-25 until it crashed on a nearby golf course, giving his five-man crew time to bail out and missing nearby homes. The event faded with time, but Attubato never forgot that day. He and others campaigned to honor the heroic pilot. One of these was Dave Paquin, whose father was one of the surviving crew members. Sgt. Frederic Paquin  parachuted from the burning plane that day, landing in a tree. Dave Paquin said his father used to joke about that being the only tree he climbed down that he never climbed up. Paquin's father died 15 years ago, but he still feels a debt of gratitude to Weston. ""My father owes his life to him,"" he said. Recently, the mayor of Melrose, Massachusetts -- where Weston's plane crashed on the golf course -- agreed to honor the pilot's heroism. ""In Massachusetts, we have many great historic events and some for whatever reason just get passed by,"" Melrose Mayor Robert Dolan said. ""I just couldn't imagine that this individual doesn't have some remembrance for what he has done."" On September 24, 2010 -- 65 years to the day of the accident -- the city held a ceremony on the eighth tee at the Mt. Hood Golf Club in Melrose, overlooking the site of the crash. Aside from the occasional golf cart passing by, it is a quiet, peaceful spot. At the conclusion of the service, Dolan lifted a sheet off a small stone engraved with the names of Weston and the crew he saved. Helping him to unveil the monument was Michael Weston, who was only 3 when his father died. He was overwhelmed by the city's gratitude. ""I'm just very impressed,"" he said. ""It's just made me very happy."" Weston traveled with his family from California to attend the service. Until coming to Melrose, he said, they never had a full appreciation of what Doak Weston had done or what his sacrifice meant to this community. Weston graciously accepted the thanks given to him by the veterans and residents who lined up after the service to shake his hand. He said he knows their gratefulness is really directed at his father. They want to honor the memory of a man who gave his life for others. Michael Weston has the same feelings towards the father he never really knew. ""There are lots of people who follow that instinct to do the right thing for their fellow man,"" he said.  ""That's what he stood for to me.""","Maj. Doak Weston piloted a B-25 as it went down north of Boston, Massachusetts .

690,"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- An oil pipeline struck by an explosion in a volatile region of southern Yemen Tuesday is operated by a South Korean company, Yonhap news agency reported, citing local authorities and company officials. Officials believe attackers might have carried out a strike that caused a leak in the 204-kilometer pipeline operated by the state-owned Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC). The blast took place in an oil field in Shabwa province that produces 10,000 barrels of oil a day, the agency reported. Explosives were found near the site and news reports are linking al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to the incident. Yonhap says KNOC has been developing oil fields on four sites in Yemen since 2007, and the Korean Embassy in Yemen says it is working with local authorities to come up with a cause of the blast. U.S. officials believe that AQAP is behind the recent plot to send bombs from Yemen to the United States and the pipeline incident comes as troops attempt to capture U.S.-born militant Anwar al-Awlaki in the Shabwa region. The group is based in Yemen, which has emerged as a major operating base for al Qaeda and other terror groups. Yemeni authorities are intensifying operations to capture U.S.-born al-Awlaki, according to a senior Yemeni government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Al-Awlaki -- who has not been linked to the recent plot -- is regarded by the United States as a terrorist and propagandist who has become an important operational figure within AQAP. U.S. officials have confirmed that he is on a CIA and military hit list to be captured or killed.","The incident occurred in Shabwa province .

691,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Deaths in Indonesia mounted on Saturday from the volcanic eruption spewing scorching ash and gas, and the country's leader is stationed near the scene to coordinate relief efforts. At least 81 people are now dead after the powerful Friday eruption at Mount Merapi, in Central Java, bringing the total number of deaths to about 120 people since the volcano began erupting October 26, hospital officials said. Friday's flare-up is being called Merapi's largest so far, unleashing ash clouds and gas that have reached villages in areas many thought were safe from the volcano's eruptions. Volcanic ash has also hindered air travels with delays, cancellations and altered flight paths. International airlines have canceled at least 50 flights on Saturday from the capital, Jakarta, about 280 miles away from the volcano. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has temporarily moved to the nearby big city of Yogyakarta to help direct relief operations. ""Our burn unit has been working overtime to handle the volcano's victims,"" Banu Hermawan, a spokesman for Dr. Sardjito Hospital in Yogyakarta. ""The forensic team is also working hard to identified bodies with severe burns."" Another hospital official said only 11 people have been identified because many of the victims were severely burned. Yudhoyono has instructed the military to assist relief efforts by building facilities and field hospitals in the area. He has also ordered the Coordinating Ministry for People's Welfare, which oversees several ministries, to coordinate faster and more efficient relief. The president announced that residents will receive compensation for livelihoods and animals lost to the eruptions. The government will buy endangered cows on the volcano, he said. Many of those who live on its slopes raise cattle and risked their lives by staying or returning to feed their cows. The children's charity Plan International has launched an appeal to help 20,000 people fleeing the mountain. ""People were fleeing in panic and only have what they could carry,"" said Nono Sumarsono, acting country director of Plan International, said Friday. He said there is an urgent need for food, water, mats, blankets and hygiene kits -- items that the group is already distributing. Workers are also in the process of getting emergency latrines and setting up temporary schools for children. Mathias Eick, regional information officer with the European Commission's humanitarian aid department, said Friday that many residents were expecting a minor outbreak, but the eruptions had become much worse. Lava balls have rained down on villages and houses have burned, Eick said. Streets and cars are covered in ash, and people are wearing face masks. ""This is a major humanitarian crisis,"" he said. Merapi continues to spill hot ash cloud and rumbles consistently, according to data from the Indonesian Volcanology Technology Development and Assessment Agency. The data also indicates the hot ash cloud that hit a village near the crater was around 450-600 degrees Celsius (842-1,112 degrees Fahrenheit). The 3,000-meter (9,800-foot) Merapi is famously unpredictable. An eruption killed two people in 2006 and another killed more than 60 villagers in 1994. About 1,300 people died when Merapi erupted in 1930. In addition, last week a 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia's coast, triggering a tsunami and killing at least 449 people. Hundreds more were injured. CNN's Kathy Quiano and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","The president is directing relief in Yogyakarta .

692,"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- A cholera outbreak in Haiti continues to spread to previously unaffected areas in rural communities, killing 442 people and hospitalizing 6,742 others, the Pan American Health Organization said Wednesday. Health authorities are concerned that the situation may worsen as Tropical Storm Tomas approaches the impoverished nation, still recovering from a devastating January earthquake that killed 250,000 people and left 1 million homeless. Tomas is projected to pass over Haiti on Friday. Health officials set up six cholera treatment centers in Port-au-Prince, the nation's capital. Four of the centers are fully operational, the Pan American Health Organization said. Four more are planned. Officials hope to create 2,000 beds in the treatment centers, the health agency said. In addition, the agency said, cholera treatment tents will be established at 14 hospitals in Port-au-Prince as soon as Tomas clears the island nation. Cholera is an intestinal infection caused by ingestion of bacteria-contaminated food or water. The infection causes watery diarrhea and vomiting, which can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if not treated promptly. About 80 percent of cases can be cured by rehydrating the patient, the Pan American Health Organization said. The disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world, particularly in developing countries. There are an estimated 3 million to 5 million cholera cases and 100,000 to 120,000 deaths every year worldwide, the health agency said.","NEW: Cholera causes up to 120,000 deaths worldwide every year .

693,"(CNN) -- An Illinois woman walked away from a car crash that killed her husband, authorities believe, but they have found no trace of her other than footprints in the snow leading to a road. A search was in its third day Tuesday for Tanya Shannon, 40, of Ransom, Illinois, according to the LaSalle County, Illinois, Sheriff's Office. Ground operations began at 9 a.m. with air operations starting at noon, Sheriff Tom Templeton said. ""They're looking,"" he told CNN sister network HLN. ""They're expanding their search area just a little."" Shannon was last seen along with her husband Dale Shannon, 41, at a Christmas party Saturday night in Streator, about 17 miles west of Ransom, relatives told CNN affiliate WGN and the Chicago Tribune. ""They were dancing together, really cutting up a rug,"" Dale Shannon's sister Donna Baker, who was at the party, told the Tribune. She said the couple -- married 20 years with four daughters ages 4 to 15 -- left the party arm in arm. Her brother was sober, she told the newspaper, and was driving his wife's car. About 1:45 a.m. Sunday, a deputy on patrol in a rural area of Brookfield Township found a one-car traffic accident, the sheriff's office said in a statement. ""The deputy found a male occupant of the vehicle in the driver's seat deceased,"" the statement said. ""Evidence at the scene indicated that a second person was also in the vehicle at the time of the accident. Further investigation revealed that the second person was possibly the wife of the deceased driver."" The car slid backwards into a pole, Templeton said, with enough force to break the backs of both the front seats. A relative told the Tribune Dale Shannon's back was broken. Footprints were reportedly found leading from the car to a nearby road. But there, Tanya Shannon's trail ends. ""There's nothing for us to believe there's any issues other than exactly what happened, a traffic accident that claimed her husband's life, that she was at least able for a period of time to walk away from and move up to the roadway,"" the sheriff said. ""And once she was on the roadway, that's where we lost track of her."" He said he couldn't speculate on whether or how badly Tanya Shannon was injured in the crash. ""She was at least able to get up to the road,"" he said. Police have her cell phone, he said. Police have not ruled out the possibility that Tanya Shannon was picked up by someone. But ""if she was able to walk and able to move, how come she hasn't contacted any of her family?"" Templeton told WGN. Tanya Shannon was last seen wearing a red dress -- described by the Tribune as a ball gown -- and a gray fleece hooded jacket, police said. The dress should have made her easy to spot in the rural, snowy landscape. ""We were told from the family she was an extremely loving mother,"" Templeton told the Tribune. For her to just leave with no warning ""would be incredibly out of character,"" Templeton said. ""To be out in the elements as they were that night, dressed only as she was, it's very doubtful that you can survive terribly long."" The crash site was remote, Templeton told the newspaper. A nuclear power plant lies to the north, but the area is surrounded by farmland. ""It's crazy,"" Baker told WGN. ""We're holding on to every ounce of hope we have, just to hope for (a) safe return. ... It's been like a nightmare you can't wake up from. If anybody has anything, seen anything, please, please contact us, because these four girls need something."" Search and rescue operations have so far involved dogs and aircraft from the Illinois State Police, along with more than 50 searchers, according to WGN and the sheriff's office. Tanya Shannon is described as being 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighing 125 pounds, with shoulder-length strawberry-blond hair and green eyes, according to the sheriff's statement. She also wears glasses. It's very mysterious what might have happened to Tanya,"" Baker told the Tribune. ""We checked the area hospitals and nothing, so we don't know if someone picked her up and took her somewhere. We just don't know."" Templeton said he's never seen a case like this in his 12 years as sheriff. ""Anything that's even remotely close has been gone over several times,"" he told the newspaper. Anyone with information regarding Tanya Shannon's whereabouts is asked to contact the LaSalle County Sheriff's Office.

694,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A powerful car bomb exploded outside a regional television station in Spain's Basque region Wednesday after police got a warning call from the separatist group ETA, authorities said. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero says ETA is losing all the battles. The blast occurred in the city of Bilbao around 11 a.m. (5 a.m. ET). The warning came an hour ahead of the bombing and gave police enough time to evacuate the area, including some 500 people working at the government-run Basque regional TV, known by its initials EiTB, and in other nearby offices. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but the blast shattered the glass facade of the TV station's new headquarters. It was the first major attack blamed on ETA since police arrested two of its suspected top leaders recently. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States. Last month during an anti-terrorism raid in France, authorities captured the man then considered to be the overall chief of the Basque separatist group. Authorities said the suspect, Mikel Garikoitz Aspiazu, 35, alias ""Txeroki,"" was in charge of both ETA's military and political, or policymaking, wings. Just three weeks later, on December 8, police arrested Txeroki's alleged replacement, Aitzol Iriondo Yarza, 30, the new suspected head of the ETA commandos. He was also arrested in France, ETA's traditional rear guard base just across the border from Spain.  Watch the explosion » . After that, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said ETA was more ""isolated"" than ever and he ruled out fresh talks with them. ""The end of ETA can be seen only with the push from the rule of law,"" Zapatero said in an interview on December 18 with CNN affiliate Cuatro TV. He said police had arrested 365 ETA suspects in the past two years, notably the two recent suspected top ETA leaders and their alleged ETA chief predecessor, who was detained last May, also in France. On Wednesday after the Bilbao blast, Zapatero told an audience in southern Spain that ""ETA can attack but it is going to lose all the battles."" Top Spanish officials have repeatedly warned that ETA is not yet finished. An ETA communique during the autumn threatened many targets, including government-run media outlets. The previous major car bomb blamed on ETA was on October 30 at the University of Navarra in Pamplona, which injured 27 people and caused extensive damage. The Bilbao bomb comes two years after ETA's car bomb at Madrid's airport that killed two men and destroyed a parking garage. There are about 600 ETA convicts or suspects in Spanish jails and 150 others in French jails, authorities in the two countries have told CNN.","Bomb explodes outside a television station in Spain's Basque region .

695,"(CNN) -- Cold weather frosting much of the country spared Florida's citrus crop Tuesday, but more near-record lows expected overnight will pose another challenge. ""We came through last night in pretty good shape,"" said Andrew Meadows, a spokesman for Florida Citrus Mutual. ""We had some reports of mid-20s scattered across the citrus belt but it wasn't for any duration."" Fort Lauderdale recorded its lowest temperature on record for December 7, dropping to 40 degrees Tuesday morning. The old record was 42, set in 1841. The National Weather Service issued hard freeze warnings for Tuesday night into Wednesday morning for much of the Florida panhandle, with freeze warnings and watches extending as far south as Hollywood. Parts of Alabama and Georgia were also under a freeze warning. Meanwhile, parts of North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Vermont were under winter weather warnings Tuesday for additional snow. Some areas have already received as much as a foot of snow. At least one death was blamed on the cold in South Carolina. In Marion County, the coroner said Tuesday that a 47-year-old man found dead Monday outside a home in Mullins apparently died of hypothermia. The unusually early cold weather is the result of a blocking pattern over the Atlantic Ocean that is helping to allow freezing air from Canada to flow into the eastern half of the country, said CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""Basically, the cold weather pattern is going to remain for the next two weeks,"" he said. ""There will be a couple of days where it will warm up before we get the next surge of cold."" The sprawling system has dumped snow from Minnesota east to Virginia, with more expected Tuesday and Wednesday. While nothing as drastic as snow is forecast for Florida, the prospect of another near-freezing night had Salvation Army officials in Fort Lauderdale preparing for twice as many homeless people to make use of their shelter. ""The first cold night, not so many come in,"" said Sally Gress, director of development for the Salvation Army office in Fort Lauderdale. ""We're expecting about 100 as people realize how cold it is. It's cold and it's getting colder."" In Coral Springs on Florida's west coast, Michigan resident Rob Brown was reveling in what he considered to be warm weather as he worked in a long-sleeved T-shirt at the family Christmas tree stand. For the past 15 years, Brown's family has cut trees from their farm in Greenville, Michigan, to sell in south Florida. ""You work, you don't break a sweat,"" he said of the weather. But his customers aren't so fond of the conditions, he said. ""The colder weather definitely does put them more in the Christmas spirit, but I think it's too cold for them. They wake up in the morning and it's 35 degrees and they think it's the end of the world,"" he said. Although the chilly temperatures left the Deep South shivering, the upper Plains states were bearing the brunt of the cold snap. Overnight lows in parts of Montana and North Dakota dipped into negative territory Tuesday morning, and they bottomed out in the teens across broad areas of the Upper Midwest. ""We had above-normal temperatures for much of the fall and I think this is the first really good winter outbreak of the year and people just aren't really used to it,"" according to Brian Korty of the National Weather Service, who said there may be a silver lining to the early cold. ""Usually when you get a very cold December across the eastern part of the country, usually the pattern flips and very often you will see a warm January and February.""

696,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 63 people were killed and 285 others were wounded in a series of explosions across the capital Tuesday, police said. The blasts included 14 car bombs, two roadside bombs and mortar attacks in at least 17 neighborhoods of the capital, most of them in Shiite neighborhoods, police said. In an earlier report, police said there had been three roadside bombs and a sticky bomb: a device typically placed on a vehicle. Explosions struck the Shiite neighborhoods of Kadhimiya in the northwest; Amil, Bayaa and Shulaa in the southwest; Ur and Zuhour in the northeast; Sadr City, Kamaliya and Amin in the east; and Abu Dhsir in the southern part of the city. Other blasts struck mixed Sunni-Shiite neighborhoods, including Waziriya, Yarmouk, Jihad and Eghraiat. ""We are aware of multiple explosions in the Baghdad area with resultant casualties,"" the U.S. military said in response to a query from CNN. ""At this time, no request for [U.S. Forces - Iraq] support has been made but we are providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance coverage over some of the explosion sites."" A U.S. military spokesman, Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, said the strikes are typical of al Qaeda in Iraq attacks. During the height of the Iraq war, sectarian violence tore through Baghdad on a daily basis in Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods. Also Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists protested Iraq's move -- carried out Monday -- to close Al-Baghdadiya TV's offices in Baghdad and Basra. The decision came after the Cairo, Egypt-based satellite channel broadcast demands of gunmen who attacked a church in Baghdad on Sunday. The hours-long standoff ended after Iraqi security forces stormed the Sayidat al-Nejat church. In all, 58 people died, and 75 others were wounded; most of the casualties were women and children, the officials added. The Al-Baghdadiya bureau chief in Cairo, Abdelhamid al-Saih, told the journalists group that the shutdown was illegal since there was no judicial order and that he believed authorities were using the broadcast as a pretext to close the offices because the channel had previously given Iraqis the opportunity to criticize the government. ""We are concerned by the closure of Al-Baghdadiya TV and demand that [the government's Communications and Media Commission] explain under what authority it has stormed the station's offices and censored it,"" said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""We call on the authorities to allow the station to resume its operations immediately."" According to the committee, the government commission said in a statement that the attackers had ""contacted the station and selected it to be the exclusive platform for their inhumane practices with the purpose of disrupting Iraq's national unity and to inflame religious discord."" It said, ""the station's broadcast of demands 'amounts to incitement to violence' and that Al-Baghdadia's coverage was not objective, creating a threat to the military operation by providing attackers with information about ongoing operations to rescue the hostages.""

698,"(CNN) -- A Qantas passenger jet landed safely in Singapore on Friday after turning back due to engine problems shortly after takeoff, Australian Transport Safety Bureau spokesman Neville Blyth told CNN. ""I saw flames five minutes into flight and we could see flames through the left-side window,"" said passenger Terence Sim. It is the second Qantas jet in two days to return to Singapore as a result of engine trouble. In Friday's incident, the Boeing 747-400 was carrying 412 passengers and 19 crew members and was headed to Sydney, Australia, according to a Qantas spokesman, who would not provide his name, citing company policy. On Thursday, a Qantas Airbus A380 jet made an emergency landing at Changi Airport after one of its four engines shut down as it started a flight to Sydney.  As the plane headed back to the airport, part of the engine's covering, or cowling, tore off. Airbus announced Friday that it asked all operators of A380s with Rolls-Royce engines to inspect them as a precaution. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau says it has deployed investigators to examine the cause of Thursday's engine failure on the Airbus A380 and is currently gathering more information regarding Friday's incident. None of the passengers aboard the Boeing 747-400 also had been aboard the Airbus A380, according to the Qantas spokesman.","NEW: Passenger says he saw flames outside the jet's left-side window .

699,"(CNN) -- An Antarctic cruise ship was under way again Wednesday after spending a day slowed by electrical malfunctions in rough weather and crashing cold waves, the organization that promotes the southernmost cruises said. The MV Clelia II was making its way northbound back to Argentina Tuesday when a large wave crashed over the 290-foot ship, ""breaking the starboard bridge window and dousing some electrical circuitry,"" the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators said. ""This caused a temporary loss of communications and affected engine performance,"" the organization said. ""Both engines remained operational and speed was reduced."" No passengers were injured, but a member of the crew suffered minor injuries, the group said. Another Antarctic cruise ship, the National Geographic Explorer, stayed with the Clelia II while repairs were made, and the ship resumed its journey across the Drake Passage when the repairs were complete. The association said all 88 of the Clelia's passengers were Americans and that most of the ship's 77 crew members were Filipinos.

700,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A firefighter who was trapped in a fast-moving forest fire in eastern Spain Tuesday and hospitalized with severe burns, died Friday near Barcelona, the Catalan regional government said on its Web site. Spain is plagued by forest fires every summer, when dry weather sets in along with high temperatures. He was the sixth firefighter this week to die from forest fires raging around Spain. The 31-year-old man was with a group of firefighters battling a forest fire in Horta de Sant Joan in eastern Tarragona province Tuesday, when winds suddenly shifted, trapping them. Four firefighters in the group were killed immediately, authorities said, while several others were injured. The 31-year-old firefighter, who worked for the regional Catalan government, had burns on more than 50 percent of his body. The Horta de Sant Joan fire was brought under control midday Friday, the Catalan government said, after burning 1,020 hectares, or 2,520 acres. On Thursday, a 44-year-old firefighter died while driving a fire truck to fight a forest fire in eastern Teruel province, the regional Aragon government said on its Web site. The Aragon region borders the Catalan region. Some 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) have already burned in Teruel province and Friday there were still various fronts to the fire, CNN partner station CNN+ reported, from the scene. Aircraft, including planes and helicopters, were being used to fight the fires in the Aragon region, along with hundreds of firefighters in the hilly terrain, much of it with difficult access. On Thursday, more than 800 Spanish troops were also fighting numerous forest fires across Spain, the Environment Ministry said. Spanish media reported that a fire in the town of Mojacar, in southern Almeria province, forced the Thursday night evacuation of 3,000 people. Spain is plagued by forest and brush fires every summer, when extremely dry weather sets in along with high temperatures. In 2005, 11 people were killed when they were trapped by a fast-moving fire in Guadalajara province, east of Madrid.

701,"(CNN) -- Jeff Peterson and his 30 volunteer comrades with the Community Fire Department in suburban Charlotte, North Carolina, were enjoying an early Christmas dinner Sunday afternoon when someone looked out a window and saw smoke, thinking it might be a car fire. A few donned gear as others rushed outside the North Belmont station house to find it was an SUV that had struck a tree. Video taken at the scene showed flames shooting out of the engine compartment and the driver's white door blackened from the fire. Local resident Kathy Lamberth apparently had lost control of the Suburban, CNN affiliate WSOC reported. ""You couldn't see in the vehicle,"" which was about 35 yards from the station, Peterson, 36, told HLN on Wednesday. Within moments, Peterson and fellow paramedic Neil Jones, along with firefighter/EMT Jake Beatty, found the doors were jammed. They opened the rear swinging doors of the vehicle and saw Lamberth, whose seat had been pushed back by the impact, trying to reach her 3-week-old son, Landen. ""We knew while it was an urgent situation we could make the rescue without harming ourselves,"" said Peterson, who provided aid to the mother and son after Jones and Beatty brought them out of the burning vehicle. ""I thought as long as he made it I was happy,"" Lamberth said, referring to her son. Landen did not suffer injuries, WSOC said. Lamberth, 23, who was treated at a hospital and released, had gratitude for the firefighters. ""They were our guardian angels,"" she said. Officials credit part of the quick response to the fact they had gathered for the meal. ""We were miraculously all there for dinner,"" Peterson said.

702,"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Pivotal elections will proceed as planned in Haiti despite the cholera outbreak that has now sickened more than 60,000 people and threatens to keep spreading. The death toll now stands at 1,415, the Ministry of Public Health and Population reported Wednesday, citing data collected as of November 20. More than 25,000 people have been hospitalized. Some of the 19 presidential candidates have urged a postponement of Sunday's vote. But Ken Merten, the United States ambassador to Haiti, said the election process was on track. He said 250,000 new voters were registered and more than 11,000 voting stations have been identified in the fifth presidential election since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship and the first key moment at the polls since the devastating earthquake in January. ""We have a cholera problem here, which is something that the Haitians and we are all grappling with, which is a major public health challenge here,"" Merten said at a news conference Tuesday. ""And we have the elections which should take place, need to take place, and we are here to support that effort."" Meanwhile, the Pan American Health Organization said it was planning to treat 400,000 cholera cases within the next year, up from a previous estimate of 270,000 over several years, as a result of the outbreak in Haiti. ""We need to plan for up to half of those cases occurring in the next three months because of the explosive nature of this epidemic,"" the organization's deputy director, Dr. Jon Kim Andrus, told reporters in Washington on Tuesday. ""We need more of everything,"" he said. ""More training for staff in Haiti, more doctors, more nurses, more treatment centers, more medications, more toilets, more clean water.""

703,"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- More than 4,000 people were isolated by flood waters and as many as 1,800 have been evacuated in the Australian state of New South Wales after a week of heavy rains, the government said Monday. As a result of this week's rains, the government has so far issued disaster declarations in 17 of the state's rural and suburban districts, predominantly in the south and west. They join 17 other districts declared disaster areas after flooding in October. The flooding, which is expected to continue as a new storm front is forecast to bring extended heavy rains through Friday, has already destroyed an estimated $500 million in crops in the region, according to a statement issued by New South Wales Emergency Services. The hardest-hit communities include Wagga Wagga and Coonamble, both located in the southern part of North South Wales, which is located in Australia's southeast. The community of North Wagga Wagga was completely isolated on Monday, the emergency services agency said. Some evacuated residents of Eastern Coonamble have been allowed to return to their homes, although the government warned further flooding expected from the rains forecast for later this week could renew the danger. Flood warnings remained in effect Monday for communities along 13 rivers in New South Wales, including Castlereagh River, MacQuarie River and Murrumbidgee River. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology issued a flood watch Monday for northwest, southwest and central New South Wales, warning that another significant storm approaching the region could cause additional flooding. Since the most recent flooding began Nov. 29, emergency workers have executed 67 flood rescues and received more than 1,300 requests for assistance, the emergency services agency said. Most of the requests involved damage caused by flash flooding.","Heavy rains this week have resulted in major flooding in parts of New South Wales .

704,"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Already devastated this year by a killer earthquake and a deadly cholera outbreak, Haiti felt the brute force Friday of Hurricane Tomas, which could dump up to 15 inches of rain and trigger flash floods and mudslides. The hurricane's punishing rain continued to pound Haiti even as the storm churned away from Hispaniola. As of 8 p.m. ET, the storm's center was about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east of Guantanamo, Cuba, and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Great Inagua island in the Bahamas, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. Earlier Friday, Tomas had passed within about 140 miles (230 kilometers) of Port-au-Prince. In the westernmost tip of Haiti, which juts into the Caribbean Sea and is closest to the hurricane, there were reports from the town of Jeremie of destroyed houses, downed trees and flooded rivers, said Francois Desruisseaux, an emergency team leader with CARE in Haiti. Also, he said, CARE workers near the coastal city of Leogane reported the area has been inundated with several feet of water. Downtown streets turned into rivers, said Desruisseaux. Tomas was also felt in Port-au-Prince, the nation's capital, but the worst of the storm appeared to have passed there after rain pounded the city overnight. By Friday afternoon, rain had stopped falling. It started again in fits and spurts later. ""We were expecting something perhaps a little larger, but it's still quite significant,"" Desruisseaux said about Hurricane Tomas, adding that rescue teams throughout Haiti are still working to assess the damage. ""In the capital so far, we've been relatively lucky, all things considered."" The threat of ongoing rain remains real, as does the possibility of the spread of waterborne diseases, Desruisseaux said. Relief worker Roseann Dennery of Samaritan's Purse was near Cabaret, about 20 miles north of Port-au-Prince, on Friday morning, touring camps that hold some of the 1 million people left homeless by January's 7.0-magnitude earthquake, which killed some 250,000 people. ""It's almost eerie,"" she said. ""It's rainy, it's dark and there's really not a lot of movement."" The few people moving from tent to tent were wrapped in sheets and cloth to provide some protection against the constant rain, she said. The ground was soaked and some low-lying areas had minor flooding. Some people rode out the storm in open-air community centers with supposedly sturdy roofs, she said. But many just huddled in their tents, waiting for the wind and rain to pass. Most didn't have anywhere else to go. ""A lot of them do not have families or relatives,"" said Dennery. Many structures that would usually be used for storm shelters -- schools and hospitals -- are no longer standing. She said her agency, an international Christian relief organization, evacuated 30 staff members from Leogane out of fear of mudslides there. Michael Dockrey, the director in Haiti for the International Medical Corps, also expressed his deep concern Friday. ""Particularly,"" he told CNN, ""with mudslides that can cut off whole communities. We have pre-positioned medical supplies, tents, tarps and staff in areas that we know will be isolated."" Aid workers already were struggling to keep up with the cholera outbreak, which has killed nearly 450 people and hospitalized about 7,000. The bacterial disease causes diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to deadly dehydration within hours. ""It's obviously stretched us all real thin,"" Dockrey said. ""We could certainly use more help ... as can all the other responders."" The hurricane will likely only make matters worse. ""Even if Tomas only brushes Haiti, it may exacerbate the epidemic, facilitating the spread of the disease into and throughout metropolitan Port-au-Prince, where a third of the population remains homeless and in camps,"" the International Organization for Migration said. Tomas became a Category 1 hurricane as it approached Haiti early Friday, forecasters said. It was previously a Category 2 hurricane and then weakened to a tropical depression before reintensifying. Forecasters predict the storm could strengthen during the next 24 hours before weakening again Saturday night and Sunday. The biggest threats were mudslides and flash flooding, said CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. Port-au-Prince is bounded on three sides by hills, and rain runoff could cause flooding, Wolf said. The low-lying port city also borders the Caribbean Sea. Winds from the storm had slowed to 75 mph (120 kph), the Hurricane Center said Friday evening, adding that Tomas was moving northeast at 14 mph (22 kph). The eye of the storm was expected to pass near or over the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands Friday night or early Saturday. Rain associated with the storm started falling on Haiti on Thursday as aid agencies scrambled to move as many people as possible into storm shelters. As it did after the earthquake, the United States offered its assistance. The U.S Agency for International Development had pre-positioned supplies, but rushed more into the country before the airport closed ahead of the storm, said Mark Ward, acting director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance. Citing Haitian authorities, Ward said at a Friday briefing for reporters that about half the residents at temporary camps left those facilities overnight to stay with family or friends. He said the Haitian government has confirmed one fatality. In addition, the U.S. Navy redirected the USS Iwo Jima to Haiti from Suriname, where the ship's crew was conducting a four-month humanitarian mission. In addition to search-and-rescue-trained helicopter crews, the ship is carrying more than 200 medical personnel and 60 Navy construction engineers who can help with recovery efforts. The ship is also carrying a 500-member Marine task force and personnel from nongovernmental relief agencies. Negus, who participated in the Navy response to the earthquake, said he did not expect the fallout from Tomas to be anywhere near as severe. ""It's everyone's prayer here that our capabilities will not be required,"" Negus said. ""But everyone should be very confident that we are prepared if they are.""

705,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The first commercial spacecraft to return from a low-Earth orbit landed in the Pacific Ocean Wednesday about 500 miles off the coast of southern California. SpaceX launched the spacecraft, called the Dragon, atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 10:43 a.m. Wednesday. The spacecraft orbited Earth at more than 17,000 mph and then splashed down at 2 p.m. Eastern. The successful mission marked the first time a commercial firm recovered a spacecraft from a low orbit -- a feat performed by only six nations or government agencies: the United States, Russia, China, Japan, India and the European Space Agency. The landing was also the first flight under NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program to develop commercial supply services to the International Space Station. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said he deemed the mission a success. ""These new explorers are to spaceflight what Lindbergh was to commercial aviation,"" Bolden said. ""While rocket launches from the Cape are considered a common occurrence, the historic significance of today's achievement by SpaceX should not be lost. ""This is the first in a new generation of commercial launch systems that will help provide vital support to the International Space Station and may one day carry astronauts into orbit. This successful demonstration flight is an important milestone in meeting the objectives outlined by President Obama and Congress, and shows how government and industry can leverage expertise and resources to foster a new and vibrant space economy,"" Bolden said.","NASA official cites ""historic significance of today's achievement by SpaceX""

706,"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- Qantas is considering legal action against engine-maker Rolls-Royce after one of the manufacturer's engines sparked a fire on a flight last month, the airline said Thursday. The Federal Court of Australia granted the Australian carrier an injunction Thursday allowing it to pursue legal action against Rolls-Royce in Australia if a commercial settlement is not possible, Qantas said. Qantas said it has already started discussions with Rolls-Royce. A Sydney, Australia-bound Qantas Airbus A380 was forced to turn back to Singapore on Nov. 4 when an oil fire badly damaged one of the plane's four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines. The fire resulted in part of the engine casing falling off in flight. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau issued a safety recommendation Thursday about the Trent 900 engines, which are installed on some A380 superjumbos, the world's largest airliner. The ATSB said it had identified a potential manufacturing defect with the Trent 900 on some A380s that could have been a factor in last month's fire on the Qantas flight. ""The problem relates to the potential for misaligned oil pipe counter-boring, which could lead to fatigue cracking, oil leakage, and potential engine failure from an oil fire within the HP/IP bearing buffer space,"" the ATSB said in a statement. Rolls-Royce said checks conducted immediately after the Nov. 4 incident showed the problem was specific to the Trent 900 and that it was confined to a specific component in the turbine area of the engine. That in turn caused an oil fire, Rolls-Royce said. A Rolls-Royce spokesman said Thursday the ATSB recommendation was consistent with those findings. ""We have instituted a regime of inspection, maintenance, and removal which has assured safe operation,"" the spokesman said. ""This program has been agreed in collaboration with Airbus, our airline customers, and the regulators."" Qantas grounded its A380 fleet for several weeks while it inspected the problem. It said Thursday it is doing further one-off inspections of the engines for possible tubing defects. The ATSB plans to hold a media briefing Friday when it releases its preliminary report into the mishap.

707,"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's second-largest airport was closed for a second day Thursday because of unseasonal wintry weather that was also affecting the European continent. All flights into and out of London's Gatwick Airport were canceled until 6 a.m. (1 a.m. ET) Friday, the airport said. It asked passengers to check with their airlines before heading to the airport. Planes sat at the gates covered in snow and a spokesman said the snow was falling on the airport's lone runway faster than crews could clear it. ""We are doing everything we can to resume operations,""the airport said in a statement. ""Our teams are working around the clock to make the runway safe for aircraft to use and get our passengers flying again."" Thursday, airport officials handed out 1,000 blankets along with food and water to stranded passengers who had little to do but sit around and hope for the weather to improve. The United Kingdom has seen the heaviest and most widespread amount of snow since 1993 and the deepest November snow since 1965, the Met Office, Britain's weather forecaster, said. Forecasters issued severe weather warnings Thursday, predicting heavy snow for many parts of the country including Scotland, northeast England, parts of central England, and the entire south from Cornwall to London and the southeast. Edinburgh Airport in Scotland was closed because of heavy snow, the airport said. London's Heathrow Airport was open, but said some airlines were experiencing delays and cancellations because of snow disruptions at other airports. Eurostar, which operates trains between London and the continent, said it was operating a ""significantly reduced"" timetable on Thursday with a number of cancellations, along with delays of as much as 90 minutes. It said disruptions were expected through the weekend, and it advised passengers booked to travel through Sunday to postpone their journeys if not essential. The main reason for the snowfall is the cold polar air sweeping across the North Sea, said Mari Ramos of the CNN World Weather Center. The sea is still relatively warm, at 9-10 degrees Celsius (48-50 degrees Fahrenheit), so as the water evaporates and is hit by the cold polar air, it turns to snow. ""You normally have this change in the wind pattern later in the season, but it won't bring snow because the ocean will be colder,"" Ramos said. Snowfall has also been widespread across Europe, with unseasonably low temperatures -- easily 10 degrees below average for this time of year -- lasting much longer than normal, Ramos said. Snow was expected across France, from the northern part of the country into the southern parts, near Switzerland and Italy, Ramos said. As much as six centimeters (2.4 inches) were expected in some areas. Meteo France issued an orange weather warning -- it's second-highest -- across central France, and forecasters predicted icy conditions and heavy snowfall. A quarter of flights out of Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport and 10 percent of flights out of Orly were canceled Thursday, air traffic control said. Trains were delayed throughout France but were expected to run regularly Friday. The snow was stretching into northern Portugal and central and southern Spain, with an unusual snowfall in Grenada earlier in the week, she said. Temperatures were another big concern. ""The temperature will be in many cases 8-12 degrees below the average, and that's not factoring in the wind,"" Ramos said. The chilly weather began over the weekend and is scheduled to last for a week, she said. CNN's Alex Felton in London, England, and Saskya Vandoorne in Paris, France, contributed to this report.","NEW: Forecasters issue severe weather warnings .

708,"(CNN) -- After a rough night spent wrapped in tablecloths and dozing on floors, stranded showboat passengers walked to safety Sunday from their disabled vessel via a 30-foot plank, a spokeswoman for the company that owns the boat said. By noon Sunday, all 567 passengers and 76 crew members had been escorted off the Showboat Branson Belle, according to Lisa Rau, a spokeswoman for Herschend Family Entertainment. Marine experts onboard the ship Sunday afternoon were focusing on the boat's propulsion system, including its paddle wheel, as a possible reason the ship ran aground the previous day in a remote area of Missouri's Table Rock Lake, Rau said. The grounding left all those trapped and forced to spend the night on a boat without any sleeping accommodations. Earlier, the arduous task of reaching the boat's remote location involved bulldozing vegetation to create a pathway. Gusty winds and freezing temperatures made that and the disembarking process difficult, according to Rau. ""We are moving heaven and earth to get to them,"" Rau said earlier Sunday,. The boat left the dock in Branson, Missouri, at 4 p.m. Saturday and ran aground after the captain had problems with the thruster during the cruise, which was scheduled to last two and a half hours. The boat did have heat and electrical power, Rau said, and passengers were provided food and beverages. ""It's not the best case scenario, but we're doing everything we can to make sure everybody's as comfortable as possible,"" Rau said earlier. Jim Wellborn, a passenger stranded in the boat, said that they were in the middle of a comedy show when the captain interrupted and told the audience that the boat 's propellers had hit something under water. ""We were almost back to the dock, when we heard a couple of loud noises. The comedian said something funny and we all laughed,"" he said. The Showboat Branson Belle is a 750-seat paddle boat with no gambling or alcohol, she said. Its featured ""Showstoppers"" performance includes 30 songs, according to the cruise website. All those passengers stranded overnight will get annual passes to the Silver Dollar City theme park in Branson that, like the boat, is owned by Herschend Family Entertainment, along with a full refund for the cruise, said Rau.

709,"(CNN) -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers offered support Monday to state and local officials in western Washington battling fast-moving floodwaters and rising rivers. Six teams, including 39 flood fighters, were sent to the Olympic Peninsula and the Chehalis, Nooksack, Skagit, Snohomish and Puyallup river basins to monitor areas of concern and provide real-time river condition observations to the local and federal emergency operations centers, officials said. The Corps also supplied two pumps to the city of Orting at its request and 15,000 sandbags to Snohomish County. Monday morning, the National Weather Service was reporting major flooding on the Snoqualmie River at Carnation and moderate flooding on the Snohomish River at Snohomish. Flooding also was occurring or was predicted for areas along the Green, Nooksack, Skagit, Skokomish and Chehalis rivers, according to the weather service's Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service. The Stillaguamish River, which Sunday evening rose to a record level at Arlington, had receded below flood stage Monday morning and will continue to drop, the prediction service said. The rain that led to the flooding also triggered mudslides that shut down passenger trains north and south of Seattle over the weekend. About 300 people are staying in shelters after homes flooded in several cities north of Seattle, said Rob Harper an emergency management spokesman for Washington. He said they evacuated voluntarily. ""Swift-water teams were called out Sunday,"" Harper said. ""Rescue operations are still being mobilized to be available if needed."" Rivers in nine counties had crested at or above flood stage by Sunday morning, the state Emergency Operations Center reported. And a mudslide north of Vancouver, Washington, just across the state line from Portland, Oregon, shut down Amtrak's Cascades train route until Tuesday morning, Amtrak said. ""They have to make sure where the mudslide occurred or anywhere else along that track, that the slope is stable enough to where there will not be any chances of an additional mudslide occurring before they release passenger traffic back onto the track,"" said Washington Department of Transportation spokeswoman Vickie Sheehan. Mudslides occurred north of Seattle as well, shutting down train service that connected the city to Canada, Sheehan said. But shutting down the Portland-to-Seattle run has ""a much bigger impact that affects a lot more people,"" she said. Amtrak will provide bus service for all ticketed passengers throughout the weekend and until the rail line reopens, Amtrak spokeswoman Vernae Graham said. CNN's Antoinette Campbell, Jessica Jordan, Shelby Lin Erdman, Leslie Tripp and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sends six flood flight teams to Washington state .

710,"(CNN) -- A group of Chilean miners who spent 69 days trapped underground have traveled to Britain as the guests of football team Manchester United. A collapse at the San Esteban mine in Chile on August 5 left 33 men stranded, but they were rescued amid jubilant scenes as the world's media watched in October. Twenty-three of those miners are visiting England, having been invited to cities around the world after becoming international celebrities. They took part in a training session with United manager Alex Ferguson at the club's Carrington headquarters on Monday ahead of watching that night's Premier League visit by title rivals Arsenal. ""It's fantastic that they're coming,"" the 68-year-old told United's website. ""These are people who showed real substance and perseverance to make sure they survived. There are examples in life which you should always take note of. ""I mean, the life of a miner, having to work in the bowels of the earth and not being able to see anything. That's a great sacrifice to earn your living. I'm sure they'll enjoy themselves on their trip."" Former United star Bobby Charlton also met the club's South American guests. ""I can't believe these are the same people the whole world dropped everything for,"" Charlton said. ""You took it in your stride and everyone around the world is very proud of you."" Last month the miners were saluted with a standing ovation at the CNN Heroes event in Los Angeles, California. Heroes show opens with salute to Chilean miners . In October Manchester United invited them to visit, while Spanish football star David Villa sent two shirts from his club team Barcelona to the families of the men while they were still trapped to show his sympathy. Former Chile defender Elias Figueroa, who played in three World Cups and collected 47 caps for his country, accompanied the miners on their trip.","Manchester United have welcomed 23 of the rescued Chilean miners to the club .

711,"Washington (CNN) -- Leaders around the world Tuesday mourned the death of the diplomat who spearheaded the end of the Bosnian war on the 15th anniversary of the peace deal he helped design. Richard C. Holbrooke, 69, died Monday after doctors performed surgery to repair a tear in his aorta. He most recently served as the Obama administration's point man in the volatile Afghan-Pakistani war zone. ""You've got to stop this war in Afghanistan,"" he told a Pakistani surgeon at George Washington University Hospital as he was being sedated for surgery, according to a senior administration official. That was one of his final comments, the official said. Holbrooke was perhaps best known for his role as the chief architect of the Dayton Peace Accords -- signed December 14, 1995 -- which ended the deadly ethnic conflict that erupted during the breakup of Yugoslavia. ""I had the honor and privilege of working with Richard through many international crises over several decades, most particularly the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo,"" former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said. ""He could always be counted on for his imagination, dedication and forcefulness."" After President Barack Obama took office in 2008, Holbrooke took one of the toughest diplomatic assignments -- U.S. special  representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the region Obama regards as critical to the fight against terrorism. Holbrooke's assertive style worked in the Balkans, but it brought perils for diplomats in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where long stretches of chatting and tea-drinking are the norm. He was frank in his assessments about the region and officials in both countries regarded him as abrasive, including Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In April 2009, there were reports of a heated argument between Holbrooke and Karzai after charges of fraud surfaced in the Afghan presidential election. Karzai's office issued a brief statement Tuesday, describing Holbrooke as ""a veteran and seasoned diplomat who had served greatly to the government and the people of the United States."" ""Achieving peace and stabilization of a country with complex realities on the ground, as well as in the region, is not an overnight task, but there was no doubt that he was pursuing his mission not only objectively, professionally and patriotically as an American, but at the same time as a friend of Afghanistan,"" said Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan's former foreign minister. ""That was what we admired most."" In an interview with CNN, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari called Holbrooke an ""extremely hard-working man"" who can ""get things done which would otherwise take weeks to get through."" One of the world's most recognizable diplomats, Holbrooke's career spanned from the Vietnam War era to the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, coinciding with presidencies of the past five decades, from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. He also worked as a journalist and an investment banker. But as a diplomat, he was plain-speaking, accessible, and known for his tough-mindedness. Obama called Holbrooke ""a true giant of American foreign policy who has made America stronger, safer, and more respected."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the nation had lost ""one of its fiercest champions and most dedicated public servants."" ""He was the consummate diplomat, able to stare down dictators and stand up for America's interests and values even under the most difficult circumstances,"" Clinton's statement said. ""Few people have ever left a larger mark on the State Department or our country."" A statement appearing on numerous radical Islamist websites used Holbrooke's death to condemn the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. ""People cannot turn a blind eye to the presence of (U.S. and allied) troops and cannot be fooled by (Gen. David) Petraeus, Holbrooke and others who should know that their fate is a scandal, madness, fainting, or worse than that,"" the statement read. Shortly after taking office, Obama appointed Holbrooke to the special representative job and Holbrooke dove in headfirst to tackle the challenges. In an October interview with CNN, Holbrooke cautioned patience in the struggle against the militants and for democracy in the so-called AfPak region, a mission that he said was of the ""most vital importance to our national security interests."" ""We are determined to see it through,"" he said, and he made reference to the Vietnam War and the Dayton Accords in his insights. He noted that dealing with so many foes on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border made the process difficult. ""A peace deal requires agreements, and you don't make agreements with your friends, you make agreements with your enemies,"" he said. Holbrooke mentioned a range of militant groups, such as the Afghan Taliban, the Pakistani Taliban, the Haqqani Network, and Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and noted that ""an expert could add another 30."" ""There's no Ho Chi Minh. There's no Slobodan Milosevic. There's no Palestinian Authority. There is a widely dispersed group of -- of people that we roughly call the enemy. There's al Qaeda, with which there's no possibility of any discussion at all."" ""There is no clear single address that you go to,"" Holbrooke said. CNN's Jill Dougherty, Nic Robertson, Joe Sterling and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","President Obama calls Holbrooke a true giant of U.S. foreign policy .

712,"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- A design issue rather than poor maintenance is likely to blame for the mid-flight failure of a Qantas airliner's engine, the CEO of the Australian carrier said Friday. One of the four engines on the Qantas Airbus A380 shut down six minutes after takeoff Thursday from Singapore's Changi Airport, forcing it to return and make an emergency landing. The plane -- with 440 passengers and 26 crew members -- was headed to Sydney, Australia. But while above the western Indonesian island of Batam, part of the engine's covering, or cowling, tore off. ""This issue does not relate to maintenance; this is an engine issue,"" CEO Alan Joyce told reporters Friday. ""And the engines have been maintained by Rolls-Royce since they've been installed on the aircraft."" ""So we believe that this is probably most likely a material failure or some sort of design issue that we're tracking and trying to understand,"" he added. ""We don't believe this is related to maintenance in any way."" On Friday, Airbus announced that it had asked all operators of A380s with Rolls-Royce engines to inspect them as a precaution. Following the Qantas CEO's comments, a Rolls-Royce spokesman referred back to his company's earlier news statement, which said: . ""Since Qantas QF32 suffered an engine failure and returned safely to Singapore Changi Airport, we have been working closely with our customer and the authorities. In situations like these, Rolls-Royce has well established processes to collect and understand information relating to the event and to determine suitable actions."" After the incident, Qantas -- Australia's national airline -- grounded its Airbus A380 fleet. The airline said flights of the twin-deck planes -- the world's largest airliners -- will remain suspended until an investigation is complete. On Friday, Joyce said Qantas hopes to resume A380 flights within 48 hours, after completing engine safety checks. ""We believe over the next 24 to 48 hours, those checks will be complete on all of the A380s, and if we don't find any adverse findings out of the checks, the aircraft will resume operations,"" he said. Qantas has six A380s in its fleet of 191 planes. Airbus will at some point deliver 14 more, the airline said. Passengers on the detoured Qantas flight spent the night in Singapore, then flew to Australia on Friday. ""Passengers left on a special Qantas flight at 10:30 a.m. local back to Sydney,"" said airline representative Ashley Edwards Knapp. CNN's Zain Verjee and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","NEW: Airbus requests inspections on all 380s with Rolls-Royce engines .

713,"(CNN) -- A huge winter storm was affecting the West Coast on Sunday, poised to dump up to 10 feet of snow in some higher elevations, and causing flooding and potential mudslides in lower spots while impacting driving conditions and air travel, forecasters said. A winter storm warning remained in effect through Monday afternoon for California's Sierra Nevada mountains, from Yosemite to Kings Canyon, according to the National Weather Service. ""Storm totals of 5 to 10 feet above 7,000 feet are likely,"" the weather service said, and periods of heavy snow will continue through Monday. High winds are also forecast for the region. ""Travel into the high country of the southern Sierra Nevada may be difficult, if not impossible,"" according to forecasters. That  possibility exists for the northern Sierras as well. At 3:56 p.m. PST, the National Weather Service was predicting blizzard conditions with winds of up to 70 mph along the higher mountain passes. That could shut down traffic along Interstate 80, state Highway 50 and state Highway 88. The Weather Service was urging residents in the higher mountain areas to check their generators and buy extra food and supplies. ""It's going to be an all-day onslaught,"" said CNN Meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. Areas from Denver westward will see rain, he said. At lower elevations, heavy rain was causing flash flooding in a number of locations. Flood advisories and watches were posted almost the entire length of California, from Redding to San Diego. Los Angeles had received 2 to 3 inches of rain as of about 2:30 a.m. Sunday (5:30 a.m. ET), and ""more significant rain"" was on the way, forecasters said. Flooding in the San Joaquin valley, which includes Fresno and Sacramento, is a ""firm possibility,"" said Wolf. Footage from Sacramento showed drivers creeping through water on roadways. As of Sunday afternoon, the California Emergency Management Agency was reporting localized flooding across the state, prompting road closings in San Luis Obispo, Fresno, Tulare, Amador, Venture County, Kern County and Humboldt County. And with the heavy rain comes the threat of mudslides, especially in areas near Los Angeles affected by this year's wildfires, where there is no vegetation to hold the soil in place, Wolf said. The soil becomes saturated and gravity pulls it downward. ""Some minor debris and rock slides have already been reported early this morning,"" said a southern California flood advisory issued by the National Weather Service, ""and this threat will likely continue through this morning."" The threat could also be delayed, meaning it will not abate when the rains stop and could occur later, Wolf said. In Placer County a minor mudslide forced the closing of one of two lanes on Interstate 80 on Sunday. The storm -- actually a series of storms -- were triggered by ""deep persistent moisture"" originating from the subtropical Pacific and surging northeastward, said CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris. The phenomenon is often called the ""Pineapple Express,"" he said, because the moisture originates near the Hawaiian islands. The series will affect the region through Wednesday, with the strongest portions yet to come, Morris said Saturday. Rainfall amounts could reach 10 to 12 inches in some spots, and up to 18 inches in some isolated areas, he said. The storms could be the strongest to hit southern California since January 2005, he said, when up to 32 inches of rain came in a five-day period. On Saturday, there were more than 260 freeway crashes in Los Angeles County and unincorporated areas because of the rain, said California Highway Patrol Officer Ed Jacobs. That is compared to 48 last Saturday, when it was not raining, he said. Most of the crashes were ""minor fender benders,"" he said, but two people died in a crash in Santa Clarita. ""We think the driver was just going too fast in that case,"" he said. About 5,000 customers lost power in southern California, said Steve Conroy of Southern California Edison, but noted that is a small percentage of the company's 5.4 million customers. The biggest problem the company faced on Saturday was drivers traveling too fast and sliding into poles, causing some service interruptions, Conroy said. The company serves some of the mountain areas, and have crews in place there, he said. ""Overall, we're in good shape."" About 2,100 customers lost power early Sunday in the Highland Park area of Los Angeles, but power had been restored as of about 6:30 Sunday morning, said Maychelle Yee, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The outages were likely weather related, she said. Further north, high winds affected Seattle, downing trees and power lines, and knocking out power to about 100,000 people. Most of those had been restored as of Sunday. Footage from Spokane, Washington, showed drivers crashing as they slid down a snowy hill. Besides the potential for road closures, air travel could be affected in cities including San Francisco; Los Angeles; Seattle; Portland, Oregon; and Salt Lake City, Wolf said. Those delays could have a ripple effect elsewhere as a busy holiday travel week approaches.

714,"(CNN) -- When Ryan Arnold died after donating a piece of his liver to his brother, Chad, his friends and family mourned the loss of a hero who risked his life to save his brother. The death affected someone else, too -- someone who'd never met the Arnolds. Her name is Laura Fritz, and when she learned about Ryan's death in August in an online television news piece, she was ""devastated."" ""It hit really close to home,"" she told CNN. ""Because I knew that could have been me."" Four living liver donors have died in the United States since 1999, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, including Arnold and another patient who died earlier this year at the Lahey Clinic in Massachusetts. About 38% of liver donors have some kind of complication, according to the Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study, a project to disseminate information about living donor liver transplants. Some experts think some of these deaths and complications could have been prevented if there was a change the way hospitals exchanged information about complications with organ donations. ""My body was just shutting down"" Like Ryan Arnold, Laura was young and feeling great when she gave away part of her liver. Both had surgery at the University of Colorado Medical Center, one of the world's most respected transplant centers. In Laura's case, it was her mother, Jane Fritz, who had a debilitating liver disease and needed a transplant. Laura was 26 and her mother 59 when Laura had 60% of her liver surgically removed and given to her mother on September 30, 2009, less than a year before Ryan Arnold had the same surgery. At first, everything seemed fine. The surgery went well, and both were discharged from the hospital without complications. When Laura Fritz got home, everything changed. ""I realized I wasn't doing as well as I was supposed to be doing,"" she remembered. ""I wasn't eating anything. I wasn't keeping anything down, fluids or anything."" Jane Fritz took her daughter back to the hospital, where doctors admitted her and diagnosed a small bowel obstruction, which meant a section of her intestines was blocked. After three days of treatment in the hospital, she was able to eat and move her bowels, and she was discharged. Back at her home in Denver once more, Laura again started to feel ill, and three days later, she went back to the hospital. ""I was really pale. My lips were turning blue, and they couldn't find a blood pressure on me,"" she said. ""My body was just shutting down. ... No one at the hospital said I was going into organ failure, but my mom's a nurse, and she put two and two together."" Laura was rushed to surgery. Afterward, the doctors told her parents that Laura had a hole in her intestines, a medical emergency because if the hole isn't repaired in time, bacteria inside the intestines leak out and cause deadly infections. Laura fought for her life in the intensive care unit, and she spent the next 36 days in the hospital. ""There was a time when the doctors came to [my mother] and my father and said if this infection doesn't clear up within 24 hours, I'm not going to make it,"" she said. ""They went to the chapel and prayed."" Laura recovered completely, and she hopes doctors learn from her complication and from Ryan Arnold's death, which happened about 10 months apart. She added that she'd donate to her mother again in a heartbeat. ""It was a terrible, terrible situation, but what came out of it is my mom is alive, and I'm alive,"" she said. Surgeon: ""A devastating feeling"" Laura Fritz and Ryan Arnold had the same surgeon: Dr. Igal Kam, chief of the division of transplant surgery at the University of Colorado. In the past 22 years, the University of Colorado Hospital has performed 142 living liver surgeries, and Kam says he's been the surgeon for nearly all of them. Out of those 142 surgeries, there's been one death -- Ryan Arnold's -- and three major complications, including Laura's. He says Arnold's death and Fritz's complications are unrelated. Ryan Arnold was fine after surgery, and he was up and walking around just two days later. ""I checked on him personally at 8 o'clock on the third evening after his surgery, and everyone said he was doing great,"" Kam said. Then at midnight, he said, he received a call saying Arnold needed to be resuscitated. ""By that time, he was already dead,"" Kam said. ""He went to sleep and never woke up."" After Arnold's death, the University of Colorado issued a statement saying it was conducting a ""thorough review"" of his case. Kam said Laura Fritz's complication was ultimately caused by a pre-existing condition that was impossible to detect before the surgery. In her case, he said, one loop of her intestines ""kinked on itself"" and stuck to another loop of her intestines, and this adhesion caused swelling, which caused the hole in her intestines. Sometimes in abdominal surgery, a surgical instrument can poke a hole in the intestines, but that wasn't the case with Fritz, Kam said. He said the hole was in a section of the intestines far from her surgical site. Plus, he said, the pathologist who looked at the adhesion after it was removed reported that it was chronic and existed before the surgery. Kam says he gets a ""devastating feeling"" whenever there's a major complication or death of a living liver donor. ""I don't wish anybody, good friends or enemies, to have this type of feeling,"" he said. ""It's hard to live with."" He said Arnold's death hit him especially hard. ""I've lived with it every day, every minute of my life, since then,"" he said. After Arnold's death, the University of Colorado stopped doing liver transplants that involved living donors, but it expects to start up again in the next few weeks with new procedures for monitoring patients after the surgery, Kam said. Velvet Kelm, a spokeswoman for Ryan Arnold's widow, Shannon Arnold, declined comment when asked if they planned legal action. A call for a living donor death task force . When a donor has a complication, the hospital is expected to do its own investigation and report to the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, which oversees transplants for the federal government. ""This isn't acceptable,"" says Dr. Lloyd Ratner, director of renal and pancreatic transplant surgery at Columbia University. ""Never in a million years would we say to BP, 'Oh, you had an oil spill in the Gulf, why don't you do your own investigation and just tell us about it?' "" he said. ""That would be just crazy. It's not acceptable in other industries to do that, so why is it acceptable in ours?"" In an article published recently in the American Journal of Transplantation, Ratner said that a national living donor death task force should be established to systematically review organ donor deaths, and that these findings should be disseminated to all hospitals that perform live donor transplants. He says that right now, the lessons a hospital learns from the death of a donor are not disseminated to other hospitals, and that surgeons tend to learn from one another based on ""serendipity."" For example, in 2006, he and colleagues from another hospital were having lunch when they started discussing patients who'd died, or had severe complications, when a certain type of surgical clip was used. He said the clip would fall off the stump of a renal artery after the kidney had been removed from the donor. They  published their observations in a medical journal, and the major manufacturer of the clips alerted hospitals to stop using them for kidney donors. ""We found a suboptimal surgical technique, but it never would have happened if we hadn't just gotten interested in this and started to talk about it,"" he said. ""There should be a system for reporting these problems and learning from each other."" UNOS told CNN that its Operations and Safety Committee recently advocated a process similar to the one that Ratner suggested in his article, but it might not be adopted. ""While promising, we must weigh procedural and legal issues in determining whether and how to develop such a system,"" according to a statement from UNOS. Sharing data with the public . Transplant centers are required to inform UNOS when they've had a death or major complication, but UNOS doesn't share that information with the public, which means patients can't look up a hospital's transplant safety record. Donna Luebke, a registered nurse who donated a kidney to her sister and once served on the board of UNOS, says the organization ought to share that information with the public. Donors can make a fully informed decision only ""if all the data is out there, and we don't have that data,"" she said. In a statement to CNN, UNOS emphasized that serious complications and deaths are rare, and that ""through data collection and the input of many who have personal experience with living donation, we will do our utmost to minimize risks for future potential donors."" CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.","Ryan Arnold died after donating a piece of his liver to his brother, Chad .

715,"(CNN) -- A test of the United States' only long-range missile defense system failed Wednesday -- the second failure this year in two tries. The Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency said both the intermediate-range ballistic missile target and the long-range interceptor missile launched successfully, radar and sensors worked properly and the ""kill vehicle"" deployed. But the ""kill vehicle"" didn't hit the target. ""Program officials will conduct an extensive investigation to determine the cause of the failure to intercept the target,"" the agency said. ""The next flight test will be determined after identification of the cause of the failure."" The last test, in January, failed because of a problem with the sea-based X-band radar, the agency said. The X-band radar sits atop a modified floating oil platform and provides information about incoming missiles so military officials can launch a response. In both Wednesday's test and the test launched earlier this year, the target missile launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the interceptor launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The $100 billion missile shield program has had numerous problems. In December 2008, an interceptor launched from Vandenburg ""killed"" a target launched from Kodiak, Alaska. But the test wasn't able to determine a key aspect -- whether the interceptor could tell the difference between a decoy and a real missile -- because the decoy failed to launch. Riki Ellison, chairman and founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for the deployment of missile defense systems, said the failure ""is a tremendous setback,"" noting three major test failures in the past two years. Ellison said many of the country's interceptors are nearly identical to the one that failed Wednesday, and he questioned the military's confidence in the ground-based system deployed in Alaska and California.

716,"(CNN) -- A professional BMX rider remained hospitalized Saturday in Las Vegas, Nevada, after he suffered injuries in a horrific crash during a qualifying run, officials said. Lavin, 33, of Las Vegas, was rushed to University Medical Center after Thursday's accident at the three-day Dew Tour Championship. Video showed Lavin soaring high over a dirt ramp before crashing to the ground. Lavin was wearing a helmet, tour spokeswoman Nicole Mancuso told CNN. ""T.J. is an important member of the Dew Tour family -- the Tour, athletes and action sports industry are all keeping him in our thoughts and prayers,"" race officials said in a statement. Lavin's mother told CNN affiliate KTNV that Lavin broke his eye socket and wrist, and is in a medically-induced coma to reduce swelling on his brain. She said she's confident her son, a veteran of the pro dirt circuit, will pull through. The competitor remained in critical condition Saturday, hospital spokeswoman Danita Cohen said. Lavin, the host of MTV's ""Real World/Road Rules Challenge"" program, has won the gold at several X Games and has produced a music album, according to MTV. The Dew Tour was established in 2005 and features five events with a combined $2.5 million purse. Skateboarding and freestyle motocross are featured this weekend, along with the BMX competition.

717,"London (CNN) -- Lisa Suarez's voice breaks as she stands in the snow outside London's Heathrow airport, unable to get a flight home to Dallas, Texas. ""It's very hard,"" she says. ""All I want for Christmas is to hug my daughter."" She and her family are among hundreds of thousands of people stranded by ""freak weather conditions"" that dumped unexpected tons of snow on Europe this weekend, snarling flight schedules at the continent's busiest airports. Heathrow planned to cancel all arrivals Sunday, but later said it might allow three planes to land. A dozen long-haul flights are scheduled to take off Sunday night, spokesman Andrew Teacher said. He did not say which ones. Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris told travelers to expect two-hour delays and cancellation of a quarter of flights. One in five flights was being canceled at the French capital's second airport, Paris-Orly, with delays of an hour expected, Aeroports de Paris said on its website. Germany's Frankfurt airport said at least 500 of a planned 1,300 flights would be scrapped Sunday. And more snow is expected in Germany during the day, which will put further strain on flight schedules, spokesman Waltraud Riehemann said. More than 200,000 passengers were due to take off from Heathrow on Sunday, said Donna O'Brien, a spokeswoman for Heathrow airport operator BAA. Most won't be able to, she said. Workers were trying to remove 30 metric tons of snow from each of the airport's 200 aircraft parking stands, according to the airport's website. Meanwhile, ground travel in France was also snarled by heavy snowfall and cold temperatures. The U.K.'s Foreign and Commonwealth Office said Sunday that French authorities reported they are preventing all cargo trucks and buses from using roads in northern france and the greater Paris metropolitan area, and that car travel is ""unadvisable."" Air and rail services were also affected, the office said. The adverse weather in France even affected pop singer Lady Gaga, who said on her Facebook page that all 28 of her tour trucks had been detained by the government for more than 24 hours. The Lady Gaga concert set for Sunday night was rescheduled for Tuesday, according to the website of the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, where it was to be held. A Monday concert remains scheduled. Paris police said that since noon Saturday, more than 1,300 trucks had been barred from entering Paris, and no trucks were being allowed to circulate in the city. They could not confirm whether Lady Gaga's trucks were among them. In other travel news: . --Britain's Automobile Association helped more than 3,000 drivers by 10:30 Sunday morning, and was getting 800 calls for assistance every hour, it said. It expected 14,000 call-outs by the end of the day, nearly twice the average on a Sunday. Another organization, the RAC, said it was getting 1,500 calls an hour to help drivers, mostly in Scotland. --London's Gatwick airport says its runway is open and ""operations are gradually returning to normal."" --Heathrow will have no flights from Terminals 1 or 4, and only a small number from Terminals 3 and 5, it says. Terminal 2 is closed for renovation. --Heathrow urges passengers to check with airlines before flying. Contact numbers are listed on its website, www.heathrowairport.com . --British Airways tells passengers to check www.ba2go.com before coming to the airport. Customers who need to rebook in the U.S. should call 1-800-247-9297. Those in the UK should call 0800 727 800. BA warns of high call volume despite hiring extra call center staff and urges people to call only if necessary. --BMI cancels all flights to and from Heathrow and asks passengers not to come to the airport. --British train operator Network Rail says trains are running more or less normally, but advises passengers to check before traveling. Heathrow is Europe's busiest airport -- and one of the busiest in the world. Paris Charles de Gaulle is second, and Frankfurt sees the third-highest traffic on the continent. Forecasters say the United Kingdom will remain in the grip of bitter winter weather at least through Monday. Heathrow employees are working to try to make the airport fully operational by Monday. ""We've got a few thousand people that have, unfortunately, had to spend the night,"" BAA spokesman Teacher said Sunday. ""We've been making them as comfortable as possible with blankets, with food and water."" Teacher said ice is the main problem affecting flights. ""We are extremely sorry for the disruption that's been caused to people's journeys today, but the decision has been made simply to avoid any kind of potential risk,"" Teacher said. ""These are absolutely ... freak weather conditions,"" he added. ""We've not seen a storm like this in 20 years."" On Saturday, frigid temperatures and extreme conditions pummeled Europe. From Northern Ireland to Bulgaria, blizzard conditions left airports with heavy delays or shut them entirely. Snow, ice and fog have caused travel chaos ahead of a busy holiday travel week. And severe weather could continue on Monday as another series of weather systems move in, said Met Office special forecaster Tony Burgess. ""There is another risk of [heavy snow] across England and south Wales on Monday,"" Burgess said. The next wave of snowy weather is expected to bring up to 20 centimeters (8 inches) to some parts of the United Kingdom, with London expected to receive 5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) of snow. The weather system will move across France and Germany on Sunday. Below-normal temperatures are expected to continue in northern Europe into the beginning of next week.

718,"(CNN) -- A gunman faces six counts of attempted murder and other charges after he opened fire at an elementary school in southern California and injured two students who were outside during lunch, authorities said. The girls, ages 6 and 7, suffered minor arm injuries in the shooting Friday in Carlsbad, said Lt. Jay Eppel of the Carlsbad Police Department. Both were flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. Police indicated the students each were grazed in the arm by bullets. Construction workers at Kelly Elementary School detained a suspected identified as Brendan L. O'Rourke, 41, shortly after noon until officers arrived, Eppel said. Police do not suspect the man has a relationship with any students at the school. Worker Carlos Partida got into his truck and was able to knock the gunman down with the vehicle, police said in a statement. The man, dressed in black, was then tackled by other construction workers and witnesses. O'Rourke appeared to be trying to reload his handgun, police said, adding that the workers managed to remove the weapon. The suspect's vehicle was parked near the school. Officers found a handgun and propane tank inside, police said. O'Rourke also had taken a small gas can to the playground, police said. The suspect was taken to a hospital after he complained of back and neck pain, and faces six counts of attempted murder and numerous weapons violations, according to the statement. Police said the suspect provided three names, one of them a woman's name, when asked for identification. The superintendent for the school district thanked good Samaritans, police and school staff members for their actions Friday. Counselors will be at the school Monday to help students, staff and families ""handle the anxiety and fear that can result from a traumatic experience,"" John A. Roach said in a statement Saturday. Third-grade student Shaylyn Foley was on the playground with her friend and told CNN affiliate KGTV what she saw. ""I saw him and he was across the street. Phoebe said, 'Who is he?' Then I'm like, 'Phoebe, he might not be a good man.' Then he put his hand out and then I heard the shot, and then I'm like, 'Phoebe, come on, this isn't OK.'"" Shaylyn and her friend ran away as the gunman fired. Students were taken to a local park to be picked up by their parents. Pete Anderson, who operates a small research vineyard near the school, said he was tending vines when ""I heard something like a gunshot, followed by another."" Three more shots followed about 30 seconds later, he said. Children were yelling as they ran from a playground back toward the school, Anderson said. ""At this point, I knew this was not a drill,"" he told CNN. Anderson said he did not see the accused shooter until after he was taken into custody. The school is in a residential neighborhood in this city between Los Angeles and San Diego. ""This is extremely unusual,"" Anderson said.

719,"Chicago (CNN) -- Two Chicago firefighters were killed Wednesday and at least 17 were injured, when a wall and roof collapsed without warning in an abandoned building on the city's south side, the city's fire department said. None of the injuries was life-threatening, said Fire Commissioner Robert Hoff in an afternoon news conference. One firefighter was in stable condition, he said. Hoff identified those killed as Corey Ankum, who had been with the department less than two years, and 12-year veteran Edward Stringer. Both were inside the structure. Other firefighters were working the blaze from the roof. CNN affiliate WGN aired footage of a line of firefighters saluting one body as it arrived at the medical examiner's office later Wednesday. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said in a statement, ""The deaths of Firefighters Stringer and Ankum are both a sad reminder of how much gratitude we owe our first responders and a tragedy for all Chicagoans."" The deaths came on the 100th anniversary of the Chicago Stockyards fire, which killed 21 firefighters and the city fire marshal. The fire was reported shortly before 7 a.m. in the office area of a commercial building on East 75th Street, said Larry Langford, spokesman for the Chicago Fire Department. The routine fire call became a multiple-alarm blaze after part of the roof collapsed as firefighters were inside, he said. Four firefighters were trapped after the collapse occurred, and two of them died from their injuries, Langford said. The building was boarded up in the front but the back was open, leading firefighters to think that homeless people may have sought shelter there, Hoff said. The cause of the fire is under investigation, Hoff said. Investigators will look at whether ice or weather was a factor, as well as the age of the building and its heavy roof, the commissioner said. ""There are things that happen when buildings are aged, and that could have been one of the contributing factors in this case,"" Hoff said. The fire in the building's northeast corner had been brought under control, Hoff said, and firefighters were working on hot spots and ""looking for homeless or vagrant people"" when the collapse occurred. A wall of the building collapsed into an alley, Langford said, bringing part of the roof down with it. A search of the rubble found no one else, Langford said. Heavy equipment was being brought in to take the building apart. He said it was his understanding that both of the fallen firefighters had children. While the loss of a firefighter is always a tragedy, he said, ""it's been compounded"" by the deaths occurring so close to the holidays. Another firefighter died recently while battling a downtown blaze, he said. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","NEW: Mayor calls deaths a tragedy .

720,"(CNN) -- At least 27 fishermen were missing after a Vietnam-registered vessel sank in the South China Sea, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday, citing maritime rescue authorities. Strong gales caused the Phu Tan to capsize and sink and the fishermen fell overboard, the report said. The accident occurred about 110 nautical miles to the west of Sanya City in the southern island province of Hainan, a South China Sea Salvage Bureau spokesman said. A rescue vessel was headed to the site of the sinking, and a towboat was ordered to assist.","The vessel was registered in Vietnam .

721,"(CNN) -- At least 28 people were killed Wednesday after a boat carrying asylum seekers crashed into cliffs along the shore near the coast of Christmas Island, Australia's minister for immigration and citizenship said. Rescuers were able to pull 43 people from the ""dangerous"" waters and one person was able to swim to shore. ""It's a very difficult situation for everybody involved and of course, particularly, for those on Christmas Island: for the asylum seekers and for those involved in the rescue,"" Minister Chris Bowen said in an Australian radio interview. ""Those involved in the rescue -- both the naval officials, the customs officials and the locals -- did an outstanding job in saving so many people yesterday."" Bowen noted -- as Australia's border protection agency did earlier -- that weather in the area is treacherous. ""The rescue is being conducted in extremely difficult and dangerous conditions,"" the Australia's border protection agency said in a statement. '""We will continue the search until last light and review the situation and determine what further actions might need to be taken before first light tomorrow."" Bowen said 11 of the survivors were ""clearly children or say they're under 18. Of the deceased, we don't know yet."" Bowen also said it was unclear how many people were on the boat. ""People who have survived say that there were between 70 and 100, but we really don't know and we probably never will,"" he said. Most of the people on the boat were from Iran and Iraq, a rescue worker told Sydney radio station 2GB. ""Eyewitnesses told us that they saw babies being held in people's arms and then when the boat was hit by the wave and crashed up against the rocks, they could no longer see those young babies,"" said Jessica Campanaro, a reporter with the Australian radio station. ""There is an ongoing situation which involves a rescue of people off Christmas Island,"" a statement from Australian Customs and Border Protection said. ""Our paramount priority is the safety of all involved."" The group will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo security, identity and health checks and their reasons for travel will be established, according to the Customs and Border Protection statement. The tragedy has spurred discussions of Australia's immigration policies, but Minister Bowen said there would time enough for those discussions later. ""It's appropriate that there be a political discussion about this, and people will have strong views,"" he said. ""My focus, together with [Minister for Home Affairs] Brendan O'Connor and the prime minister [Julia Gillard] is on the situation we have at Christmas Island. There'll be inquiries and investigations, but I think what we can best do today is lend our support to the valiant rescue efforts of our naval and customs personnel, and also the locals on Christmas Island who responded magnificently."" Christmas Island is an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, nearer to the Philippines than to Australia. The island is about 1,600 miles northwest of the western Australian city of Perth and 220 miles south of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.

722,"Haifa, Israel (CNN) -- Israeli police said Friday that they suspect arson in the wildfire that has killed at least 41 people and injured 17 in northern Israel over the past two days. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld cited ""suspicious objects"" found Thursday. He did not elaborate. Officials called the wildfire, which had scorched more than 7,400 acres and continued to burn, the worst in the nation's history. A police investigative team and a fire expert team have been working to determine the cause of the fire, which started from a single location, said Dudi Cohen, Israeli police commissioner. Forty of the fatalities were cadets in Israel's prison service who were en route Thursday to help evacuate 500 inmates from Damon prison near Haifa when their bus became engulfed in the fast-moving blaze, the Jerusalem Post reported. ""The bus had no chance; they tried to escape but were burned alive,"" a firefighter spokesman told the newspaper. ""It was a horrific scene."" Eight funerals were held Friday and several bodies were still being identified, the Jerusalem Post reported. Israeli firefighter spokesman Yoram Levy said shifting 29 kph (18 mph) winds made the inferno harder to control as flames neared a neighborhood in Haifa, a major tourist destination on the northern coast. Built on the slopes of Mount Carmel about 50 miles north of Tel Aviv, Haifa's metropolitan area is also host to historical sites that date to Biblical times. More than 15,000 people have been evacuated from villages and towns in the area, emergency officials said. The fire has also threatened a sensitive ecological area near the Hai Bar nature reserve. Known as Mount Carmel's ""Little Switzerland,"" the reserve is home to a wildlife preservation project that seeks to bring back native species mentioned in the Old Testament. The fire, which began Thursday morning on Mount Carmel and spread through nearby areas, has triggered an outcry in Israel. Though the nation is known for its military might, it has failed to handle the calamity, according to critics. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Friday during a Security Cabinet briefing that Israel could not cope with the wildfire alone and thanked the more than 13 nations sending emergency crews and equipment to help douse the blaze. During a visit to victims in a hospital in Haifa, most of which was blanketed in smoke, Netanyahu said Russian planes were the latest addition to the international force aiding Israel. Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency reported that an II-76 plane capable of holding 42 tons of water, an amphibious BE-200 and an Mi-26 transport helicopter also used for fighting fires were scheduled to fly to Israel. ""On the way here, we flew over Carmel, where we heard and saw the Greek aircraft fighting the fire,"" Netanyahu said. ""I very much appreciate the mobilization of many countries."" Netanyahu talked Friday with U.S. President Barack Obama, who said in a statement that officials from the two nations have been ""in near-constant contact since the fires began."" Chemicals to suppress the flames -- including 45 metric tons of fire retardant and 12,000 liters of foam -- will arrive this weekend through the U.S. Agency for International Development, that agency said, with teams of U.S.-based firefighting specialists also on their way. Additionally, a U.S. military official said that Israel has asked for satellite imagery from the U.S. military, as well as planes to carry water and flame retardants. Israeli fire crews were also aided by Cyprus, England and Turkey, among others. Relations between Turkey and Israel have been tense since last spring, when Israeli commandos boarded a Turkish ship carrying humanitarian aid for Gaza, killing nine people. ""This is a very blessed step that the prime minister of Turkey has decided to take,"" Netanyahu told reporters about Turkey's help. ""I appreciate this much in a time of a humanitarian and ecological crisis. We will find ways to show our appreciation.""

723,"Paipote, Chile (CNN) -- In short order, freed miner Victor Antonio Segovia dispatches with some of the myths swirling around the 33 men rescued from the depths of the earth this week: He has no plans to write a book about what he endured in the San Jose mine, he isn't going to sue anyone for the collapse, and he intends to go back to working in the area's mines. ""Just not that one,"" Segovia says. All day Friday in the hardscrabble mining town of Paipote, Segovia's family and neighbors ready the Segovia family home for his arrival from the nearby hospital. All 33 men underwent a barrage of medical testing to see how their record days of imprisonment underground had affected them mentally and physically. All but two miners were released from the hospital Friday, and all the men are expected to make a full recovery. The Segovia family was particularly hard hit by the collapse. Two of the other trapped miners, Esteban and Pablo Rojas, are Segovia's cousins. ""Welcome home Victor Segovia,"" one neighbor said as she carried a handwritten sign greeting the miner into his home. ""If God has given you a new life and chance, grab on to it with everything you have."" The family has received gifts. While Victor's brother Pedro Segovia waits under the scorching sun of Chile's Atacama desert, he nervously toys with a brand new Sony media player. An anonymous gift left for the now famous miner. Pedro Segovia said his brother is tough and untouched by how close he came to dying in the dark recesses of the earth. ""We missed him a lot,"" Pedro Segovia said. But for him its just like another shift. As if he worked for eight hours and came home. If Segovia  has troubling memories of his long, forced stay in the mine, so far he hasn't shared them with his brother. ""He'll tell me at some point,"" Pedro Segovia said. ""What happened, what he lived through."" Inside the Segovia house are hints of how he passed the long weeks of eternal darkness. Two Chilean flags decorate a wall in a courtyard behind the Segovia's home. In carefully etched blue ink Victor drew a miner with a drill over a 33 on the white section of the flag. Below, each miner wrote his name and put his signatures in ordered columns. ""For you with all my heart,"" Segovia wrote his mother Blanca. The flags were a gift for her 50th wedding anniversary and were delivered by way of the ""paloma"" tube system that sent food and letters to the men. ""He likes to play the guitar, accordion and organ,"" Blanca Segovia said with pride about her son, who learned to play the instruments without any formal training. ""We are going to have a nice party for him."" But for the guest of honor just getting to the party will be almost as difficult as the previous legs of his journey. As the afternoon wears on, more and more media trickle into the neighborhood. Tripods and cameras are posted like sentries in front of the Segovia home. It has all the makings of an ugly media scene. So photographers agree and shake hands that all will stay in a fixed line so everyone can get an unobstructed shot of Segovia's homecoming. But hours later as Segovia steps from a van, a still photographer lurches forward and the plan is scrapped. Pushing against the wave of cameramen, Chilean police nearly have to carry the miner into his family's home. One of the photographers gets into a showing match with an officer after the melee. As the party gets under way, though, clapping and joyous chants of ""Chi Chi Chi, Le Le Le, los mineros de Chile,"" can be heard from outside the house. Then journalists still hanging around the house receive an invitation to come in and speak with the miner. Segovia appeared understandably worn from his ordeal and the crush of media attention. As reporters ask him questions, he looks down. His voice is soft and his answers are clipped. ""That was quite something,"" he said simply of the August 5 mine collapse. ""That was something very ugly."" He said he has been to Camp Hope, where family members waited for the miners' rescue. ""I don't need to go back,"" he said. Segovia said he missed his family terribly while in the mine. And, he said, he has become someone who ""thinks more about God."" ""We were a team,"" he said of the 33 men. ""But all the same there were problems. So much time together, like any family, the problems start but were ones we worked out."" Other miners have told CNN that the 33 men swore an oath never to discuss the details of what took place as the men struggled to survive in the mine. Before he goes back to the party, Segovia makes it clear he is not completely free of the mine. ""Down there you were always tired and didn't have any nightmares,"" he said. ""Here you have nightmares until you realize you are out.""","Victor Segovia, two of his cousins were trapped in the San Jose mine .

724,"(CNN) -- Stargazers who were willing to give up a little sleep got to catch the last lunar eclipse of 2010 early Tuesday. The total lunar eclipse lasted about three and a half hours, starting as a partial eclipse about 1:33 a.m. ET and finishing at 5:01 a.m. ET, according to NASA. As a coincidence, the eclipse fell on the same date as the 2010 winter solstice. The last lunar eclipse to happen on the day of the winter solstice was in 1638. ""For eclipse watchers, this means that the moon will appear very high in the night sky, as the solstice marks the time when Earth's axial tilt is farthest away from the sun,"" NASA said. In areas with clear skies, only watchers across North America, Greenland and Iceland were able to see the eclipse. Those in western Europe could see the beginning stages before the moon set, and stargazers in western Asia saw the later stages after moonrise, according to NASA. Share your lunar eclipse images, videos . The Twitter universe was aglow as the eclipse reached its peak. ""Moon fully covered, appears red - very cool,"" said Adam Goodman in Toronto, Ontario. The weather didn't cooperate for everyone though. ""Thank you cloudy sky for ruining the eclipse for me, apparently I woke up 3 for no reason,"" Seth Pelletier in Utah tweeted. The most recent lunar eclipse occurred June 26. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth lines up between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's rays and casting its shadow on the moon, according to NASA. As the moon moves into the Earth's shadow, it appears to change color, turning from gray to orange or deep red. The new color stems from indirect sunlight that passes through Earth's atmosphere and casts a glow on the moon, NASA said. ""Our atmosphere filters out most of the blue colored light, leaving the red and orange hues,"" the agency said. Lunar eclipses differ from their solar counterparts, as no special equipment is needed for viewing. NASA will stream a live video feed of the eclipse from a camera mounted at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Tuesday was the last chance for those in the continental United States to see a total lunar ecllipse until April 15, 2014, according to NASA. CNN's Emmanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","The eclipse was visible to North America, Greenland and Iceland .
The United States won't see another total lunar eclipse until 2014 .
The last lunar eclipse to happen on the day of the winter solstice was in 1638.",122 42287 25 37 1976 2 273 39 1 231 1965 178 2 2037 0 55 13458 18159 5 518 279 354 0 800 13458 18159 3729 44 95 3 1 396 283 1077 16 1 7493 18159 44 162 1521 1 171 4431 3 3612 12 280 2863 1 171 4431 120 2 4617 16 1 9000 0 18159 870 8 0 179 1117 16 0 518 1712 31591 0 55 13458 18159 2 821 8 0 108 5 0 1712 31591 14 4 89952 6 18159 12441 24 547 11 0 4356 42 876 107 220 4 0 189 1802 16 0 31591 2461 0 53 36 1746 7 96972 15592 10 30673 170 17 0 1514 4617 21 4 815 9 359 5797 80 12441 261 432 636 19634 3 9766 37 260 2 127 0 18159 118 4 1240 886 72 127 0 1267 3067 65 0 4356 184 3 42287 4 1240 2775 318 0 151 3067 31 69389 120 2 4617 877 208 13458 18159 1050 1948 0 796 6622 14 77731 16 0 18159 1016 86 3442 4356 1268 1334 875 659 107 2394 21 2547 12443 4 6631 11141 0 1492 211 47 7407 6 531 315 1730 78 14721 1802 6 13328 0 18159 6 135 1156 46 4219 39 308 6 61 786 10834 50158 4 4966 1779 0 96 346 13458 18159 1319 535 828 1 13458 18159 5845 36 0 1746 1611 39 136 0 1514 3 0 4356 5708 0 1514 7 10893 3 7683 86 3252 8 0 4356 120 2 4617 16 0 4356 2533 54 0 1746 7 3252 13 875 2 394 4390 1585 17 5480 2 3149 50 1245 659 0 68 4390 10537 17 15730 8818 11 4015 112 1746 7 2968 3 13548 1 9316 8 0 4356 4617 21 110 2968 13201 40 96 5 0 1194 13036 751 605 0 659 3 3149 19688 0 744 21 13458 38988 11598 17 34 5418 5530 16 61 629 1871 10 613 6 5094 4617 42 4958 1 369 139 2774 5 0 18159 17 1 1137 5421 12 0 7923 1109 1210 623 4 26654 4899 354 14 0 55 600 6 118 4 0 8979 259 323 2 127 1 800 13458 517002 206 577 292 688 120 2 4617 122 7 517754 45058 652 2 24 246,3ff0b5e06292e611626c160312aef0d451fc5515,0.0
725,"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli authorities are investigating whether the attack that left an American woman dead and her friend injured was ""nationalistic,"" a police spokesman said Monday, using a term for crimes in which a victim is targeted based on an Arab or Israeli background. American Kristine Luken died in the attack. Her body was found Sunday after Kay Susan Wilson, Luken's friend and co-worker at a Christian ministry, stumbled into a picnic area with her hands bound, bleeding from multiple stab wounds and asking for help. Wilson told authorities the two were hiking in a forest near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem, when two men attacked them, tied them to a tree and stabbed them, according to police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. Wilson told reporters from her hospital bed Sunday that one of the men was armed with a long serrated knife and that she believes they were Arab. ""It was clear that they came to kill,"" the Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted Wilson as saying. ""Who carries around a knife like that?"" Wilson said she was wearing a Star of David on a necklace when she was attacked, according to the newspaper. ""He took it off like a gentleman and then turned me around and stabbed in the place where the Star of David had been,"" Haaretz quoted her as saying. Rosenfeld confirmed Monday that investigators' primary focus is that the attacks may have involved nationalistic intent, but he said investigators have not yet completely ruled out other possibilities. Luken and Wilson both worked for CMJ UK, a Christian ministry based in England. Wilson, a British citizen living in Israel, was a senior tour guide for the group, according to a statement posted to the group's website by its CEO, Robin Aldridge. Luken was an administrator for the group and had recently taken over responsibility for managing the group's tour operations in Israel, Aldridge said. ""She had a beautiful and gentle spirit as well as a strong and vibrant faith,"" Aldridge said of Luken. ""She loved Israel and had visited on several occasions both as a tourist and as a member of CMJ."" ""It is a tragedy that such a lively, caring and faith-filled person should have been struck down in such a way,"" he said. The Foreign Office in London said it was ""aware of the hospitalization of a British national"" and was ready to provide assistance if needed. Luken had worked for CMJ UK for one year, having previously been a government employee, according to Aldridge. ""She had to cope with a move to a new country as well as a new job but quickly made the adjustment and became a key member of our team,"" Aldridge said. He said the group's work sharing the Christian faith with the Jewish people in Israel would continue despite the attack.","NEW: Police confirm they are focusing on whether the attack was ""nationalistic""

726,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Southern California faces another water-logged day Wednesday with renewed threats of flash flooding, especially in San Diego county. The National Weather Service is forecasting rainfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour, which could prompt flooding in the San Bernardino, Santa Ana and Palomar Mountains, and along the Orange County coastal plains. On Tuesday, storm-weary Californians slogged through another day of record-breaking snow, rain and flooding from a series of storms that prompted an emergency declaration from the state's governor. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's proclamation covers Kern, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo and Tulare counties in southern California. The declaration warns that the forecast calls for ""extraordinary and continuing rainfall"" that is likely to cause more flooding and landslides in the region and authorizes state assistance to local authorities. The five-day rain total has topped 10 inches in many areas, with much heavier amounts in some locales.  More than 21 inches has fallen on Twin Peaks in San Bernardino county, with Twin Creek receiving nearly 20 inches. In Orange County, authorities were on the scene after a mudslide affecting homes in the Silverado Canyon area, the county's Fire Authority said on Twitter. Rescues were needed, and evacuations were underway, according to the Fire Authority. In Los Angeles County, meanwhile, authorities ordered the evacuation of more than 230 homes in two neighborhoods out of fear of debris flows. Of the 232 homes ordered evacuated in the La Canada Flintridge and La Crescenta areas, however, only one family evacuated, said Nicole Nishida, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The area is a concern because it is below an area burned in the 2009 Station fire. Fires burn vegetation holding the soil in place, leaving the soil more likely to dislodge after heavy rains. One resident wary of the potential for mudslides was  Donna McLaughlin of La Canada Flintridge who lost her home last year when a 10-foot wall of mud came barreling down a hillside. She just moved back in October. ""Here we go again,"" she told CNN affiliate KABC. But this time, the city has bolted down protective concrete barriers and attached them to each other in the area in an effort to guard against mudslides. McLaughlin said the barriers were not bolted down or attached last year. ""Had they done that, our house would have at least been saved,"" she told KABC. Streets in downtown Laguna Beach were closed Wednesday because of extensive flooding, KABC reported. In southwestern Utah, a dam that authorities had feared was in imminent danger of giving way to floodwaters was found to be in stronger condition than previously believed, said Marc Mortensen, a spokesman for Washington County. The roughly 800 residents of the towns of Virgin and Rockville were allowed to return to their homes Tuesday night, Mortensen said. Engineers will monitor the dam, located on the Virgin River, and conduct more tests Wednesday, when high water flows are expected again, he said. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said he was prepared to declare a state of emergency in the south, where floodwaters also washed out at least one bridge. But as of Tuesday afternoon, Utah officials said the required benchmarks for an emergency declaration had not been reached, and Herbert hadn't received a request from local authorities to issue one. ""We are closely monitoring the activity in southern Utah, and praying for the safety of all of the area's residents,"" Herbert said in a statement from his office. Flash flood warnings were also in effect for western Arizona. In Southern California, where the car is king, a record number of motorists called their local auto club to report dead batteries, a need for emergency tows and crashed vehicles, said spokesman Jeffrey Spring of the Automobile Club of Southern California. More than 25,000 distraught motorists made calls for help on Monday, the largest number ever in a 24-hour period for the AAA's largest U.S. affiliate, Spring said. ""We're in Southern California, and we don't have a lot of experience driving in the rain, and some people drive through high puddles not realizing what kind of effect it can have on a car,"" Spring said. ""If the engine gets splashed and gets wet, it can stop the car right there."" Spring said AAA was ""able to serve the majority of members in 30 minutes,"" although he added, ""I'm sure there were a number of people who had to wait longer than that."" Monday's call volume surpassed the prior record of about 22,000 on October 9, 2008, when a heat wave and the scorching Santa Ana winds disabled many automobiles, Spring said. Monday's weather -- torrential rains -- had opposite conditions, he said. ""Batteries are fickle things if they're not at full strength,"" Spring said. ""Hot weather can affect them and weather like this."" In the southern Sierra Nevada, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks were effectively shut down Monday and Tuesday because flooding, mudslides and rockslides closed the two roads into the parks, said Brandy Frederich, assistant general manager of Wuksachi Lodge in Sequoia National Park. In fact, the 102-room lodge was vacant Tuesday after the last couple of guests departed Monday, Frederich said. ""Well, we're all up here,"" Frederich said of the hotel staff. ""We would be open if the road is open. It's gorgeous right now. Up here, it finally turned to snow."" But the rain at lower elevations washed out the two roads, she said. Deborah Craigo, 39, who lives in the Mojave Desert community of Hesperia, California, said monsoon conditions have inundated the arid landscape. Fire stations are even offering sandbags to residents who want to shore up defenses to their homes, said Craigo, who is also a CNN iReporter. ""It's been raining from two days ago and it just has not stopped. They closed a lot of the roads down,"" said Craigo, a mother and college student. ""It's pretty bad now. We have a riverbed in back of our house, and two days ago it was completely bone dry. And then within two days the riverbed is completely full."" In Orange County, California, four hikers whose truck was stranded by floodwater between two canyon roads were airlifted out Tuesday morning and were reported to be doing well, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. The four had been stranded overnight. Five other people were rescued in the same area Monday evening, the station said. A bulldozer was used to help get them to safety, it said. Elsewhere, 40 horses were rescued from Riverside County as water rose to heights of about 4 feet, affiliate KCAL reported. The storm is actually a series of storms originating in the Pacific, known as the ""Pineapple Express"" because of their origin near the Hawaiian Islands. They have brought heavy snow to the higher elevations, with torrential rainfall in lower spots, and high winds. Total rainfall has approached 10 inches in some areas. Numerous roads were closed because of mudslides or flooding. And as much as 13 feet of snow had fallen in the Sierra Nevada as of Tuesday, according to CNN Meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""We get a lot of snow here, but not usually this much in a 24-hour period,"" said CNN iReporter Sarah Butner, who is visiting family in Mammoth Lakes, California. The area has received about 9 feet of snow, she said Monday. ""The decks have a good 5 feet of snow on them,"" she said. One area of the neighborhood was also flooded, she said. In Arvin, California, near Lamont, Caliente Creek  washed away land near one home. Hugo Figueroa, who lives there, said he and his family were told to evacuate, CNN affiliate KBAK reported. Flooding washed out several roads near Lamont and Arvin, the station reported. High winds also whipped much of the state, particularly at high elevations. Peak wind gusts reached 152 mph in Alpine Meadows summit in northern California, the weather service reported. Mudslides forced officials to close a portion of State Route 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, in Ventura County from just north of the Los Angeles County line to Oxnard, according to the California Department of Transportation. The Pacific Coast Highway was also closed north of Santa Barbara due to flooding. A mudslide also closed a portion of State Route 41 in San Luis Obispo County. A stretch of State Route 34 in the Oxnard area was closed because of flooding. The danger of mudslides will probably intensify, CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said. ""A serious situation will develop now with the mudslide danger that will continue over the next several days,"" Cabrera said Monday. Another danger: Falling trees. Erik Budzinski of Orange told KABC he is heartsick after his vintage 1970 Ford F-150 truck was crushed by a large tree Monday night. ""It was my baby,"" he said. Budzinski said he was inside his home and heard the wood cracking and popping as the tree fell. ""I just knew it,"" he said. Still, many southern Californians were not deterred from holiday shopping by the rain, although the rain-slicked roads had led to thousands of accidents. ""It's a little scary to be driving with this much rain, but I'm going to deal with it,"" Adriena Young told KABC. ""It's better than a drought."" CNN's Jeremy Ryan, Sara Pratley, Nick Valencia, Michael Martinez, Ed Payne, Sara Weisfeldt and Daphne Sashin contributed to this report.","NEW: Reported mudslide affects homes in Orange County .

727,"(CNN) -- A 35-year-old Florida blasting inspector is presumed dead after the ground at a mine collapsed Thursday, sending him plummeting into a lime rock pit, police said. Kenneth James Stephens Jr. was working as a supervising contractor at Austin Powder Company as it detonated ammonia nitrate at the Mid Coast Aggregates mine in Webster, Florida, Sumter County Sheriff's Office Lt. Bobby Caruthers said by e-mail. After the controlled explosion, the earth collapsed beneath Stephens when he was about 30 feet from the blast site. He fell into a water-filled pit about 100 yards across, Caruthers said. Alerted shortly after noon, police arrived and initially saw no sign of the victim at the surface, nor did a police helicopter surveying the area from above. A crane lowered a pontoon, containing a dive team, into the pit to look for Stephens -- though, as of 6:30 p.m., his body had not been located. Recovery personnel have begun the next step in their effort, building a berm, likely out of limestone, to seal off the area where Stephens fell from the rest of the pit. When that's complete, they will pump out the water in hopes of finding the victim's body. Representatives from the Occupational and Safety Health Administration and the Mining Safety and Health Administration are on site, Caruthers said. He added that Austin Powder claims it has never had an accident like this since being founded in 1833, and that the sheriff's office has never responded to such an incident at this mine. Stephens, a resident of Beverly Hills, Florida, had participated in more than 1,000 controlled blasts in his 11 years at the Austin Powder Company, said Caruthers.","NEW: Police haven't found a 35-year-old Florida man who fell into a lime pit .

728,"Paris (CNN) -- Part of Paris Charles de Gaulle airport was evacuated Friday due to the accumulation of snow on the roof, and hundreds of flights were canceled because of a shortage of de-icing fluid, authorities said. Nearly 2,000 passengers were moved from Terminal 2E to other parts of the airport, authorities said, calling the measure ""preventative."" Part of the roof of that terminal collapsed in 2004, shortly after the state-of-the-art building was inaugurated. Four people were killed, media reports at the time said. About a foot of snow had fallen on the roof Friday by the time authorities decided to close the terminal, French media reports said. Authorities were working to clear it and reopen the terminal. French authorities earlier Friday asked airlines to cancel half their morning flights to and from the airport because de-icing fluid is running low, they said. That led to the cancellation of 400 flights Friday morning -- 200 arrivals and 200 departures. Then, early in the afternoon, they asked airlines to scrap a third of their flights for the rest of the day. Charles de Gaulle is the second busiest airport in Europe, after Heathrow in London. Paris' second airport, Orly, has not had to cancel flights because they are not running out of glycol, which is using for de-icing, authorities said. Airports in Europe are still struggling to get passengers to their destinations after they were snarled by unexpected snow over the weekend. Dublin airport was experiencing delays Friday because of de-icing and because airplanes are in the wrong places after the week's disruptions, it said in a statement.","Charles de Gaulle cancels a third of afternoon and evening flights .

729,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Federal officials are investigating whether this week's Pacific storms caused a pilot to crash his small plane into a mountain in a southern California state park, authorities said Friday. It is the second death that might be related to the storms. Christopher Julius Petrikas, 65, a former commercial airline pilot from Riverside, California, slammed his twin-engine Aero Commander plane into a 3,300-foot mountain summit in Lake Perris State Recreation Area on Monday, authorities said. That park is just 11 miles from the city where Petrikas lived. He was the small plane's sole occupant. On Friday, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board will examine if the weather was a factor in the fatal crash. ""Yes, weather will be among the factors NTSB and FAA examine,"" Gregor said in an e-mail response to CNN. The state park's superintendent, John Rowe, said visibility on the mountain was poor around the time of the crash. ""The weather was not favorable at that time of the morning,"" Rowe told CNN on Friday. ""Visibility was between 100 yards and sometimes, at the top of the mountain, it would be 10 to 15 yards when my partners and I were searching up there. We couldn't even see the sheriff's helicopter."" The other life that might have been taken by the storms was that of Angela Marie Wright, 39, of Menifee, California, who also died in Riverside County when her car was swept off a road and into Canyon Lake on Wednesday, according to the coroner's office. ""Weather might have been a factor, but we can't determine that until we complete the investigation,"" Riverside County Sheriff's Deputy Melissa Nieburger said Friday. ""We're investigating that as a traffic collision."" Overall on Friday, rain-soaked residents of California were enjoying a reprieve from the storms that inundated the state for most of the previous week. Another round of wet weather was expected to hit the West Coast over the holiday weekend. During Friday's break in the storm fronts, authorities were able to provide a detailed account of the dramatic search for the downed pilot. Rains so deluged the chaparral, grasslands, and hiking and equestrian trails on the mountain that Rowe's four-wheel drive vehicle became stranded and a park ranger's all-terrain vehicle toppled over, Rowe said. So his crews searched on foot in the rain for about 1.5 miles until they discovered the wreck and dead pilot, he said. ""That's how messy it was. The trails were running like small rivers so it made recovery efforts very, very difficult,"" Rowe said. The plane was found near a World War II crash site where a training plane from nearby March Air Reserve Base also hit the mountain and killed its crew, Rowe said. Petrikas, the small plane's pilot, began his 75-mile flight from Palm Springs to Chino around 9 a.m. Monday, but when he didn't land on time, authorities launched a search for him, Rowe said. The pilot was found after the Riverside County sheriff's office pinged his cell phone and investigators were able to track down his location, Rowe said. The eight-hour recovery mission left some search members with near hypothermia because of prolonged exposure to rain that fell at a rate of a half-inch or an inch an hour, Rowe said. Sixteen low-security state inmates, who are often used for brush clearing in wildfires, were deployed in the search, and they had to carry Petrikas' body for three miles from the soaked mountaintop, Rowe said. Rangers' stranded vehicles were left abandoned for four days because the heavy rain and mud made it impossible for them to be moved, Rowe said. The wrecked plane, which remains on the park summit, could be retrieved by next week, he said. Friday marked Southern California's second day of sunshine after five days of storms. At Malibu's renowned Surfrider Beach, surfers dressed as Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus and Frosty the Snowman were riding mild waves during a lull in the weather Thursday, said Malibu resident Julie Ellerton, who videotaped the spectacle for a CNN iReport. But many residents of the region and three nearby Southwest states spent the time recovering from the damage wrought by torrential rains. California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado late Thursday afternoon proclaimed a state of emergency for Kings, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties, to expedite government assistance and aid to the region. Two days earlier, a similar order was issued -- by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- for Kern, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo and Tulare counties. Maldonado is serving as acting governor while Schwarzenegger is out of the state. The series of Pacific fronts pounded southern California hardest, but the storms also strafed western Arizona, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah, which all were under flood watches and warnings that stretched until early Friday morning. Mudslides remain a threat because of the soggy ground. Conditions cleared in much of those areas Thursday, but the damage left by days of seemingly nonstop rain remained. That meant the chore of the day was cleaning up mud and flood damage to many homes and businesses. They may not have long to dry out: The National Weather Service forecasts that another storm system could dump light to moderate rainfall on much of southern California on Christmas Day and Sunday. Rainfall accumulation measurements at airports in Los Angeles, Long Beach, Camarillo, Santa Barbara and Santa Maria for the month -- ranging from 6 to 8.9 inches -- made this December the wettest ever in each of those locales, even with more than a week still to go. In one stark image, the field and sprawling parking lot of Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego was under water early Thursday, as crews worked desperately to pump out water. They succeeded, as the Naval Academy and San Diego State University faced off in college football's Poinsettia Bowl. The Mojave River was one of many at dangerously high levels, reaching 16.6 feet -- 0.6 feet above flood stage -- at 11 a.m. Thursday. The heavy rains also produced potential health hazards for swimmers and surfers on particular parts of Los Angeles' beaches, and Los Angeles County officials warned recreational users to be careful when next to drains or waterways because they carry bacteria and trash from streets and mountainsides. ""Fortunately, discharging storm drains, creeks, and rivers only comprises a small portion of the beach, and therefore, anybody who wants to go to the beach will be able to enjoy their outing,"" said Jonathan E. Fielding, the county's public health director and health officer. Throughout the Southwest, water roared through desert washes and urban waterways alike, and the ferocious strength of the rapids often damaged bridges or suburban concrete creek beds -- and dumped mud everywhere. The series of storms is known as the ""Pineapple Express"" because of its origin near the Hawaiian Islands. The upside to the severe weather, according to experts, is the relief the heavy rainfall has brought to a region devastated by drought and fires. The storms also brought heavy snow to mountain areas in California and other states. The National Weather Service issued hazardous weather outlooks for northern Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and most of Colorado. An avalanche warning was in effect for parts of Colorado. And locally heavy snow was forecast for much of the country's midsection, with the weather agency issuing advisories from Kansas east to Ohio.

730,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Longtime Hollywood publicist Ronni Chasen was gunned down on Sunset Boulevard early Tuesday, just minutes after she left a star-studded party to celebrate the premiere of the movie ""Burlesque,"" police said. ""We were all on such a high,"" songwriter Diane Warren said. ""And then she left -- I'm guessing about 10 minutes before I did. What on earth? What happened? Why?"" Chasen, 64, died when ""multiple shots"" were fired into her Mercedes seconds after she drove past the posh Beverly Hills Hotel on her way home, according to Beverly Hill Police Sgt. Lincoln Hoshino. Police found her car crashed into a light pole after responding to a report of gunfire heard near the intersection of Sunset and Whittier Drive at 12:20 a.m. (3:20 a.m. ET), Police Sgt. Robert Maycott said. Chasen died later at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, according to Lt. Fred Corral, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner. Detectives searched Chasen's West Los Angeles home and her public relations firm for clues Tuesday, but Hoshino called it ""a wide open investigation."" They have no suspects or motive for the attack, he said. Warren, who was Chasen's celebrity client, called the killing senseless. ""They didn't steal anything,"" she said. ""Her purse was still there."" Chasen had been on the red carpet at Grauman's Chinese Theatre walking with Warren as she and ""Burlesque"" star Cher were interviewed about the music in the film. Warren, who contributed a song to the movie's soundtrack, said Chasen also went with her to the after-party at Hollywood's W Hotel. ""I am devastated beyond belief,"" Warren said. ""I can't believe this. I can't believe this."" Michael Levine, head of Levine Communications Office, called Chasen a ""beloved, iconic figure."" Levine, who said he has known Chasen for 25 years, has started a reward fund with a goal of raising $25,000 by next week. ""We must do everything possible to assist the Beverly Hills police in solving this horrific crime,"" Levine said. ""Ronni gave the utmost for her clients and this industry."" Hollywood celebrity public relations is ""like a small family,"" said Edward Lozzi, who operates a small Beverly Hills firm. Chasen was a ""class act"" and ""the ultimate professional,"" Lozzi said. Chasen was ""so good promoting great films,"" and had special talent for creating pre-Oscar buzz for her acting clients, publicist Steve Jaffe said. CNN's Denise Quan and David Daniel contributed to this report.","NEW: ""We were all on such a high"" before the shooting, her client says .

731,"(CNN) -- Federal authorities were investigating Friday the circumstances of a drone that crashed in El Paso, Texas, this week, which U.S. officials said originated in Mexico. Mexican Attorney General spokeswoman Rocio Torres denied her country's involvement with the drone Friday, but later in the day, another Mexican official said the drone was being operated by the Ministry of Public Security and was following a target at the time of the mechanical malfunction. The Mexican official did not know the nature of the surveillance but said ""we know they were following a target."" He did not know how the malfunction affected that operation, if at all. Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in the United States, also said the drone belonged to Mexico and was part of an operation in coordination with the U.S. government. ""It was flying on the Mexican side of the border when it had a mechanical malfunction,"" Alday said. ""It is my understanding both Mexican and U.S. authorities were fully cognizant of what was going on in the area."" Alday said the drone malfunctioned, entered U.S. airspace and landed in El Paso. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Special Operations Supervisor Ramiro Cordero said a resident called his agency Tuesday evening ""about something in front of his property."" The agency picked up the device and consulted with officials in the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Consulate in Juarez, Mexico. ""We determined it was the property of the Mexican government,"" Cordero said. U.S. National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway said he believed that the drone ""was owned by the government of Mexico, and I think they were the operators."" ""We are collecting data,"" Holloway said. ""We are not sending anyone down to the scene. We are collecting information to see what occurred."" A U.S. government official said authorities are ""100 percent"" sure that the drone belonged to the Mexican government, which used it for law enforcement and homeland security. Operators lost control of the drone, and it crashed, the official said. Another U.S. official said the drone flew out of control. He described it as small, with a 6-foot wingspan. ""They are little. They are squirrelly. A gust of wind can wreak havoc on these things,"" the second official said. A parachute deployed before it hit the ground, and the drone was found intact, with no one hurt and no property damage, the official said. ""There is nothing to suggest that there was any kind of surveillance activity that was going on with anything used by the government of Mexico in U.S. airspace,"" the official said. ""There is nothing to support that they were spying on us,"" the official added. ""There is nothing to cause alarm or suspicion."" A spokesman for NORAD, which is responsible for the aerial defense of the United States, said that it had real-time awareness of the situation but that it was not deemed to be a threat and did not require any NORAD response. NORAD said the Federal Aviation Administration and its Mexican counterpart are responsible for the civil airspace over their respective countries and coordinate cross-border air traffic. Officials with the Mexican military, which also uses drones, didn't respond immediately to calls for comment. The crash of an unmanned aerial vehicle from Mexico would be a first on U.S. soil, Cordero said. He said U.S. Homeland Security has turned the drone over to the Mexican Federal Secretariat of Public Safety in Juarez. Holloway said the craft was an Orbiter Mini UAV designed by Aeronautics Defense Systems, whose website describes it as ""a compact and lightweight system designed for use in military and homeland security operations"" and ""the ultimate solution for over-the-hill reconnaissance missions, low-intensity conflicts and urban warfare operations."" Unmanned drones are routinely used by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to look for illegal immigration on the U.S.-Mexico border.

732,"Chicago (CNN) -- A fire that killed two Chicago firefighters and injured 17 earlier this week grew from wood or trash burning in the ""rear portion of the building,"" the fire department said Friday. An ""open-flame ignition of ordinary combustibles,"" such as wood or rubbish, led to Wednesday's blaze, Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said in a news release. There had not been any gas or electric service in the abandoned building -- located on the city's south side -- for months, he added. The Chicago police department has opened a criminal investigation into the fire, Langford said. On Wednesday, Fire Commissioner Robert Hoff said the building was boarded up in the front but the back was open, leading firefighters to think that homeless people may have sought shelter there. The casualties came after a wall and roof of the commercial building, which is on East 75th Street, collapsed without warning. Hoff told reporters Wednesday afternoon that none of the injuries was life-threatening. At that time, one firefighter was in stable condition, he said. The commissioner identified those killed as Corey Ankum, who had been with the department less than two years, and 12-year veteran Edward Stringer. Both were inside the structure. Other firefighters were working the blaze from the roof. CNN affiliate WGN aired footage of a line of firefighters saluting one body as it arrived at the medical examiner's office later Wednesday. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley issued a statement saying, ""The deaths of Firefighters Stringer and Ankum are both a sad reminder of how much gratitude we owe our first responders and a tragedy for all Chicagoans."" The deaths came on the 100th anniversary of the Chicago Stockyards fire, which killed 21 firefighters and the city fire marshal. The fire was reported shortly before 7 a.m. in the office area of the building, Langford said. The routine fire call became a multiple-alarm blaze after part of the roof collapsed as firefighters were inside, he said. Ankum, Stringer and two other firefighters were trapped by the collapse. The commissioner said Wednesday that investigators will look at whether ice or weather was a factor, as well as the age of the building and its heavy roof. ""There are things that happen when buildings are aged, and that could have been one of the contributing factors in this case,"" Hoff said. Langford said it was his understanding that both of the fallen firefighters had children. While the loss of a firefighter is always a tragedy, he said, ""it's been compounded"" by the deaths occurring so close to the holidays.

733,"London (CNN) -- Britain's Royal Mail has added nearly 14,000 extra rounds for its postal deliverers, hoping to clear a huge holiday backlog caused by winter weather woes. The service said it planned to complete 7,000 extra delivery routes Sunday, bringing packages, cards and letters to a million homes and addresses in an effort to catch up on deliveries during what it calls Britain's coldest December in decades. About 6,500 extra deliveries were made last Sunday in the areas hardest hit by the severe weather, Royal Mail said. ""This is already the worst December weather the UK has seen for almost 30 years,"" Mark Higson, managing director of Royal Mail, said in a statement. ""We are planning up 7,000 delivery rounds this Sunday as we continue our drive to deliver items as quickly as possible."" Online retailers are feeling the chill, too. Amazon.com's UK service has halted taking orders for its special rush delivery option and recommends giving e-gift cards instead of packages. Retailer Marks & Spencer also said that it could no longer guarantee that orders placed now would arrive in time for Christmas, except for flowers. Royal Mail had previously announced plans to add up to 3,000 extra workers and 250 delivery trucks to brave the icy roads. It warned there's little time left to get packages delivered. Tuesday is the deadline for first-class mail and packets that customers want to arrive in time for Christmas, Royal Mail said.

734,"New York (CNN) -- Performances of the troubled Broadway musical ""Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark"" are scheduled to resume Thursday evening after a performer was injured during a show, a spokesman said. The show's producers acted on the guidance of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York State Department of Labor, according to spokesman Rick Miramontez. During Monday's performance, 31-year-old Christopher Tierney fell at least 20 feet and was hospitalized. Earlier, Broadway actor Adam Pascal called for the prosecution of the show's director, Julie Taymor, because of a series of recent mishaps, including Tierney's injury. ""They should put Julie Taymor in jail for assault!"" Pascal posted on the social networking site Facebook. He called for lawsuits against Taymor and others invested in the production, such as musical stars Bono and David Howell Evans. Pascal later recanted the comments, saying, ""I think some of you missed the intended humor in my post, although my anger is real, I don't think anyone should sue Bono and the Edge you dummy! Or put Julie Taymor in jail you double dummy. I was making a point."" Pascal's representative, Rich Aronstein from RJ productions, confirmed the posts were authentic. The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and Howell (aka The Edge), is the most expensive in Broadway history, but production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems. Taymor said the accident was ""obviously heartbreaking for our entire team and, of course, to me personally."" ""I am so thankful that Chris is going to be all right and is in great spirits,"" Taymor said in a statement Tuesday. ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our Spider-Man family and we'll continue to do everything in our power to protect the cast and crew."" Tierney was initially listed in serious condition at Bellevue Hospital. The fall that injured him was caused by human error, the Actors Equity Association, a performers' union, said Wednesday. On Tuesday, the ""Spider-Man"" company met with officials from the union, as well as representatives of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York State Department of Labor. The union did not give details on the error, but the group said it worked with the other agencies to develop a safety plan to address the issue. Initially, only the Wednesday matinee performance was postponed after the incident, and performances were to resume Wednesday evening.","An actor fell during the performance and was hospitalized on Monday .

735,"CIANJUR, Indonesia (CNN)  -- More than a day after a major earthquake jolted Indonesia's Java Island, killing at least 57 people, there is still no word from remote villages along the coast, a relief worker told CNN Thursday. Soldiers try to dig out the body of a victim buried by a landslide caused by the earthquake. ""This earthquake has injured hundreds of people and (destroyed or damaged) thousands of houses,"" World Vision's Katarina Hardono said. ""We worry that the number can be easily more because in many places, actually the coastal areas, we still (haven't gotten) any news."" Rescuers are still searching for dozens of people feared trapped in a quake-triggered landslide in Cianjur in West Java. They pulled several bodies from the rubble Thursday bringing the death toll from the quake to 57. ""The death count has been thankfully low, but we have to remember that tens of thousands of homes have been damaged or destroyed and children and adults are urgently in need of relief items,"" said Hardono, who spoke to CNN from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Rainfall Thursday hampered the rescue efforts in Cianjur, where the landslide buried at least 11 homes where 32 people live, local officials said.  Watch description of the evacuation after the quake hit » . Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono visited Cianjur, and vowed to free up nearly $500,000 (5 billion rupiahs) for emergency response efforts, according to the state-run Antara news agency. He said there was no need for foreign assistance just yet. ""Until now the Indonesian government is still able to handle it by itself using existing national resources,"" he said, according to Antara. Rescuers in Cianjur used their hands and rudimentary tools to try to pry away the rocks, some that were bigger than cars. No heavy machinery could be brought in to help in the rescue effort because many roads in the area were blocked.

It is located on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In 2004, an earthquake measuring at least 9.0 in magnitude struck off the coast of the northern tip of Indonesia's Sumatra island, triggering a major tsunami in the Indian Ocean that killed more than 200,000 people in 11 countries. About three weeks ago, a series of earthquakes -- ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to 6.7 -- struck off the western coast of Sumatra. At least seven people were injured and one building collapsed.

736,"(CNN) -- Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris was rebounding Saturday after hundreds of flights were canceled because of a shortage of de-icing fluid during snow and ice that snarled air traffic across Europe, authorities said. Flight delays at de Gaulle were expected to decrease as the day went on. Officials could not give an exact number of flight cancellations. The weather improved Saturday and shipments of de-icing fluid from Charlotte, North Carolina, and Germany, will help alleviate future problems, officials said. Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, minister for transportation and ecology, said she wants more information on the fluid shortage. About 300 people who spent the night at the airport were provided with food and blankets, officials said. Transport ministry official Thierry Mariani paid them a visit and volunteers provided stuff animals for children and gifts of chocolate. Some passengers and others were critical of what happened at de Gaulle, but officials blamed the situation largely on the weather. Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeoan told the news agency AFP the airline had not been informed of the problems. ""It is surprising and somewhat [impermissible] that an airport such as Roissy Charles de Gaulle could experience such a supply problem. It is an isolated case in Europe,"" said Gourgeoan. Meanwhile, the Brussels, Belgium, airport reported that operations were nearly back to normal Saturday, with two of three runways operational. Gatwick Airport and Heathrow Airports in London said airlines were operating, but some delays or cancellations were possible. Airports across Europe are still struggling to get passengers to their destinations after they were snarled by unexpected snow over the weekend. Nearly 2,000 passengers at de Gaulle were moved from Terminal 2E to other parts of the airport on Friday because of the weight of snow on a roof, French authorities said, calling the measure ""preventative."" Part of the roof of that terminal collapsed in 2004, shortly after the state-of-the-art building was inaugurated. Four people were killed, media reports at the time said. About a foot of snow had fallen on the roof Friday by the time authorities decided to close the terminal, French media reports said. French authorities earlier Friday asked airlines to cancel half their morning flights to and from the airport because the de-icing fluid was running low. That led to the cancellation of 400 flights Friday morning -- 200 arrivals and 200 departures. Then, early in the afternoon, authorities asked airlines to scrap a third of their flights for the rest of the day. Charles de Gaulle is the second busiest airport in Europe, after Heathrow in London. Paris' second airport, Orly, has not had to cancel flights because it is not running out of glycol, which is using for de-icing, authorities said. CNN's Niki Cook and Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","NEW: Officials will investigate de-icing fluid shortage .

738,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The cholera epidemic already blamed for more than 1,100 deaths in Haiti could worsen because of poor sanitation in the earthquake-ravaged country, U.S. medical researchers reported Thursday. A lack of treated drinking water, coupled with poor hand hygiene and food-preparation practices, make the 1.3 million people still living in camps particularly vulnerable, according to a new study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""The course of the cholera outbreak in Haiti is difficult to predict,"" the report states. ""The Haitian population has no pre-existing immunity to cholera, and environmental conditions in Haiti are favorable for its continued spread."" Jordan Tappero, a CDC epidemiologist in Haiti, said Haitian authorities and aid agencies are working to limit the epidemic by emphasizing clean water and sanitation. But he added, ""We expect we will be working very hard for many months to come."" Haiti has not reported a cholera outbreak in more than a century. The current epidemic was first reported in October and has now spread to eight of the Caribbean nation's 10 provinces, the CDC found. Reports linking the outbreak to Nepalese troops from the U.N. peacekeeping mission MINUSTAH sparked riots in the northern port city of Cap-Haitien on Tuesday. A new round of violent protests erupted Thursday in the capital Port-au-Prince, eyewitnesses told CNN. U.N. officials have denied the Nepalese were to blame for the outbreak. The CDC has said the strain of the cholera bacteria responsible is ""indistinguishable"" from one found in other parts of the world, including south Asia, but researchers are unlikely to be able to pinpoint how it arrived in Haiti. ""The reality is that we have a serious problem here,"" CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said. The emphasis is on controlling the outbreak, ""so that more people do not become ill and potentially die from cholera."" The epidemic comes as Haiti -- already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere -- struggles to recover from the January earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people. Even before the quake, only 12 percent of the Haitian population of 9.8 million received treated tap water and only 17 percent had access to adequate sanitation, the CDC noted. ""The water safety and sanitation systems in Haiti were weak be before the earthquake and made weaker by the earthquake, so conditions are ripe for the further spread of cholera,"" Tappero told CNN. Some symptoms of cholera, an acute, bacterial illness caused by drinking tainted water, can be mild or even nonexistent. But the disease can cause profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, leading to death by rapid dehydration. The heart of the outbreak is the Haitian province of Artibonite, north of Port-au-Prince. Interviews with victims hospitalized in the first days of the outbreak found that two-thirds of them had been drinking untreated water from rivers or canals, the same percentage did not routinely use chlorine to sanitize drinking water and nearly four out of five defecated in the open. And as the current outbreak spreads, infected people could spread the disease further by preparing food without proper hygiene, the CDC reported. ""The way to prevent acquiring cholera when sanitation is poor is to take your water from a clean water source or treat water yourself in the home, and use good sanitary practices with clean water when preparing and cooking food,"" Tappero said. CNN's Miriam Falco and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","U.S. report says the cholera outbreak's course is ""difficult to predict""

739,"(CNN) -- An Arlington, Texas, police officer was among three people killed in a shooting at an apartment complex Tuesday night, officials said. It was at least the second fatal shooting in two days of a law enforcement officer in the United States. On Monday, a Georgia state trooper was fatally shot after a traffic stop in northwest Atlanta. In the Arlington incident, the officer had been dispatched to an apartment complex to check out a report of domestic assault, city spokeswoman Tiara Richard told reporters. ""Shortly afterwards, officers received a call of a shooting at the same  location.  When officers arrived, they found  three people deceased here in an apartment at the complex. One of those people  was an officer,"" she said. Authorities did not immediately release the name of the victims. ""It's a tragic  situation. Our hearts are broken tonight,"" Mayor Robert Cluck said in a statement. In January, another Arlington police officer died in the line of duty, Richard said. Officer Craig Story was killed when his motorcycle struck a school bus about a mile away from Tuesday's shooting scene, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. ""Any time you lose an officer who  is working in the line of duty -- or not in the line of duty -- it's hard on the  department,"" Richard told reporters. ""It's hard on the city as a whole. These are people who day in and  day out, they go out and do their job and they are doing it to protect the  citizens here.  It's a hard loss for anyone...especially during this time of  year."" Meanwhile, Georgia officials have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of the state trooper late Monday. Trooper Chadwick LeCroy, 38 was shot twice in the face following the traffic stop and he died en route to a hospital, a state patrol spokesman said. The suspect escaped in the trooper's patrol car, which was found abandoned about half a mile away. Shortly afterward, he was taken into custody, the spokesman said. CNN's Samuel Gardner contributed to this report.","The officer was dispatched to the apartments on a domestic assualt report .

740,"(CNN) -- Snow fell in parts of the southeast Saturday, the leading edge of a powerful storm system that has prompted blizzard warnings in New York City and Boston and threatened to cause major travel headaches at the tail end of the holiday week. The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning for the New York City metropolitan area, from northeast New Jersey through Newark and New York, and including the entirety of both the Long Island and Connecticut coasts of the Long Island Sound. That warning is in effect between 6 a.m. Sunday and 6 p.m. Monday. Forecasters predict between 11 to 16 inches of blowing snow in much of that region, bringing visibility to near zero at times. Sustained winds as strong as 30 miles per hour could hit Sunday night, with gusts up to 55 mph in parts of central and eastern Long Island. And, starting at noon Sunday and extending through 6 p.m. Monday, a similar warning is out for all of Rhode Island and most of eastern Massachusetts. Parts of that region could see as much as 20 inches of snow, with strong winds contributing to near blinding travel conditions and likely significant power outages. The weather service also put out a blizzard watch from Sunday evening through Monday afternoon for coastal New Hampshire and Maine, up to the Canadian border. All this could put a wrench in thousands of travel plans. Continental Airlines, which is partnered with United Airlines, has canceled about 250 domestic mainline and regional departures for Sunday, spokesman Andrew J. Ferraro said. American Airlines spokeswoman Mary Sanderson said that the airline expected minimal delays through Sunday morning, but that it plans to cancel flights in and out of several key East Coast airports starting in the afternoon. ""Customers will be contacted through the automated re-accommodation system ... as early as tonight,"" Sanderson said. ""We'll have a better idea tomorrow morning."" Delta Air Lines, too, has begun cancelling some flights, though it expects to have a better handle of how many cancellations will be needed on Sunday morning ""once we've worked through the schedule,"" spokesman Kent Landers said. Earlier, the carrier cancelled approximately 500 Christmas Day flights -- including roughly 300 in and out of Atlanta -- in an attempt to get ahead of the storm, Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said. Delta has joined Continental, United, American, AirTran Airways and other carriers in waiving penalties for travelers who have to reschedule their trips over the weekend. While specific information varies by carrier, most are offering penalty waivers for passengers traveling on December 26 and 27 at airports from North Carolina to Boston and beyond. Affected customers are being urged to contact the relevant airline either by phone or online. Winter storm warnings were in effect late Saturday afternoon and into Sunday in parts of Georgia north to Virginia, with the rest of the East Coast set to follow as the weekend progresses. A band of light snowfall was moving across the Tennessee Valley and the southern Appalachians, according to the National Weather Service. Madison, Alabama, had received 2.2 inches of snow since Thursday. Snowfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches were possible across North Carolina, and Atlanta was receiving afternoon precipitation. Picturesque Asheville in western North Carolina was well on its way Saturday to notching up to 8 inches of snow. Light flakes were falling in Washington on Saturday, a precurso to heavier snowfall expected to arrive midday Sunday. Accumulations are expected to be between 2 and 4 inches. Forecasters, too, warned of icy driving conditions across much of the East. Much of the precipitation will fall along the Interstate 95 corridor and near the Atlantic coast. CNN meteorologist Bonnie Schneider explained that the system is a Nor'easter, which gets its name from the continuously strong northeasterly winds blowing in from the ocean ahead of the storm and over the coastal areas.

741,"(CNN) -- A part of Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris was evacuated Friday due to the accumulation of snow on the roof and hundreds of flights were canceled because of a shortage of de-icing fluid, authorities said, as blustery winter weather snarled travel across Europe. Nearly 2,000 passengers were moved from Terminal 2E to other parts of the airport, French authorities said, calling the measure ""preventative."" Part of the roof of that terminal collapsed in 2004, shortly after the state-of-the-art building was inaugurated. Four people were killed, media reports at the time said. About a foot of snow had fallen on the roof Friday by the time authorities decided to close the terminal, French media reports said. Authorities were working to clear it and reopen the terminal. French authorities earlier Friday asked airlines to cancel half their morning flights to and from the airport because de-icing fluid was running low, they said. That led to the cancellation of 400 flights Friday morning -- 200 arrivals and 200 departures. Then, early in the afternoon, authorities asked airlines to scrap a third of their flights for the rest of the day. Charles de Gaulle is the second busiest airport in Europe, after Heathrow in London. By Friday evening, conditions there were improving, and flights on Christmas Day were predicted to depart as scheduled. Authorities have said that as many as 200 passengers may spend the night at the airport, where some 800 mattresses were set up in a makeshift dormitory. Elsewhere at Charles de Gaulle Friday, a chartered plane arrived safely carrying 84 Haitian children, who are to be adopted by French families, the government said. Medical and logistical supplies met the flight. Paris' second airport, Orly, has not had to cancel flights because it is not running out of glycol, which is using for de-icing, authorities said. Despite the winter weather, Air France said it intended to operate all of its flights between the Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports. It also said it intended to operate all of its long-haul flights. Airports across Europe are still struggling to get passengers to their destinations after they were snarled by unexpected snow over the weekend. In Brussels, heavy snowfall forced the closure of all but one runway, the airport said in a statement. It was only accepting a few flights, as the airport said it did not have sufficient capacity to handle incoming traffic. Heathrow, in London, said in a statement that it was open and that most flights would operate on Friday. London's Gatwick Airport similarly said it was open and that flights were operating, but it warned there may be some delays and cancellations because of snowfall across Northern Europe. Dublin, Ireland's airport was experiencing delays Friday because of de-icing and because airplanes were in the wrong places after the week's disruptions, the airport said in a statement. At the Frankfurt airport in Germany, most flights were operating as scheduled but some were scratched and others were delayed, said duty officer Heinz Fass. About 45 landings and 35 starts were canceled, he said, because of winter weather at other European airports. Meanwhile, the Swedish Transport Administration wrote on its website that the traffic situation was ""extremely alarming"" and that there were major problems with both road and rail traffic, especially in the southern parts of the country. The problems there are expected to continue through Christmas Day.

742,"(CNN) -- The worst might be over on Indonesia's Mount Merapi volcano, disaster officials said Thursday. They urged calm in the aftermath of recent eruptions, which started on October 26 and have killed 191 people. ""Generally speaking, Mount Merapi has passed its dangerous phase,"" the National Agency for Disaster Management said. It cited recent eruptions versus historic ones. Merapi's recent eruptions have released about 140 million cubic meters of magma, the disaster agency said. The previous record flow occurred in 1872, at 100 million cubic meters. The information was released in an attempt to reassure Indonesians, especially those in the Yogyakarta and Central Java area. Despite that, government volcanology experts have kept Merapi's alert level at 4, the highest. On Wednesday, the Merapi Disaster Health Team said that the recent eruptions have seriously injured 145 people, and left scores of others less severely hurt. The eruptions have displaced nearly 344,000 residents, many who are now living in refugee camps, the National Agency for Disaster Management said. To restore a sense of normalcy for displaced students, classes have started at the camps, disaster officials said Thursday. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called the volcano eruptions a crisis situation. Over the weekend, he and several of his ministers visited Yogyakarta to oversee relief efforts. On Thursday, disaster officials said dredging has begun. The work is being done to limit further destruction. ""We've taken steps to anticipate possible lava floods from upstream,"" said Syamsul Maarif, the head of the National Agency for Disaster Management. The 3,000-meter (9,800-foot) Merapi, in Central Java, is famously unpredictable. About 1,300 people died when it erupted in 1930. Many people continue to live in the shadow of the volcano, raising food and livestock. The president has announced that residents will receive compensation for livelihoods and animals lost to the eruptions. The government will buy endangered cows on the volcano, Yudhoyono said. Many of those who live on its slopes risked their lives by staying or returning to feed their cows during lulls of volcanic activity.

743,"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican officials have identified 13 people killed Sunday night in a Tijuana drug rehabilitation center, the state-run news agency said Monday. Four heavily armed men stormed into the Centro de Rehabilitacion El Camino and opened fire, the Notimex news agency said. The reported ages of those killed ranged from 19 to 56 years old. The assailants escaped in a vehicle, the news agency said. The dead were identified as: Irineo Godinez Garcia, 47; Antonio Mesa Contreras, 56; Bernabe Alvarez Piceno, 35; Jose Lopez Sauceda, 28; Fabian Gonzalez Zea, 19; Juan Daniel Casi Esquer, 32; Wilson Ramírez Pena, 42; Joaquin García Hernandez, 39; Jorge Palacio Goya, 37; Pedro Villegas, 30; Juan Roberto Sanchez Ortega, 30; Edwin Vargas Avila, 33; and Salvador Bustos, 30. The slayings occurred one day after armed men burst into a house party in Ciudad Juarez and opened fire, killing 14 people and wounding 14, Notimex said. The ages of those killed in Juarez ranged from 14 to 30, Notimex said. Children as young as 7 and 11 were among the injured, the agency reported. The attack in Juarez was reminiscent of an incident in January, when drug cartel gunmen stormed a house party and killed 15 people. Most of the victims were youths who had no ties to organized crime. Investigators said the January shooting was a case of mistaken identity caused by bad intelligence. It sparked widespread outrage in the violent border city, including calls for Mexican President Felipe Calderon to resign. The Tijuana slayings also were similar to previous attacks carried out at drug rehab centers. A massacre at a Juarez rehab facility in early June left 19 dead. Twenty-seven people were killed in September 2009 in two attacks at separate drug facilities in Ciudad Juarez, the bloodiest city in the nation. Officials said the previous attacks were done by drug gangs killing members of other gangs. At least 2,500 people have been reported killed in drug violence this year in Ciudad Juarez. Nationwide, more than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence since December 2006, when Calderon took office and stepped up efforts to fight organized crime and narcotrafficking cartels. Much of the violence in Ciudad Juarez and other areas of northern Mexico is due to the drug cartels fighting for control of lucrative routes into the United States, authorities have said.","NEW: The attack is similar to previous killings at drug rehab centers .

744,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Volunteers flocked to a southern California community to help residents mop up last week's flood damage ahead of what meteorologists are predicting will be more rain. Five homes were destroyed and nearly 75 damaged in the San Bernardino County community of Highland when water and mud rushed through the foothill town last week, authorities said. Total damage, including the cost of cleanup and lost property value, could hit $17.2 million, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. ""We feel very fortunate to have all these volunteers just help out, without even getting paid. They're just trying to do something good for the community,"" Cesar Garcia told CNN affiliate KABC. Garcia spoke inside his home, still steeped in mud. Outside, unstable hillsides were covered in plastic while as many as 600 volunteers worked to clear the debris. They laid sandbags in a bid to divert future water flows in preparation for more rainfall, which is expected soon. The National Weather Service has forecast a storm moving into the area late Tuesday night into Wednesday. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said the storm should be much smaller than the one last week, but that it could dump as much as two inches of rain or two feet of snow in the mountains of California. Because the ground is already wet, the storm could cause problems, he said. Last week, monsoon-like conditions overwhelmed southern California, creating flash floods that kept workers at home and businesses and streets knee deep in mud and water.","The community of Highland was flooded last week .

745,"(CNN) -- Emergency crews in the Philippines were on standby Monday morning as the island nation braced for a ""super typhoon"" that could trigger flooding and landslides. Super Typhoon Megi, also known as Juan, is expected to make landfall midday Monday at or near super-typhoon strength, with winds possibly in excess of 200 kph (124 mph), according to Mario Montejo, secretary of the Philippines' science and technology. On Monday morning, Megi carried sustained winds of 287 kph (178 mph) with gusts up to 350 kph (217 mph) as it headed toward the Philippines, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said. ""Tropical storm force winds and heavy rain squalls are already affecting areas along the coast,"" CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. ""From this point forward the weather conditions are expected to rapidly deteriorate."" CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera called Megi a ""monster storm."" Beyond high winds, large swaths of the northern island of Luzon will see 300 mm (12 inches) of rain, while more isolated pockets may see up to 500 mm (20 inches), Ward said. A typhoon of this intensity could cause storm surge as high as 6 to 8 meters, threatening population centers along the coast. As of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Sunday, the typhoon was about 390 kilometers east of Aparri, Cagayan, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. It was moving west at about 22 kph. Montejo said the government is alarmed by the speed and strength of the typhoon. He warned of potentially devastating effects the storm may wreak on Luzon. ""The winds have been steadily increasing,"" James Reynolds, a storm chaser who is on Luzon, told CNN Monday morning. ""Unfortunately, this is a part of the world where the infrastructure is quite fragile, the power grid is quite fragile and a lot of people live in quite basic houses,"" he said. Residents in low-lying and coastal areas are advised to head for safer locations, and authorities are discussing the possibility of forced evacuations. As the storm moves across the rugged terrain of Luzon, it is expected to decrease in intensity before moving out over the South China Sea. Megi is expected to dump large amounts of rainfall over the mountains, which could potentially trigger mudslides and localized flooding. The typhoon could also damage large amounts of agricultural land along its path. ""Thousands of hectares are in danger of being ruined,"" Cabrera said. On Sunday, Philippine navy spokesman Lt. Col. Edgard Arevalo said in a statement that disaster response personnel equipped with rubber boats and other life-saving equipment are on standby in several areas.","NEW: Super Typhoon Megi carries sustained winds of about 287 kph (178 mph)

746,"(CNN) -- A 2009 helicopter crash in which eight people died was due to a bird striking the chopper's windshield, the National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday. ""Contributing to the accident, the board said, were the lack of [Federal Aviation Administration] regulations and guidance requiring helicopter windshields to be resistant to bird strikes,"" among other factors, the NTSB said in a news release. On January 4, 2009, a dual-engine Sikorsky S-76C helicopter crashed into marshy terrain near Morgan City, Louisiana, about seven minutes after takeoff from Amelie, Louisiana. The copter was on a charter flight to a Gulf of Mexico oil rig. Both pilots were killed, along with six of the seven passengers, according to the NTSB. Heard on the helicopter's cockpit voice recorder was a ""loud bang, followed by sounds consistent with rushing wind and a power reduction on both engines,"" according to the statement. ""The aircraft crashed several seconds later."" Feathers and other debris, identified as belonging to a red-tailed hawk, were collected from the helicopter's canopy and windshield, the NTSB said. Investigators believe the bird's impact jarred the fire extinguisher T-handles loose and moved them aft, which pushed both engine control levers into the flight idle position, reducing fuel to both engines, the statement said. ""The pilots were probably disoriented from the broken windshield and rushing air and were unable to react in time to maintain control of the helicopter."" The helicopter was registered to and operated by PHI Inc., the board said. The helicopter initially was equipped with laminated glass windshields that complied with European bird-strike resistance standards, but PHI had replaced them with lighter-weight acrylic windshields without bird-strike resistance. The crash occurred just days before pilot Chesley Sullenberger and co-pilot Jeffrey Skiles landed a US Airways flight in the Hudson River at New York City after a bird strike to the engines.

747,"(CNN) -- As rescue efforts continue Tuesday, Colombia's president will visit the mountainside neighborhood where a massive landslide buried dozens of homes. By Monday night, search crews had uncovered 23 dead bodies there, the Red Cross said, and more than 120 people could still be trapped underground. ""We are still hoping to find people alive,"" Red Cross National Deputy Director Jorge Ivan Nova said Monday. But he said survival becomes less likely as time passes. Rescuers had pulled at least seven injured people from the rubble after Sunday's landslide in Bello, Colombia, which buried between 30 and 50 homes, Nova said. Officials believe the neighborhood was particularly packed Sunday afternoon -- a time when families commonly get together for meals, he said. ""I hope they can be rescued. You could hear screams below the homes. I ask that they not stop the search. Thank God I could save my son and my husband also is alive. But I lost many loved ones,"" resident Maria Garcia told CNN affiliate Caracol TV. More than 700 people were working in shifts on search teams at the site Monday, Caracol reported. Amid the chaos of the rescue effort, a young boy tugged firefighter Carlos Garcia's belt. ""He asked me, 'firefighter, where are we going to sleep tonight?' And what most impacted me was seeing his little face. I also have a 6-year-old boy,"" Garcia told Caracol. About 150 people from the neighborhood were in nearby shelters, Caracol reported, and government officials said they were evacuating other neighborhoods in the area. ""The zone, geologically, is very unstable,"" Diego Munoz, Bello's government secretary, told Caracol. At least 194 people have been killed and 248 injured after torrential rains throughout Colombia that have affected nearly 1.6 million people, according to the country's interior ministry. The downpours have caused landslides and overflowing rivers, destroying at least 2,040 houses and damaging nearly 270,000 more nationwide, the ministry said. Colombia is considering declaring a state of emergency to devote more resources to response and rescue efforts, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said Sunday, describing the rains and flooding as ""a tragedy that has no precedent in the history of our country."" The president said he plans to travel Tuesday to Bello -- a suburb of Medellin, Colombia. ""My heart is with the victims of this terrible tragedy... In a few hours we will go directly to Medellin to be with the victims' families and tell them, 'Whatever the government can do to mitigate this pain and suffering, we will be there,'"" Santos said in a statement Monday.

748,"(CNN) -- Search crews found a second body in the ruins of a furniture store destroyed by a gas explosion in Wayne, Michigan, the city's fire chief said early Thursday. The body of a 54-year-old woman, a store employee, was pulled from the rubble of Franks Furniture around 10:45 p.m. Wednesday, according to Wayne Fire Chief Mel Moore. Earlier in the day, the body of a 64-year-old man was also recovered. He was identified only as a male employee of the store, who lived in Westland, Michigan. The store's owner, Paul Franks, 64, was pulled from the wreckage shortly after the explosion, which occurred at about 9 a.m., City Manager John Zech said. He was in serious but stable condition at the University of Michigan Hospital's burn unit. Search and rescue crews, aided by heavy equipment, continued to remove huge amounts of rubble from the scene of the blast, which damaged several buildings in addition to the furniture store. Moore said the process was made more difficult by the removal of ""thousands of pounds of concrete"" from the store's roof trusses. As many as 300 people were evacuated after the explosion and a second reported leak in a neighborhood adjoining the furniture store in the suburban Detroit city. As of Wednesday night, residents of all but nine homes were able to return, and were being offered lodging elsewhere for the night, said Debra Dodd, a spokeswoman for the gas utility, Consumers Energy. Mayor Abdul ""Al"" Haidous described Frank's Furniture as one of the ""jewels"" of the city, and said Franks has been a leader in civic life. ""He has served this city with a great deal of integrity,"" the mayor said . Before the explosion, a Consumers Energy gas worker was two blocks away investigating the reported gas leak, Dodd said. ""We don't know at this time what caused the incident this morning,"" Dodd said Wednesday night, but added that the utility will work with the state Public Service Commission in investigating.","Second body is found in the rubble of a furniture store, official says .

749,"(Health.com) -- The number of infants and toddlers under age 2 who landed in emergency rooms after ingesting too much over-the-counter cold medicine dropped by more than half following the discontinuation of medicines targeted to that age group, a new study has found. In 2007, drug manufacturers voluntarily pulled infant cough-and-cold medicines from store shelves amid concerns about the products' effectiveness and side effects, including a risk of rapid heart rate, convulsions, loss of consciousness, and even death. At the time, experts worried that parents would start dosing their toddlers with other, stronger medications, which would potentially cause even worse problems. Health.com: 9 ways to stay sniffle-free . ""There was some controversy,"" says Daniel Budnitz, M.D., a medical officer in the Medication Safety Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, Georgia. ""Some folks suggested that it would be a bad thing because parents would use adult-strength formulas for infants and not know how to dose them."" But that doesn't seem to have happened. The new study, which was co-authored by Budnitz and appears in the journal Pediatrics, found that cold medicine-related ER visits by children under the age of 2 dropped by 55 percent in the 14-month period after the product withdrawal, compared with the 14 months immediately before. Using data collected from a representative sample of 63 hospitals across the U.S., the researchers estimated that there were about 2,800 ER visits before the product withdrawal and about 1,250 after. Health.com: How to sick-proof your winter . And there did not appear to be any uptick in problems related to other medications, such as antibiotics, that parents might have been giving their children instead of cough-and-cold medicine. Both before and after the product withdrawal, the vast majority of ER visits resulted from overdoses. More than half of the children under age 2 who landed in the ER had found and ingested the medicines on their own. The remaining visits were caused by caregiver errors -- such as a parent mixing up two siblings' medicines or confusing the abbreviations for teaspoon and tablespoon, for instance. (Many of the discontinued products were liquids.) Although Budnitz and his co-authors can't say with absolute certainty that the sharp drop in ER visits was caused by the product withdrawal, it does seem likely. The overall number of ER visits among kids under 12 remained the same in the pre- and post-withdrawal periods, which suggests that the decline was limited to infants and toddlers. Health.com: 5 most common myths about the common cold . Even after the 2007 withdrawal, doctors and public-health officials have continued to question the use of cough-and-cold medicines in young children. Aside from the safety risk, research has consistently shown that pediatric products are largely ineffective at relieving symptoms. In response to the safety concerns, medicine manufacturers have taken steps to standardize their dosing devices. And in 2008, after conferring with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), they voluntarily changed their product labels to say the medicines should not be used in children under age 4. The study findings support that change, says Budnitz. Neil Herendeen, M.D., a pediatrician at the University of Rochester Medical Center, in New York, says the study provides a compelling reason to withdraw all pediatric cough-and-cold medicines for kids under 12 from the market, a policy he supports. ""This shows that if you take it off the market, it will reduce the adverse events,"" Herendeen says. Health.com: Top 7 natural cold remedies: do they work? Difficult as it is for parents to stand by and do nothing while their infants suffer with runny noses and hacking coughs, there really isn't any way to make a cold go away, only to ease some of the symptoms, experts say. ""You're left with doing all the things your grandmother used to tell you: lots of fluids; vaporizers, but don't put any menthol medications in it, just plain water; blow your nose; and salt water drops,"" Dr. Herendeen says. Jeff Sleeth, M.D., an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, says that it's important to keep a sick infant's environment as well humidified as possible. That ""allows the mucous and secretions that are in the nose and back of the throat to stay nice and thin so, [so] when the child does cough, it's easier to clear the secretions out,"" Sleeth says.

750,"(CNN) -- Heavy snowfall in Germany has caused part of the roof to collapse at the Veltins Arena, which hosts Bundesliga soccer team Schalke 04. The stadium, in Gelsenkirchen, stages all Schalke's home games and was also due to hold the annual biathlon World Team Challenge later this week. But the event has been cancelled after a deluge of snow over Christmas created a hole measuring 1,000 square meters in the roof. Three fibre glass strips that hold the roof in place were destroyed. ""The holes are not going to be closed in time,'' Schalke's chairman Peter Peters said of the biathlon on the club's official website. ""The safety of the spectators is the utmost priority.'' Football's heroes and villains of 2010 . The Bundesliga is currently on its winter break, with Schalke not scheduled to play at the Veltins Arena until the January 15 clash with Hamburg. But that match is not thought to be in danger, as it can be played with the roof open. ""I am optimistic that we will be able to start the second half of the season according to schedule,"" Peters said. Staff had cleared an earlier downfall prior to Christmas but were unable to get onto the roof after that due to harsh weather conditions. The stadium was opened in 2001 and can hold 61,482 spectators. It played host to the 2004 UEFA Champions League final and staged five games in the 2006 World Cup.","Heavy snow causes part of the roof at Schalke's Veltins Arena to collapse .

751,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesian officials have gone on high alert and have started evacuations as they warily monitor Mount Merapi, a volatile volcano in central Java that might erupt at any time. ""The local government is coordinating to evacuate around 40,000 villagers to the pre-assigned shelters,"" Neulis Auliasari of the national disaster coordination board said Monday. Seismic activity has intensified, signaling that an eruption is imminent, according to Indonesian volcanologists. The 3,000-meter Merapi is famously unpredictable, though. A pyroclastic flow -- a fast-moving burst of blistering gases and rock fragments -- is a key concern. One killed two people in 2006 and another killed more than 60 villagers in 1994. About 1,300 people died when Merapi erupted in 1930.","About 40,000 nearby villagers have started evacuating .

752,"(CNN) -- A doctor in Fiji is examining three teenage boys rescued 240 miles from land after they were lost in the South Pacific for more than 50 days. Apunas Sakamuri, spokesman for the police department in Suva, Fiji, said the three were admitted to Suva Public Hospital and then released to a private doctor identified as Dr. Rosemary Mitchell. Filo Filo, 15, and his cousins -- Etueni Nasau, 14, and Samu Pelesa, 15 -- were famished, dehydrated, exhausted and sunburned when a crew member on a fishing boat two miles away spotted their 12-foot metal boat and alerted his superior. The rescue, which came two weeks after hundreds turned out to mourn them, elated their friends and relatives. Tanu Filo, whose 15-year-old son Filo was among the survivors, told CNN Thursday in a telephone interview from his native Tokelau Islands that, ""I was on cloud nine. I was so joyful."" ""I couldn't believe my son and his boys were found again. Unbelievable,"" said Tanu Filo, who noted that a traditional celebration is now in order. ""He alerted us that he saw something immediately on our bow, directly in front of us,"" Tai Fredricsen told CNN Thursday from his 280-foot tuna boat. ""As we drew closer, we could tell that it was a small boat of some type."" The boat was a strange find so far from land. ""It's not something you go in the open ocean with,"" he said, noting that the boat was 240 miles northeast of Fiji when it was spotted late Tuesday afternoon. And it got stranger. Inside were three naked teenage boys -- cousins from the Tokelau Islands 750 nautical miles away. Asked whether they needed help, they said yes. When he learned how long they had been adrift, Fredricsen released his rescue boat, took them aboard his fishing boat, the San Nikunau. ""They looked very bad -- bones protruding from underneath the skin, but mentally strong, strong as an ox,"" Fredricsen said. He moved them to his cabin's king-sized bed, where ""they all fit comfortably,"" and began administering first aid to their burned skin. ""They were ecstatic,"" he said. He also gave them electrolyte-spiked liquids as he had been trained to do in a first-aid class. ""I just gave them very small doses -- they more or less let the drink stay in their mouth and they swirled it around and let it absorb in their cheeks very slowly."" After about half an hour, they were able to swallow, but he urged them to go slowly. ""They knew I was trying to help, and they did what I said. The cooperation was just incredible from the start."" After a couple of hours, they were able to eat small pieces of dry white bread, he said. Four hours later, he was feeding them slices of oranges and apples. ""And then they were starting to get a little bit carried away -- they were wanting some McDonald's or some French fries, but I couldn't allow them to have that yet."" After six hours on board, the three teenage boys began to mingle with the crew. By 4:30 a.m. local time Thursday, they were transferred to a Fiji coast guard vessel, destined for a hospital in Suva on that Pacific island, ""hopefully warm and cozy."" Throughout, the boys were smiling, he said. Natives of the Tokelau Islands -- three small atolls in the Pacific Ocean, about midway between New Zealand and Hawaii -- the boys said they had set out in the boat in early October to travel from one island to another, Fredricsen said. ""The islands are pretty close and they can be transited quite easily with these small vessels,"" but they got disoriented after losing sight of land, ""and that was it,"" he said. The boys said they had left their island with enough coconuts to keep them hydrated for two days, he said. But they used a tarpaulin to catch rainwater and for shelter after their clothes disintegrated. And two weeks ago, they caught a seabird, which they ate, he said. About the same time, authorities had concluded that the teens could not have survived and declared them dead. Two weeks ago, their families and friends held a memorial service attended by 500 people, in the island chain that has a total population of 1,400, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. But their rescue came just in the nick of time. ""They did admit to me they had started drinking salt water two days prior to us rescuing them,"" Fredricsen said. Drinking excess amounts of saltwater can shut down one's kidneys, which can be fatal. The boys were spotted in an ""unusual place"" -- west of the Tokelaus, between western Samoa and Fiji, said Eric Barratt, the managing director for the Sanford seafood company, whose boat found the boys. It was dumb luck that the fishing boat came upon the boys, said Fredricsen, since its usual port of unloading and operations is in American Samoa. ""By chance, we were going to New Zealand to unload"" because the boat was scheduled to be pulled from the water and inspected, a quadrennial event, he said. Fredricsen called the Tokelau Islands and informed Pelesa's grandmother of his unusual catch. ""I just told her we found her kids, and it was total hysteria,"" Fredricsen said. ""It was just amazing."" Pelesa's uncle, Lakia Kalolo, told CNN that Pelesa's grandmother broke the news to him and others. ""You should have seen the village, you should have seen the people here,"" he said. ""They were happy, very happy. Everybody was crying ... We gave thanks to God."" Tanu Filo described a similar scene, with singing and hugging among the villagers when the good news arrived. But when Filo Filo first phoned his father from the boat, ""he cried more than he talked,"" his father Tanu recalled. ""I can tell you that he's tired and all, from the way he speaks,"" Tanu . Filo said. ""But he was so happy."" Fredricsen said the boys left their mark on him and his crewmates -- not only because of what they endured while lost at sea, but because of their attitudes after rescue. ""It was just an uplifting experience to meet these young men,"" Fredricsen said. ""They didn't give up."" Tanu Filo said locals are ""trying to plan a celebration in a Tokelean way."" Besides the boys, he would like the tuna boat's captain and crew to join in the celebratory eating, singing and joy. ""I'd like to say thanks, and shake hands and celebrate ... together,"" Tanu Filo said. ""We want to invite them to the feast."" -- CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Tom Watkins contributed to this story.","Father of teen calls rescue ""unbelievable,"" invites ship's crew to celebrate .

753,"(CNN) -- Six people, including one minor, were killed Sunday in a natural gas explosion at a resort in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, authorities and state media reported. Another 15 or so were injured, according to the local attorney general's office, with the injured including employees of the hotel and tourists from Canada and the United States. The U.S. State Department said two of those injured were Americans. One of the Canadian victims was a minor, Notimex, Mexico's state news agency reported. Earlier, authorities had said that as many as 20 people could have been injured in the blast. The explosion was likely caused by a buildup of natural gas that somehow ignited, but the official cause is under investigation, the attorney general's office said. Police Commander Arturo Guillermo had said earlier that a gas line or stove exploded at the Grand Riviera Princess. Video from the scene on Mexico's east coast showed debris spilled into a grassy area in front of an area covered by thatched roofs where the restaurant presumably sits. The explosion happened around 9 a.m. Sunday morning in the lobby of the hotel. Emergency personnel responded and transferred the injured people to an area hospital for treatment. ""Right now we have personnel on site,"" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Gini Staab. The two injured Americans were taken to a hospital, she said. Authorities, including consular agents and a consular officer, were on site at the hotel assisting U.S. citizens staying there, according to Staab.

754,"(CNN) -- The death toll from a shooting at a house party in the violence-plagued Mexican border city of Juarez has climbed to 14, state media reported Sunday. Chihuahua State Attorney General Carlos Manuel Salas told reporters that another 14 people were injured when gunmen attacked the gathering of young people at a house party Friday, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. The victims killed were between ages 14 and 30, Notimex said. Children as young as 7 and 11 were among the injured, the agency reported. Salas said authorities were investigating the backgrounds of all the victims. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission said it was sending representatives to the neighborhood, which was near another home where cartel gunmen stormed a house party in January, killing 15 people. Most of the victims in that shooting were youths who had no ties to organized crime. Investigators said the January shooting was a case of mistaken identity caused by bad intelligence. It sparked widespread outrage in the violent border city, including calls for Mexican President Felipe Calderon to resign. In a news conference Saturday, the country's deputy interior minister told reporters federal authorities will maintain the security strategy they are developing with state officials. ""We are here to address this deplorable and condemnable acts, and to ensure full support to local authorities investigating these unfortunate events,"" deputy interior minister Juan Marcos Gutierrez said, according to Notimex.

755,"(CNN) -- Young women at a party attended by about 50 Central Washington University students and other young people were the primary target of spiked drinks, authorities said Saturday. The incident resulted in ""multiple"" reports of overdoses. Some of the victims said they had consumed only one or two beverages before becoming ill, Cle Elum-Roslyn Police Chief Scott Ferguson said. ""Their level of intoxication just didn't seem to make sense,"" he told CNN Radio. Central Washington University students who attended the party told CNN affiliate KOMO on Saturday that they believe a bottle of vodka at the party had been spiked with a date-rape drug known as ""roofies."" They said several people at the party used vodka from the bottle to make mixed drinks. Those who brought their own alcohol, drank beer or didn't drink any alcohol were not affected, the students told KOMO. Ferguson would not comment on the type of drug placed in the beverages. He said he will ask the Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory to expedite test results. Police do not know who spiked the drinks. ""Whatever occurred up there wasn't consensual,"" Ferguson told CNN. Officers initially responded to an 11:09 p.m. call Friday about a female found unconscious in a vehicle in a grocery store parking lot, Ferguson said. Friends of the victim told authorities to go to a residence in Roslyn, according to a statement from the Cle Elum Police Department. An officer entered one room and took a man into custody who was having sex with a semi-conscious young woman, said Ferguson. Police later determined the woman was the girlfriend of the young man. She exhibited signs of having ingested a spiked drink, Ferguson said, and was taken to the hospital and later released. Her boyfriend was detained and questioned, but not booked. The investigation of that incident -- which authorities described earlier as a ""possible sexual assault"" -- continues, Ferguson said. Several others at the party appeared to be suffering from overdoses at the residence. None of the underage people who overdosed meant to get high or unconscious, said Ferguson, and none had more than one or two drinks, KOMO reported. Rather, he said, they appear to be victims of a scheme to render them unconscious and unable to resist or defend themselves. The woman found in the parking lot remained in the hospital Saturday in stable condition, police said. Twelve people, 11 of them female, initially were taken to hospitals, police said. All except one were released. The party took place at a rental home about 30 minutes from the university campus in Ellensburg, police said. The owner of the home was not at the party, police said. Police interviewed about 35 others who attended the party, which they said was organized by a Central Washington student. The university said it is ""shaken and saddened"" about the incident. ""CWU strictly enforces state law and university policy on underage drinking and illegal drug use,"" it said, adding that freshmen are educated on drug and alcohol abuse and sexual assault. ""Despite our best efforts, however, students sometimes make bad choices,"" the university said. Students identified as being involved with the party will have a conduct hearing that could result in an intensive education course, referral to counselors or suspension, it said. The school will hold information sessions Saturday and Sunday at residence halls, the statement said. Police and schools typically warn young people to be careful about ingesting beverages. ""Roofies,"" a street name for Rohypnol, is a tasteless and odorless drug, Boston University says in a fact sheet on its website, and easily dissolves in beverages. The fact sheet advises students to watch their drinks, avoid punch bowls and not to accept opened beverages.

756,"(CNN)  -- A paramedic accused of plotting to extort $25 million from actor John Travolta after his 16-year-old son died in the Bahamas told a jury Wednesday the boy had been dead for some time before the ambulance service was called. John Travolta's 16-year-old son, Jett, died in the Bahamas in January after having a seizure. Tarino Lightbourn said in his statement to the Nassau, Bahamas, jury that a doctor told medics to keep administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Jett Travolta despite knowing the teen was dead, and that the ambulance company was told to transport him to the hospital -- something not usually done if a person was already dead. Lightbourn and former Bahamian Sen. Pleasant Bridgewater are on trial on charges they attempted to extort money from Travolta after his son's January 2 death from a seizure. In Bahamian courts, defendants are allowed to make a statement without being placed under oath and will not face cross-examination. Earlier in the trial, Travolta testified that his son was found unresponsive by a nanny at the home on the island of Grand Bahama, where the family was spending the New Year's holiday. Lightbourn said Jett Travolta's veins had collapsed and his body was stiff as he lay on the bathroom floor. Someone in the room suggested that those present would receive a lot of money if they stayed quiet, he said, adding he thought this was part of a cover-up. Lightbourn did not say to whom he was referring. Travolta testified he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked and where Travolta, who is a pilot, planned to fly his son to a West Palm Beach, Florida, hospital instead of driving him to one in nearby Freeport. The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability. ""I received a liability of release document. I signed it. I did not read it. Time was of the essence,"" Travolta testified earlier in the trial. While he and his wife were riding in the ambulance with their son, they decided to divert to the hospital. At the hospital, the actor was told his son ""wasn't alive,"" he said. In her statement, Bridgewater said she advised Lightbourn not to sell the document because she was trying to protect the Travoltas and the Bahamas. She said she was concerned Travolta would tell his friends not to travel to the Bahamas because of the lack of privacy. Lightbourn said Wednesday that he asked attorney Bridgewater to assist him in negotiations with Travolta's attorneys. Travolta earlier testified he learned of a demand for $25 million, or ""stories connected to that document would be sold to the press ... The stories would imply the death of my son was intentional and I was culpable somehow."" Travolta attorney Michael McDermott testified that he assisted police in a sting by secretly recording meeting with the defendants in a Nassau hotel room. Bahamian police had placed wireless microphones on McDermott and hidden two cameras in his room, McDermott said. Lightbourn said his eyes popped when Travolta's attorney offered him $15 million for the document Travolta signed. Travolta's attorney testified the negotiations between Lightbourn and himself were all part of the Bahamian police sting. On Wednesday, Travolta attorney Michael Ossi told CNN he could not comment on specifics in the case. ""The statements made today are not evidence, but what has already been placed into evidence speaks for itself,"" he said. Defense attorneys have attempted to convince the jury that Travolta's attorney came to the Bahamas to ""set up"" their clients. Murrio Ducille, who represents Bridgewater, said to Travolta's attorney, ""you came to the island with evil in your heart."" The trial is expected to wrap up early next week when the jury will begin its deliberations. Travolta and his wife, actress Kelly Preston, are not expected back in court.

757,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A strong storm system made driving dangerous in the Rockies and the upper Plains and contributed to a pileup involving about 100 vehicles Thursday near Fargo, North Dakota, officials said. ""It is not fit for anyone to be out there,"" North Dakota State Highway Patrol Capt. Eldon Mehrer told CNN radio. Snow, ice and rain plagued much of the West, and North Dakota officials closed Interstate I-94 between Jamestown and Fargo and the north-south Interstate 29 from the Canadian border to South Dakota. The I-94 chain-reaction wreck a few miles west of Fargo occurred when two semi trucks jackknifed in the treacherous conditions, Some 100 vehicles were affected by the mishap, with about 30 involved in crashes. One person was critically injured amid four injury incidents, Mehrer said. Clearing the accident was difficult, said the patrol officer, who had a simple message to motorists: stay home. Across much of the state, rescuers gave up trying to get vehicles out of ditches and concentrated on picking up stranded motorists using snowmobiles and buses. In California, acting Gov. Abel Maldonado declared a state of emergency for Mariposa County Thursday because of extreme weather and storm conditions. The central California community becomes the 12th California county declared to be in a state of emergency because of this month's punishing rain and windstorms. The others are Kern, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Tulare, Kings, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Inyo and San Diego counties. Officials in Mariposa County, which describes itself as the home to Yosemite National Park, had earlier declared a local emergency, Maldonado said in the proclamation. This month's winter storms have been so punishing that the flood damage to homes, businesses and roads require ""the combined forces"" of state and regional aid for providing relief, the proclamation said. Maldonado is serving as the chief executive while Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is away from the state on vacation. Meanwhile, a missing snowboarder who had been enjoying the fresh snow was found dead Thursday morning in the Alpine Meadows ski resort in Tahoe City, California, said resort spokeswoman Rachael Woods. Shawnte Willis, 25, of Tahoma, California, had been missing since Tuesday when snowboarding with friends, and her body was found in a tree well about 400 feet below the Pacific Crest Trail in the Granite Chief Wilderness Area by search and rescue team supervised by the Placer County Sheriff's Department. A series of Pacific storms have created the wettest December ever throughout southern California, according to National Weather Service recording stations in Los Angeles, Long Beach, Camarillo, Santa Barbara and Santa Maria. Arizona was rebounding Thursday from the storm, with I-17 and I-40 open in both directions. Crews were using de-icers to keep them safe, officials said. ""We think we passed the worst of it,"" said Department of Transportation spokesman Timothy Tait, indicating clear skies Friday will help after a frosty overnight. iReport: Share photos, video of winter weather and traffic . Snow, ice and low visibility snarled traffic, and parked cars made it difficult for some of the nearly 300 state snowplows to do their work, Tait said. Suburbs of Phoenix reported flurries. U.S.180 remained closed north of Flagstaff, and 89A between Sedona and Flagstaff was mostly out of commission. This week's storms were also ""a contributing factor"" in the death of a 70-year-old woman in a northern California exotic wildlife preserve, authorities said Wednesday. The woman was reading a bedtime story to her 7-year-old granddaughter Tuesday night when an oak fell on their safari-style luxury tent in Santa Rosa. The grandmother was killed instantly, authorities said, but the child was unharmed. ""Obviously, the weather was a contributing factor to this tragedy,"" said Cyndi Foreman, a spokeswoman for the Rincon Valley Fire Protection District in Santa Rosa. ""It was heavy rain in a short period of time and heavy winds and back-to-back storms."" The death occurred as a strong and cold storm system from the Gulf of Alaska moved into the West. Ice was causing headaches in Arizona and the National Weather Service said additional rains, heavy snow and winds would make the going rough over the next several days for residents in much of the region. Weather specialist Stuart Seto said this week's rainstorms, pushed by a cold front out of the Gulf of Alaska, didn't produce major debris or mudslides on Tuesday or Wednesday. ""It was a fast-moving storm, so we were lucky. No major debris flows (but) there were some little ones,"" Seto said. The Alaskan front brought low temperatures to southern California Thursday and is expected to bring freezing temperatures to the Los Angeles suburb of Woodland Hills, which could see 31 degrees Friday morning, Seto said. The record low for that day was set in 1972 at 27 degrees, Seto said. In New York, snowbound residents said their streets remained clogged days after a massive holiday blizzard. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Thursday he will investigate whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed cleanup efforts over frustrations regarding citywide budget cuts. The slow cleanup effort hampered morning commuters, delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours, officials said.

758,"(CNN) -- Thirteen townships in Australia's flooded Queensland state were evacuated Thursday as forecasters warned it may be weeks before river levels start to drop. All 130 residents of Condamine, about 185 miles inland from Brisbane, were evacuated because the town was inundated with water, Queensland Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts told CNN. He said it was one of 13 townships where residents had to be moved out Thursday. In all, between 1,000 and 2,000 people have been evacuated, he said. Roberts was in Emerald, an inland city of 15,000 residents that was experiencing some of the worst flooding Thursday. The Fitzroy River there was rising and expected to peak Friday at a record level of 16.2 meters (53.2 feet), according to Jeff Perkins, a supervising hydrologist at Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. ""Emerald is downstream of Fairbairn Dam. We're expecting the dam to peak overnight tonight and Emerald to peak tomorrow,"" Perkins told CNN. Rockhampton, a coastal city of 50,000 that is also affected by the Fitzroy River, was expected to see its worst flooding in 50 years next week, Perkins said. ""It's going to be a big flood over next week, up to about 9.4 meters (30.8 feet), which will be similar to the 1954 flood,"" Perkins said. Many areas around the Fitzroy River will still be at flood stage in 10-14 days' time, he said. Elsewhere in Queensland, Australia's northeast state, it was a mixed picture. The town of Bundaberg peaked Thursday at 7.92 meters (26 feet), Perkins said. That level was expected to stay steady throughout the day but start to fall Friday, he said. Parts of northern Queensland, however, were starting to recover from the monsoon rains that started about a week ago, creating the flooding problems, Perkins said. The rainfall has since moved south, flooding southern parts of the state, including Emerald and Rockhampton. Over the entire month of December, Queensland has seen 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) of rain -- most of which fell during the past four or five days, said Tony Auden, a forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology. ""There's been numerous rainfall records both for individual days and for much of the year, and for the month as well for northern and eastern Queensland,"" Auden told CNN. The rain is now easing, but it has left behind flooded rivers that continue to cause the problems, he said. Eight areas of the state have been declared disaster situations, Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said. She said the flooding was the worst she's ever seen. ""What is unprecedented about what's happening up here at the moment is just the scale and the number of communities affected,"" she said in an interview Thursday with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""I've certainly seen flooded towns before in Queensland. We have big storms and we have big river systems. But I've never seen Queensland -- and I think it's without precedent in our recorded history -- with so many places in so many diverse parts of the state each affected so critically all at once."" The government of Queensland said additional police have been sent to many flood-affected areas including Emerald, Rockhampton and Bundaberg. It asked drivers to be careful when driving over the New Year holiday throughout the state. More than 100,000 liters (26,400 gallons) of water was being trucked into the town of flooded town of Dalby on Thursday because it was left with only two days' worth of drinking water supply, Roberts' office said. ""This is a proactive measure, initiated before the stocks were exhausted,"" Roberts said in a statement. ""The emergency was caused by the town's water treatment plant being out of action after flood inundation."" Thirty-one of Queensland's 73 communities are now receiving government disaster assistance, Prime Minister Julia Gillard's office announced this week. Acting Attorney General Brendan O'Connor said the government would continue to monitor the situation in disaster-declared areas across Australia and work with state authorities to provide more assistance.","13 townships are evacuated Thursday .

759,"(CNN) -- NASA engineers will repair small cracks found on the space shuttle Discovery's external fuel tank -- a development that could further delay its launch. ""The X-rays showed four additional small cracks on three stringers on the opposite side of the tank from Discovery, and managers elected to repair those cracks ..."" NASA said in a statement. The work is expected to take two to three days. Additional repairs may be needed, NASA said. The cracks on support beams called ""stringers"" showed up during the latest round of image scans that NASA has been conducting to determine when the shuttle can take off, the space agency said Thursday. The earliest possible launch date is February 3, according to the agency. Earlier cracks found in the foam covering the fuel tank have repeatedly delayed the shuttle's final launch, originally scheduled for November 1. Technicians repaired the cracks and reapplied foam insulation on aluminum brackets on the tank in November. The foam cracked while the tank was being filled November 5 for the shuttle's planned launch to the International Space Station. Discovery is scheduled to deliver a storage module, a science rig and spare parts to the orbiting facility. The delay means the final launch of Endeavour, which is also scheduled to be the last launch of the space shuttle program, is likely to be delayed until April 1, said Bill Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for space operations.","Cracks found in the foam covering the tank have caused delays .

760,"(CNN) -- A Texas distributor has expanded a recall already involving thousands of cases of produce over fears of salmonella cross-contamination in its processing facility, the company said. The case is one of two apparently unrelated outbreaks that have sickened nearly 100 people in the United States and Canada. J&D Produce, Inc. had previously announced the recall of nearly 7,000 cases of cilantro and curly parsley after samples in Quebec, Canada, and Michigan tested positive for the bacteria, the company said Monday. The ""precautionary, voluntary recall"" pertains to cilantro and parsley packed between November 30 and December 6, the Edinburg, Texas-based company said in a statement. The produce was processed and branded as Little Bear between those dates can be taken to retailers for a full refund. The company is also recalling 19 other types of produce that were run on the same packing lines, because the salmonella may have spread to those products as well. ""It's imperative to protect public health, even if that means being overzealous in expanding the scope of the products we're calling back,"" said James Bassetti, president of J&D Produce. ""We will work closely with regulators, health officials and our customers in bringing back the products."" No one has reported getting sick from eating the vegetables, according to J&D Produce. The recall came after independent tests found salmonella on the company's parsley in Quebec and its cilantro in Detroit, Michigan. The company's products are sold retail as well as to wholesalers, who may then distribute them to restaurants and other establishments, according to Sharon McNerney, a public relations consultant for the company. The recall involves 2,498 cases of the parsley -- which have expiration dates 12 days after being packed -- that went out to the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario and the U.S. states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The 4,411 recalled cases of cilantro, carrying the same packing and expiration dates, were distributed in Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin as well as Quebec and Ontario. A complete listing of the other recalled produce will be available on the company's website. After the positive results, regulators and health officials in the United States and Canada have stepped up inspections of J&D Produce's facilities, Bassetti said. They also undertook other measures, including stopping and sanitizing all production lines, adding manual inspections, rinsing products more and bringing in consultants. ""We have a good track record, but we'll bring our expectations and standards to even higher levels,"" he said. ""We've already begun improving our systems."" In addition to cilantro and parsley, the Texas company gathers, packs and distributes a variety of fruits and vegetables such as carrots, limes, eggplants, peppers, greens, onions, melons, mangoes and asparagus, according to its website. A separate salmonella outbreak linked to alfalfa sprouts has sickened some 94 people in 16 states and the District of Columbia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Tuesday. Health officials said those first cases became known November 1, with many getting ill after eating alfalfa sprouts in products from Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches outlets. The Food and Drug Administration said Monday that those vegetables came from Tiny Greens Organic Farm. Tiny Green's alfalfa sprouts and spicy sprouts, which have alfalfa sprouts plus radish and clover sprouts, were distributed in 4-ounce and 5-pound containers to farmers' markets, grocery stores and restaurants including Jimmy John's. In addition to a variety of sprouts, the Urbana, Illinois, produce company distributes arugula, broccoli, fennel, cauliflower, onion, radish and other items, according to its website. The FDA said consumers shouldn't eat the sprouts and restaurants shouldn't serve them. They should instead be thrown away, the agency said. In a letter to Jimmy John's franchisees, founder Jimmy John Liautaud said that the chain had pulled sprouts from all its Illinois establishments after store locations came up negative for the bacteria. About 24% of those sickened in that outbreak were hospitalized, the CDC said. No deaths have been linked to the outbreak. The FDA said Monday that the sprouts were distributed in Indiana, Iowa, Missouri and possibly other midwestern states, with roughly half the illnesses occurring in Illinois. Health officials had previously said the salmonella outbreak had sickened at least 89 people in 15 states and the District of Columbia. Salmonella is a bacterial infection that usually lasts four to seven days. About 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported each year in the United States, according to the CDC. Those who get it typically develop fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea between 12 and 72 hours after becoming infected. Most people recover on their own, without needing significant treatment. But salmonella in very young and very old people, as well as those with weakened immune systems can lead to severe illness and even death. The CDC recommends that anyone suspecting he or she may be ill from eating contaminated food should talk to a doctor.","Parsley, cilantro recalled in 14 states, two Canadian provinces .

761,"(CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor is hospitalized again and will have part of a leg amputated, according to her representative. John Blanchette said cancerous lesions started appearing on one of Gabor's legs, which were examined Sunday, and gangrene was imminent. Gabor was being prepared for surgery Sunday night. Her leg will be amputated below the knee, Blanchette said. Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, is with her in the hospital, Blanchette said. In November, Gabor was hospitalized for a swollen leg, her husband said at the time. Paramedics initially suspected Gabor suffered from a blood clot in her left leg, but an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center later determined she had an infection, according to Von Anhalt. Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt has said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge""; ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""","Zsa Zsa Gabor will have her leg amputated below the knee .

762,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia's government, already beset by a killer earthquake and tsunami, moved Wednesday to help tens of thousands of residents displaced by a volcanic eruption that also claimed 29 lives. Thirty-eight people were injured and 42,000 were evacuated around Mount Merapi on Java, according to the country's National Disaster Agency. The volcano erupted at least three times Tuesday, forcing residents to flee. Merapi, which looms on the horizon north of the major city of Yogyakarta, is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and lies in one of the world's most densely populated areas. The volcano has a summit elevation of nearly 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Because no new lava dome has formed, Merapi remains dangerous, a government assessment team leader told the official news agency Antara. Hundreds of displaced residents crammed a small government building in Yogyakarta. Many had fled with only the clothes on their backs. Slamet Riady, 64, has lived through Merapi's many eruptions. ""This was bigger than the past eruptions,"" he said. ""They rang the siren, and we had no time to bring anything. The most important thing was to save ourselves."" Nearby, volunteers led a group of young children in song and dance. Yoppy Riskiadi said many of the children are going through a stressful situation and need a sense of normalcy. ""We're here to cheer them up so they can be happy and be children,"" he said. ""It's simple. We sing, dance and act crazy. They're children and they should be carefree."" Merapi's volcanic activities have decreased significantly, Indonesian chief volcanologist Surono told CNN. ""An explosive eruption will not happen again in the near future,"" Surono said. Merapi spewed more ash this time than in previous eruptions, he said. CNN iReporter Prasakti Ramadhana told CNN the volcanic ash produced heat in the area. Ramadhana, who lives about 12 miles from Merapi, said rain Wednesday night was limiting the spread of ash. The volcano and the recent Indonesian earthquake and tsunami forced President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to cut short a visit to Vietnam, Antara reported. Medical and food donations for volcano victims were coming in, Antara said. CNN's Brian Walker and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","NEW: Volcano has not formed new lava dome .

763,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The toll from a series of explosions across Baghdad climbed to at least 64 dead and 360 wounded Wednesday, Iraq's health minister Saleh Mahdi told state television al-Iraqiya. The blasts across the capital Tuesday included 14 car bombs, two roadside bombs and mortar attacks in at least 17 neighborhoods, most of them in Shiite areas, police said. In an earlier report, police said there had been three roadside bombs and a sticky bomb: a device typically placed on a vehicle. Explosions struck the Shiite neighborhoods of Kadhimiya in the northwest; Amil, Bayaa and Shulaa in the southwest; Ur and Zuhour in the northeast; Sadr City, Kamaliya and Amin in the east; and Abu Dhsir in the southern part of the city. Other blasts struck mixed Sunni-Shiite neighborhoods, including Waziriya, Yarmouk, Jihad and Eghraiat. U.S. military advisers went to some of the explosion sites with Iraqi security forces, the military said in a statement. A U.S. military spokesman, Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, said the strikes are typical of al Qaeda in Iraq attacks. During the height of the Iraq war, sectarian violence tore through Baghdad on a daily basis in Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods. Despite a series of recent bombings, ""overall security is good"" and ""attack levels [in Iraq] remain at historically low levels,"" Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said Wednesday. On Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists protested Iraq's move -- carried out Monday -- to close Al-Baghdadiya TV's offices in Baghdad and Basra. The decision came after the Cairo, Egypt-based satellite channel broadcast demands of gunmen who attacked a church in Baghdad on Sunday. The hours-long standoff ended after Iraqi security forces stormed the Sayidat al-Nejat church. In all, 58 people died, and 75 others were wounded; most of the casualties were women and children, the officials added. The Al-Baghdadiya bureau chief in Cairo, Abdelhamid al-Saih, told the journalists group that the shutdown was illegal since there was no judicial order and that he believed authorities were using the broadcast as a pretext to close the offices because the channel had previously given Iraqis the opportunity to criticize the government. ""We are concerned by the closure of Al-Baghdadiya TV and demand that [the government's Communications and Media Commission] explain under what authority it has stormed the station's offices and censored it,"" said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""We call on the authorities to allow the station to resume its operations immediately."" According to the committee, the government commission said in a statement that the attackers had ""contacted the station and selected it to be the exclusive platform for their inhumane practices with the purpose of disrupting Iraq's national unity and to inflame religious discord."" It said, ""the station's broadcast of demands 'amounts to incitement to violence' and that Al-Baghdadia's coverage was not objective, creating a threat to the military operation by providing attackers with information about ongoing operations to rescue the hostages.""

764,"(CNN) -- The family of the U.S. swim star who died over the weekend during a race in the United Arab Emirates mourned Monday as answers to questions surrounding his death remained murky. Fran Crippen, 26, died Saturday during the last leg of the Marathon Swimming World Cup. ""The official word coming out of the UAE ... is that he died from drowning. So now we have to go and figure out exactly how that happened because obviously Fran was a swimmer who was in peak physical shape,"" the swimmer's sister, Maddy Crippen, told CNN. Another athlete in the race told CNN the competition might not have been monitored closely enough. ""I may be mistaken, but I can't remember seeing any boats that were going by us to watch the athletes a little bit closer, especially the ones that were falling behind,"" said German swimmer Jan Wolfgarten. ""With the conditions that extreme, for future reference, there should be people watching what's going on with the athletes,"" Wolfgarten said. Monitors on at least nine boats and four personal watercraft were watching the race, according to event organizers. Wolfgarten said he thought Crippen ""was in just as good a shape as anyone can be."" But both the water and the air were ""really, really warm,"" Wolfgarten told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""The sun came straight down"" during the last lap, just before noon, he said, suggesting it might be better to do the race in late afternoon next year. Crippen's sister said she had heard from people who were there that her brother wasn't ""charging"" like he usually did when he swam. ""He wasn't himself as the race continued,"" she said. U.S. Swimming Federation authorities said they expect to receive the body of the star open-water swimmer Monday. ""In respect for his memory,"" the International Swimming Federation (FINA) canceled the remaining heats in the UAE in the wake of Crippen's death, according the federation's website. The loss of Crippen hit hard in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he grew up in a family of swimmers. Crippen was on target to achieve his goal of being an Olympian -- a dream cut short. ""We're all grieving. We're all in shock,"" said Richard Shoulberg, his longtime prep school coach. Doctors determined that severe fatigue was behind Crippen's sudden death, UAE Swimming Federation Secretary Saeed Al Hamour told CNN on Sunday. Earlier, however, the head of the water sports club in Fujairah, Ahmed Ibrahim, said that preliminary tests showed the swimmer suffered a heart attack. The official report released by the UAE Swimming Federation made no mention of a heart attack. Crippen died during the last leg of the Marathon Swimming World Cup in Fujairah, the International Swimming Federation said in a news release. The cause of death is under investigation, the federation said. In a conversation with Shoulberg 12 hours before the race, Crippen said that the outside temperature was 100 degrees and that the water was 87 degrees. Some have speculated the high temperatures may have contributed to the death. However, Al Hamour denied any reports that Crippen's death may have been caused by water temperature. ""The competition was monitored and supervised by the International Swimming Federation. All security measures were taken care of as needed,"" Al Hamour said. ""We've organized so far 14 competitions and championships and never had any death."" Swimming World magazine reported that Crippen fell unconscious during the event and deep-sea divers found him two hours later near the race's final buoy. Crippen won bronze in the 10-kilometer event at the 2009 FINA World Championships and was the gold medalist in the same event at the 2007 Pan American Games, according to USA Swimming. Monday, his family released a statement thanking Crippen's fans and friends for their support. ""Fran's life was filled with passion, whether it was swimming for the U.S. or cheering on his beloved Philadelphia Phillies. We take some solace knowing he passed while doing what he loved most, swimming,"" it read.","NEW: Swimmer's family takse solace in knowing ""he passed ... doing what he loved""

765,"Guatemala City, Guatemala (CNN) -- Six people were killed and 17 were injured in a bomb blast onboard a bus in northwestern Guatemala City, officials said. Police on Tuesday were still not sure who set off the bomb or why, though one transportation union leader said that gang members had threatened violence if bus companies did not pay extortions. Initial reports from police on Monday were of four or five people dead, but the number rose to six Tuesday morning, CNN affiliate Noti 7 reported. The injured remained at the hospital, where they were being treated for second- and third-degree burns. A mother and her two children of 11 and 13 years were among those killed, local media reported. Some witnesses told police that a woman came aboard the bus, placed the bag that presumably held the explosive on the luggage rack, and then got off the bus, Noti 7 reported. But authorities added that they are investigating all possibilities. Gamaliel Chan of the bus drivers' union said that his organization had warned authorities of the possibility of an attack because of threats made to them by gang members.

766,"(CNN) -- A 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck the central coastal area of Chile on Sunday, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) northwest of Temuco, the U.S. Geological Survey said. There were no immediate reports of major damage or injury. The quake, which stuck around 5:20 p.m. (3:20 p.m. ET), was felt as far away as Santiago, roughly 595 km (370 miles) north of where the USGS said the quake occurred. The epicenter was more than 10 miles underground, the USGS said. Loreto Henriquez, manager of the Holiday Inn Express in Temuco, felt the quake for about a minute, describing it as loud and strong. She said people ran into the streets, but did not report any major damage. CNN Chile similarly reported no immediate injuries or damage. The temblor cut some telephone and electricity lines, according to Chile's national emergency office, which did not provide any further detail. Roughly 91,000 people felt very strong shaking, according to USGS estimates. Soon after the quake, a 5.0-magnitude aftershock rattled the area around 6:10 p.m. (4:10 p.m. ET), striking some 110 km (70 miles) northwest of Temuco. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said no widespread tsunami threat exists, but did not rule out the possibility of local tsunamis close to the quake's epicenter. In February, an 8.8-magnitude quake hit Chile near the nation's second largest city, Concepcion, killing hundreds. Sunday's quake struck roughly 100 miles south of Concepcion.

767,"(CNN) -- Ten people were killed and 18 injured in clashes between ""criminal gangs"" in a southwestern Mexican town, Mexico's federal government said Saturday. Mexico's interior ministry issued a statement blasting what it called ""reprehensible acts"" that it said contributed to the deaths, which occurred Friday night in Tecalitlan in the state of Jalisco. Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora contacted Jalisco Gov. Emilio Gonzalez Marquez to offer the federal government's help in improving safety and security in the town, the statement said. Federal authorities also offered help tracking down ""the criminals responsible."" The violence came one day after federal troops gunned down an alleged drug cartel boss in the state of Michoacan, which neighbors Jalisco. The death of Nazario Moreno Gonzalez and two other Familia Michoacana members came during a joint operation involving members of Mexico's federal police, army, air force and navy. At least five federal police officers and three civilians died in that operation, officials said Friday afternoon.","10 people died in gang violence Friday, Mexico's federal government says .

768,"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli authorities are investigating whether the attack that left an American woman dead and her friend injured was ""nationalistic,"" a police spokesman said Monday, using a term for crimes in which a victim is targeted based on an Arab or Israeli background. American Kristine Luken died in the attack. Her body was found Sunday after Kay Susan Wilson, Luken's friend and co-worker at a Christian ministry, stumbled into a picnic area with her hands bound, bleeding from multiple stab wounds and asking for help. Wilson told authorities the two were hiking in a forest near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem, when two men attacked them, tied them to a tree and stabbed them, according to police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. Wilson told reporters from her hospital bed Sunday that one of the men was armed with a long serated knife and that she believes they were Arab. ""It was clear that they came to kill,"" the Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted Wilson as saying. ""Who carries around a knife like that?"" Wilson said she was wearing a Star of David on a necklace when she was attacked, according to the newspaper. ""He took it off like a gentleman and then turned me around and stabbed in the place where the Star of David had been,"" Haaretz quoted her as saying. Rosenfeld confirmed Monday that investigators' primary focus is that the attacks may have involved nationalistic intent, but he said investigators have not yet completely ruled out other possibilities. Luken and Wilson both worked for CMJ UK, a Christian ministry based in England. Wilson, a British citizen living in Israel, was a senior tour guide for the group, according to a statement posted to the group's website by its CEO, Robin Aldridge . Luken was an administrator for the group and had recently taken over responsibility for managing the group's tour operations in Israel, Aldridge said. ""She had a beautiful and gentle spirit as well as a strong and vibrant faith,"" Aldridge said of Luken. ""She loved Israel and had visited on several occasions both as a tourist and as a member of CMJ."" ""It is a tragedy that such a lively, caring and faith-filled person should have been struck down in such a way,"" he said. The Foreign Office in London said it was ""aware of the hospitalization of a British national"" and was ready to provide assistance if needed. Luken had worked for CMJ UK for one year, having previously been a government employee, according to Aldridge. ""She had to cope with a move to a new country as well as a new job but quickly made the adjustment and became a key member of our team,"" Aldridge said. He said the group's work sharing the Christian faith with the Jewish people in Israel would continue despite the attack.","NEW: Police confirm they are focusing on whether the attack was ""nationalistic""

769,"(CNN) -- A blast of harsh winter weather socked Europe Friday, causing travel chaos and sending temperatures into the deep-freeze. From Northern Ireland to Bulgaria, blizzard conditions left airports with heavy delays or shut them entirely. In Belgium, truck drivers were forced to spend a freezing night in their cabs when authorities banned trucks over seven tons from travelling on icy roads. At London's Heathrow Airport, snow caused the cancellation of many short-haul flights. These cancellations sparked a domino-effect that left passenger aircraft unable to get to the gates, prompting further delays. Hundreds of passengers who did manage to land were still unable to claim their luggage after baggage-handlers ended their shifts. Meteorologists say the cold weather is caused by a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation, which means that cold Arctic air is flowing into southern latitudes that are normally much warmer. Forecasters don't expect conditions to change anytime soon. The next wave of snowy weather is expected to bring up to 20 centimeters to some parts of the U.K., with London expected to receive 5-10 centimeters of snow. The weather system will move across France and Germany on Saturday night and Sunday. Below-normal temperatures are expected to continue in northern Europe into the beginning of next week.","Travel chaos reigns across northern Europe amid harsh winter weather .

770,"New York (CNN) -- A propane gas tank leak that prompted the evacuations of an estimated 900 homes in Shirley, New York, was contained, officials said Saturday night. After conducting an air quality sampling of 100 residences, officials decided to allow all residents to go home, said Suffolk County spokesman Dan Aug. Electricity was restored, with the exception of a shopping center that holds the 30,000-gallon underground storage tank. Fire and other workers were able to close a leaking valve on the tank in the Long Island town, Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy said in a statement. The leak was discovered at 1:15 a.m. by a driver of a propane delivery truck, the county said. Red Cross spokesman Craig Cooper arrived at a local high school about 3 a.m. Saturday to help some of the evacuees, many of whom were without important medications. ""People literally showed up in their pajamas,"" he said, estimating that about 150 residents had registered at the school. The leak affected a five-mile radius around Shirley on Long Island's southern shore, according to Sgt. Greg Heller of the Suffolk County Police Department. Heller told CNN that the leak was not suspicious, but because propane gas stays low and close to the ground, authorities decided to evacuate nearby homes. The leak also shut down rail service between Patchogue and Speonk, according to Long Island Rail Road spokesman Mike Lewi. ""I commend our county, town, American Red Cross and volunteer emergency services personnel for this tightly coordinated response,"" said Levy.

771,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor's doctors took ""one last shot"" at saving the ailing actress' leg with powerful antibiotics her publicist said Monday afternoon. If the newest treatment at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center does not heal a ""very deep"" lesion in her lower leg, it will be amputated below the knee, according to spokesman John Blanchette. ""She has to be on very strong antibiotics for the next few days and then they will decide what kind of operation to go ahead with,"" Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, told HLN's ""The Joy Behar Show"" Monday. Gabor, whose 94th birthday is next month, has not been told that amputation is a possibility, Von Anhalt said. ""I'm not going to tell my wife that she probably could lose her leg,"" he said. ""She's going to get a heart attack."" Doctors recommended that Gabor check into the hospital before Christmas, he said, but she didn't want to go. ""She was crying and begged me 'Please don't bring me to the hospital over the holidays,'"" he said. Her condition worsened in recent days as gangrene set in, he said. ""It smells already bad,"" In November, Gabor was hospitalized for a swollen leg, her husband said at the time. Paramedics initially suspected Gabor suffered from a blood clot in her left leg, but an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center later determined she had an infection, according to Von Anhalt. Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt has said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge;"" ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""

772,"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Heavy flooding has left at least 50 people dead and hundreds homeless in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province as residents continue to battle adverse weather conditions that have plagued the country since mid-December, authorities said Friday. ""We have requested the national government to declare the Eastern Cape a national disaster,"" said Provincial Minister of Social Services Pemmy Majodina. ""We are going to need billions of Rands to help residents reconstruct their homes and repair the damage caused by the floods."" Dozens were killed as homes and buildings collapsed around them as a result of the flooding, which washed away bridges and destroyed roads, she said. Authorities continue to search for at least two flood victims, Majodina said. Many rural residents in the Eastern Cape live in mud hits that are unable to withstand heavy flooding. Eighteen others have died during recent electrical storms, Majodina added. In the neighboring province of KwaZulu Natal, at least 13 people have been killed by flooding and storms.","Adverse weather has plagued the country since mid-December .

773,"(CNN) -- Don't underestimate the power of a spilled cup of coffee. A United Airlines flight from Chicago to Frankfurt, Germany, was diverted to Toronto this week after the pilot dumped a cup of coffee on the plane's communication's equipment. The unwanted liquid triggered a series of emergency codes, including one for a hijacking, according to Transport Canada, the agency that regulates transportation in Canada. ""With the help of their company dispatch staff, the flight crew was confirmed the problem to be a NAV(navigation)/communication issue and not a valid code 7500 (for a hijacking or unlawful interference),"" Transport Canada said on its website. Flight 940 initially was going to return to Chicago, but then diverted to Pearson International Airport in Toronto where it landed without incident around 10 p.m. Monday. United had little to say about the coffee spill that led to the diversion, and did not acknowledge that the caffeinated beverage had anything to do with it. ""Our review of the communications issue encountered on flight 940 continues, so it's too soon to comment on any particulars that led to the captain's decision to divert,"" United spokesman Rahsaan Johnson said late Tuesday. ""But important to note the crew did maintain contact with controllers, and the decision to divert to Toronto was the captain's."" The Boeing 777 had 255 passengers and crew aboard. United retrieved them from Toronto and took them back to Chicago where they were put on another plane to Frankfurt Tuesday afternoon.","The coffee triggered emergency codes, including one for a hijacking .

774,"New York (CNN) -- Officials in New York said Tuesday they are looking into what happened to cleanup efforts during last week's monster blizzard. The New York City Department of Sanitation has drawn sharp criticism since the storm that blanketed much of the Northeast. Workers there have been accused of deliberately slowing down the response in retaliation for the city's belt-tightening measures. New York City Councilman Dan Halloran said three sanitation workers and two Department of Transportation supervisors came to his office saying their bosses ordered the slowdown, telling workers that ""the mayor will see how much he needs us"" and ""there will be plenty of overtime."" ""This office is reviewing information provided to it by City Councilman Dan Halloran, among others, with respect to last week's snowstorm and the City's response thereto. In addition, we have been in contact with the City's Department of Investigation,"" Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said in a statement. He added that his office has not yet reached a decision as to whether a formal investigation is warranted. Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty has said he had not seen evidence of a worker protest. Similarly, the head of New York's sanitation workers union, Harry Nespoli, has said he was not aware of any slowdown and doubted there was a protest by workers. Department of Investigation Commissioner Rose Gill Hearn said her office was looking into reports of wrongdoing and asked anyone with information to step forward. ""DOI is continuing its multi-borough investigation into whether there is any evidence of intentional acts of commission or omission related to the snow clean up and has been conducting its investigation since last week,"" the department said in a statement Tuesday. ""As we always do, we will provide our factual findings when we have concluded. In addition, we have heard from various prosecutors' offices and if we find a violation of state or federal law will work closely with the appropriate agency,"" it continued. Authorities in Brooklyn also said they would review what happened with respect to snow removal last week. Robert Nardoza, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office Eastern District of New York, declined to say if officials there would pursue a criminal investigation related to the response.

775,"(CNN) -- A 10-year-old Ohio boy was taken into custody after police suspected that he shot and killed his mother with .22-caliber rifle, police said. The body of Deborah L. McVay, 46, was found on Sunday lying face down on her living room floor in Holmesville, Ohio, some 75 miles south of Cleveland, according to Holmes County Sheriff Tim Zimmerly. McVay was apparently killed by a single gunshot wound to the head, Zimmerly said in a statement on Monday. She was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency personnel. McVay's son was later brought into custody after he allegedly asked a neighbor for help, telling the neighbor that he had just shot his mother, the statement said. Defense attorney Andrew Hyde said he entered a denial that the boy purposely killed his mother, allowing him time to investigate the incident. ""He is very emotional at this time,"" Hyde said. ""I think he is still struggling to accept that this happened and his mother died.""

777,"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- Baltimore Orioles pitcher Alfredo Simon said Monday the shooting death of a 25-year-old man over the weekend was an accident. ""In truth that young man was my friend, like a brother,"" he said of Michael Esteban Castillo.  ""It wasn't a thing like we began arguing and I started shooting.  It was some accident; it happened by accident,"" Simon said, speaking at the police station where he turned himself in.  ""That's why I came here -- to open my soul,"" he said. Simon surrendered to Dominican National Police early Monday morning to face murder charges.  Simon is also accused of wounding Castillo's 17-year-old brother, Starlin. The injuries to the brother are not life-threatening, police said. Simon's attorney said the major league baseball player had fired his gun into the air. Puerto Plata District Attorney Victor Mieses said Monday that he will seek three months of incarceration against Simon and widen the investigation. Puerto Plata Assistant District Attorney Juan Carlos Hernandez, who is handling the case, said of Simon, ""So far he's the one.  There's no doubt about the incident.""  Hernandez added that it's ""normal"" to seek temporary incarceration when there's a shooting death. Police spokesman Maximo Baez said Simon turned in his gun as part of the investigation into the shooting in the Los Salados section of the town of Luperon, in the province of Puerto Plata, early Saturday. Simon was accompanied by his attorney, Carlos Olivares, and by fellow Oriole Julio Lugo, Baez said. ""The projectile's trajectory was only up into the air, so much so that he left,"" Olivares said of his client.  ""He understood that nothing had happened at the moment.  And 45 minutes later, when he was eating at a some restaurant or discotheque, somebody tells him, 'Hey, you're the one who killed so-and-so.'"" Lugo said, ""We're concerned about his career or whether he's going to have to go to jail.  We don't know if it was him.  He wants to clear up what happened, but no one really knows if it was him for sure."" Simon was scheduled to appear at the courthouse in Puerto Plata for arraignment Monday, Baez said. Simon, 29, hails from Santiago. He joined the Orioles in 2008. The Baltimore Orioles declined comment.

778,"(CNN) -- A driver's best bet is to stay home when wintry weather coats the roads in snow and ice, particularly in areas such as the Southeast where motorists and road crews aren't in the habit of dealing with icy conditions. The Georgia Department of Transportation is urging travelers to avoid all but absolutely necessary driving until at least Tuesday as a storm that arrived Sunday night continues to cause treacherous traveling. For those who must go out, it's important to plan ahead. AAA recommends motorists pack a winter driving kit made up of the following: a bag of abrasive material (sand, salt or cat litter), a snow shovel and brush, traction mats, an ice scraper, booster cables, a flashlight, window washing liquid, cloth, warning flares or triangles, a cell phone, gloves and a blanket. Try to ease your vehicle out of parking spaces without spinning the wheels. Drive back and forth for several feet in either direction to clear a path. Spread sand or salt near the wheels if additional traction is needed. If you do get stuck, you can contact AAA via phone, iPhone app or at AAA.com. De-ice vehicles before driving, urges the Mississippi Department of Transportation. Iced-over vehicles can limit driver visibility, and ice flying off cars can be hazardous to fellow drivers. If you have to drive in conditions with low visibility, go slowly, with your headlights on low beam, AAA advises. Allow at least double the usual following distance between cars. Never use cruise control on a slick surface. Steering around an obstruction is often safer than braking suddenly at speeds above 25 mph on a slippery surface, according to AAA's pamphlet ""How to Go on Ice and Snow"" (PDF). When you do brake, don't remove your foot from the brake or pump the pedal if you have antilock brakes, AAA advises. Drivers of cars that don't have antilock brakes should keep their heel on the floor and apply firm pressure to the brake pedal to the threshold of locking. In case of skidding, steer in the direction you want the front of the car to go, keeping your eyes on your travel path. And don't slam on the brakes; you're likely to make it harder to get back in control.","Georgia officials urging drivers to avoid travel until at least Tuesday .

779,"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Nineteen demonstrators protesting high unemployment and poor living conditions have been killed during the past two days in riots that broke out in two Tunisian cities near its border with Algeria, a government official said Monday. The incidents occurred in the cities of Thala and Kasserine, said Minister of Information Samir Abidi. All of the dead were demonstrators; more than 30 police were injured, he said. Amnesty International said at least 23 people died in protests over the weekend, and it had received reports of more deaths on Monday. Citing ""information gathered by Amnesty International,"" it said security forces fired tear gas and live ammunition to disperse demonstrators in the cities of Thala, Kasserine and Regueb in central Tunisia. ""The authorities must urgently ensure the safety of protesters and instruct security forces to act with restraint and not to use excessive force against them,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa deputy director. ""The authorities claim they acted in self-defense but the rising death toll and the images of demonstrations suppressed by the security forces cast serious doubt on this version of events,"" Hassiba said. In Kasserine alone, 13 people were killed in two days, Amnesty International said. The organization called for an investigation into the deaths and for those responsible to be punished. Major cities were unaffected by the unrest. The demonstrations included demands for the government to improve social services. Tunisia's government called the protesters violent troublemakers. Tunisia has been ruled for 23 years by President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, an ally of Western powers and a target of activist and human rights groups that accuse him of running a corrupt police state that has infringed on citizens' rights. In his second speech since the riots erupted, he said on national radio and television that he was ordering the creation of as many as 300,000 jobs and called for greater freedoms for members of the news media. ""These violent, sometimes bloody events, which caused deaths among civilians and injuries among security officers, were perpetrated by hooded gangs that attacked, at night, public institutions and even citizens in their houses,"" he said. ""This is an intolerable act of terrorism."" He said he would lower taxes on employers who generate new jobs. Tunisia's 14% unemployment rate does not reflect the true problems faced by the nation, Abidi said. The government pays for college educations, but only about a third of the 80,000 students who graduate each year from the nation's universities are able to find work, he said. As a result, he said, unemployment among college graduates hovers around 25%. Abidi said the government does not oppose the right of demonstrators to express their opinions, but it will not tolerate violence. He said extremist groups like al Qaeda might use the riots to recruit young people. Human rights groups have said the Tunisian government has cracked down on demonstrators with force. Reporters Without Borders condemned the arrests and disappearances of bloggers and online activists across a number of Tunisian cities. The worldwide press freedom organization said police arrested the bloggers to question them about hacking into government websites. The wave of demonstrations was sparked by the suicide of an unemployed college graduate in early December. Mohamed Bouazizi, 26, set himself on fire in front of a government building in the town of Sidi Bouzid in early December after police confiscated his fruit cart, saying he was selling without a permit, according to Amnesty International. He died from his injuries. The official news agency reported that the Tunisian government called in U.S. Ambassador Gordon Grey to answer questions about U.S. government criticism of the Tunisian government's handling of the unrest. In Washington, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley confirmed that Grey was called to hear complaints about U.S. characterization of the situation in Tunis. ""We again affirmed our concerns not only about the ongoing violence, the importance of respecting freedom of expression but also the importance of the availability of information, and we will continue that discussion,"" Crowley said. ""We understand the government has a very legitimate right to ensure the safety of its citizens. That  said, we do have concerns about some of the steps that the government has taken."" Amnesty International has urged the Tunisian government to respect freedom of expression. ""Tunisians must be allowed to express their grievances and freely protest,"" said a statement from the organization. ""The authorities made empty promises of work opportunities which were followed by a crackdown on protesters."" Tunisian authorities have said they are acting in self-defense. Security forces fired on protesters in December, the state-run TAP news agency reported at the time. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for restraint ""and urges all parties to seek to resolve differences through dialogue,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.

780,"(CNN) -- The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome will shutter its doors through at least the first quarter of 2011, the commission that runs the facility said Wednesday. ""The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission informed the organizers of every scheduled event through the month of March that the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome will not be available,"" Bill Lester, executive director of the MSFC, said in a statement. ""It has become increasingly clear that any repair or replacement scenario for the damaged roof will require at least through the month of March to be completed."" Heavy snow that hit the Midwest earlier in December caused a stunning collapse in the roof of the Metrodome.

781,"ANTALYA, Turkey (CNN) -- Two men who hijacked a Turkish passenger jet have surrendered to authorities after releasing the remaining passengers and crew they had been holding hostage. The passenger jet was en route from Northern Cyprus to Istanbul. The hijacking occurred earlier on Saturday when the Istanbul-bound Atlasjet Airlines flight from Cyprus was forced to make an emergency landing in southeastern Turkish city of Antalya after the hijackers claimed to have a bomb. Most of those aboard had managed to escape soon after landing, but four passengers and two crew members had been held as hostages, local government officials said. ""The adventure that started early in the morning finally came to an end,"" Atlasjet CEO Tuncay Doganer told reporters. ""With the two hijackers having surrendered, the incident ended with no bloodshed."" The other 132 passengers and four crew members had fled to safety from the plane's emergency exits as the hijackers were releasing children and women. TV footage showed passengers running from the plane's side and back doors. The Turkish Ministry of Transportation said the pilots escaped through the cockpit windows. Turkish Interior Minister Osman Gunes said one of the hijackers was Turkish while the other had a Syrian passport but may have been Palestinian, Reuters reported. A civil aviation official said it was unclear whether the hijackers did have a bomb but that they appeared to have been armed with a knife. Witnesses said the incident started shortly after the flight had taken off from Ercan airport in Turkish-recognized Northern Cyprus when two men from the back of the plane rushed to the front and tried to break open the cockpit door. When their attempts failed, witnesses said the men began talking to the flight attendants in a mix of Arabic and English and asked to be taken to either Iran or Syria. Passenger Ercan Tekkan told Reuters the hijackers had said they did not want to hurt anyone. ""The plane made some maneuvers and we thought the plane was going to crash ... Then the plane landed and the pilots escaped from the cockpit while the hijackers kept kicking the cockpit door,"" he said. Barkin Inan, another passenger, said the experience had been ""terrifying."" ""They looked anxious and were sweating. They went towards the cockpit. I shouted 'hijackers' to warn the other passengers but most of them were asleep,"" he said. Antalya Governor Alaaddin Yuksel told reporters that one of the men had claimed to be a member of al Qaeda, Reuters reported. Police also arrested a passenger suspected of being linked to the hijackers, he said. E-mail to a friend .

782,"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The death toll from a plane crash in northwestern Iran has risen to 77, news agencies in the country reported Monday. Twenty-seven others were injured when the IranAir jet crashed near the city of Orumiyeh, in a snowy and mountainous part of the country, state-run Press TV reported. Bad weather forced the Boeing 727 to give up its first landing attempt. It was circling for a second approach when air-traffic controllers lost contact with the plane, according to an account on Press TV. Investigators have recovered the flight data recorders and plan to analyze them to determine what caused the crash, the news agency said, citing Ahmad Majidi, deputy for crisis management in the Road and Transportation Ministry. The semi-official Fars news agency said the plane went down in farmland after making a second attempt to land. Official Iranian news agencies reported Sunday that the plane carried 105 passengers and crew members, but Press TV reported a toll Monday -- 77 dead and 27 injured -- that suggests 104 passengers and crew were on board. The discrepancy could not immediately be clarified.

784,"(CNN) -- The oldest daughter of the Austrian family portrayed in the 1965 film ""The Sound of Music"" died of heart failure Tuesday, a friend confirmed. Agathe von Trapp, 97, was in a Gilchrist Hospice in Towson, Maryland, when she died, her friend Mary Louise Kane told CNN Thursday. She fell ill November 9 and was moved on December 2 to the Gilchrist Hospice, said Kane, who ran a kindergarten with von Trapp in Glyndon, Maryland. The 16-year-old Liesl von Trapp character in the movie was based on Agathe, but the writer and director took great artistic license with the portrayal, Kane said. ""(Von Trapp) was nothing at all like the Liesl character,"" Kane said. ""She was a very private person and a bit shy. She didn't like being in the limelight at all."" Contrary to the movie, she was not the oldest of the von Trapp family. An older brother was made younger in the script. ""Liesl was a made-up character,"" Kane said. ""I never thought of her being Agathe because they were too unlike."" Four siblings survive, including Maria, 96, who lives in Vermont, Kane said. Three half-siblings still alive are Rosemarie, Eleonore, and Johannes, she said. The von Trapp family fled Austria in 1938 to escape Nazi persecution. They toured the United States as the Trapp Family Singers after World War II. Agathe von Trapp wrote her life story in a book published in 2003 and republished last September, Kane said. ""She was hoping to do some book signings,"" Kane said. ""She did enjoy the book signings because people would come and tell her how much they enjoyed her concerts."" Kane is hoping to hold a memorial service for her friend on March 12, which would have been Agathe von Trapp's 98th birthday.","Agathe von Trapp was oldest daughter of family portrayed in the ""The Sound of Music""

785,"(CNN) -- A gap in communication between the National Weather Service and the Army Corps of Engineers undercut forecasts of the deadly flood that struck middle Tennessee in 2010, the National Weather Service reported Wednesday. The Corps of Engineers was forced to increase the flow of water from a dam on the Cumberland River amid record rainfalls over Nashville and the surrounding region on May 2, according to a newly released National Weather Service review of the disaster. But forecasters weren't told about the additional releases, and the Cumberland passed its predicted crest of 41.9 feet within two hours of their advisory, the report states. ""If they had been able to provide that data back to the Weather Service, we could have had a better chance of producing a more accurate and timely forecast for the Cumberland River,"" said Weather Service meteorologist Jane Hollingsworth, the report's author. ""But again, because of the rapid evolution of the event, we could not create that communication exchange."" The Cumberland eventually crested at nearly 52 feet in downtown Nashville, nearly 12 feet over flood stage. The resulting flooding killed 11 people in the city and inflicted more than $2 billion in damages, with another 15 people killed in the surrounding region. Both Hollingsworth and Jack Hayes, the Weather Service's director, emphasized that the communication breakdown occurred during an ""unprecedented"" situation, when two-day rainfall totals more than doubled their previous record. The Corps had to increase water flows at the Old Hickory Dam in Hendersonville ""to protect the structural integrity of this dam,"" Hollingsworth told reporters. In its own November assessment, the Corps of Engineers acknowledged that ""misunderstandings"" between its Nashville district office and the Weather Service threw off forecasts ""to some degree."" Lt. Col. Anthony Mitchell, the district commander, told CNN that the Weather Service's report was ""pretty fair"" and consistent with the Corps' own report. ""Obviously, our normal protocols in how we would communicate were taxed, and they were taxed to a degree that we recognize that we need to improve upon,"" Mitchell said. But, he added, ""Our actions and the actions of those Corps employees that were out there on the spillway gates, making adjustments, saved those projects and saved lives as well."" The Corps is working on ways to share real-time data with forecasters and other agencies that need it, he said. Hollingsworth said that while the Weather Service issued flood warnings, many residents of the affected areas said they could not relate those warnings to the impact on their neighborhoods. As a result, she said, ""All perceived that they had no warning."" Hayes said the Weather Service, the Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Geological Survey have taken steps to improve communication and to learn more about each others' operations in the wake of the event. And he said the service has developed forecast maps that relate predicted crests to maps, allowing residents to see a clearer picture of how far floodwaters will reach. ""They need to know, when the river reaches 48 feet, what that will mean for their homes and businesses,"" Hollingsworth said. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Forecasters didn't know about increased releases from a dam upstream, the report finds .

786,"(CNN) -- The Christmas Eve attacks in the volatile Nigerian city of Jos have claimed at least 31 lives, a bloody aftermath in a region long torn by Christian and Muslim hostility. Gyang Choji, a special adviser to the governor of the west African country's Plateau state, confirmed the death toll on Saturday, and said 74 others were wounded. Most of the injured have serious wounds, and some of them suffered leg amputations. Seven blasts rippled through the city as residents celebrated Chrismas Eve, four in the Kabong area and three in Angwa Rubuka. Choji cited a ""lapse in security"" by a special task force not ""doing what they were expected to do."" ""Five different bombs blasts in the heart of Jos. This is the height of insecurity in this city,"" Choji said. Most of the injured have serious wounds; some of them got both legs amputated and the authorities are concerned about their conditions. Choji said no one has claimed responsibility but Islamic fundamentalists are suspected of carrying out the attacks. ""For long, they have been threatening to use violence against Christians and free the region from the shackles of Western imperialism,"" Choji said. The Jos region lies on a faith-based fault line between Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria and the mainly Christian south. On March 7, at least 200 Christians villagers were massacred near Jos, and more than 150 Muslims were killed in an attack in a nearby town, Kuru Karama, on January 19. Hassan John, a Jos resident and journalist with the media department of the Anglican Diocese of Jos, described a scene of chaos in what was expected to be a joyous Christmas Eve. He had just come out of church about 7 p.m., when he heard the sound of the first explosion. He rushed to the site, which he described as a beer parlor frequented by locals. ""By the time I got there, there were women crying, people screaming. It was all chaos, people were screaming, blood everywhere."" ""I counted eight corpses all over, seven in the building,"" John said. A second blast went off within a couple of minutes after the first one. John said residents, especially young men, became agitated over the lack of security in what has been a volatile area. ""Soldiers fired a couple of rounds into the air because a riot was developing,"" John said. Choji, who is special adviser on religious affairs to the governor, said it was unclear who set off the blasts or whether they were related. But the bombs detonated in the ""same manner,"" Choji said, and they ""all went to where people were concentrated."" In recent weeks, the governor's office had received letters purported to be from some Muslim organizations threatening attacks against Christians, Choji said. ""The security officials didn't take the threat letters seriously. They were thought of as gimmicks, and at the end of the day, they became reality."" A special task force sent to Plateau state by the federal government in the preceding two days had gone on radio telling residents to go about their business and not to worry about the security situation in the area, Choji said. The government had increased security and checkpoints throughout the past week, including additional patrols in various areas of Jos, Choji said. In Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, more than 13,500 people have died in religious or ethnic clashes since the end of military rule in 1999, the Human Rights Watch said in a report earlier this year. There have been other deadly sectarian clashes in Nigeria over the years, including one outbreak in Jos in September 2001 that left about 1,000 dead, the Human Rights Watch said.

787,"Sydney (CNN) -- Vast flooding covering much of eastern Australia could remain for weeks, as more than 1,200 residents remain out of deluged homes Wednesday. As of late Wednesday night, the Fitzroy River was hovering around 9.2 meters (30 feet), CNN meteorologist Jennifer Delgado said. ""The river has crested, it appears, and it looks like it is going to be slowly falling as we go through the next several days,"" Delgado said. Are you there? Send us your video and photos via iReport . By next week, floodwaters could remain at levels of about 8.5 meters (28 feet), Delgado said, but flooding could still affect the region for ""several weeks."" The seasonal flooding in the state of Queensland intensified last month after monsoon rains caused rivers to spill over their banks and reach record levels. The floodwaters cover an area the size of France and Germany combined and now stretch into the state of New South Wales. Images from CNN affiliate Seven Network Australia showed residents traveling down the streets in boats. From the sky, the tops of houses and trees poked out from seas of murky brown water. Snakes whipped about from under the water's surface. Flooding fueled by cyclone, La Nina . Neil Roberts, Queensland minister for police, corrective services and emergency services, said Wednesday that 1,200 to 1,500 people had to be evacuated in parts of Queensland. Roberts said some residents probably can't return to their homes for at least another week. He said the recovery could take ""many months, and potentially over a year."" Roberts said the government had an emergency cabinet meeting Wednesday and appointed a major general to lead a recovery task force. The flooding has affected the global transport of commodities such as coal and steel, as rail lines used to move such goods out of Queensland have been destroyed. Forecasters predict even more rain in the coming days. Delgado said 20 centimeters (8 inches) could fall through Thursday. On Tuesday, relief teams continued rushing supplies into the eastern city of Rockhampton. In some of the state's more rural areas, farmers said they were scrambling to send tons of crops out before waters damaged them and flooding made their transport impossible. Police said 10 people have died as a result of flooding since November 30 -- many of them swept away by swift waters. An airport in Rockhampton, a city of about 75,000 people, closed Sunday and was expected to remain closed for weeks, according to Emergency Management Queensland. At least 200,000 people have been affected by prolonged flooding, police have said. Police have warned residents who have been allowed to return to their homes about placing valuables outside to dry, saying some people could be tempted to take such items. Additional police have been deployed to affected communities. Prime Minister Julia Gillard has urged residents to stay away from the floodwater. On Friday, she toured the devastation and said the flooding in Queensland will cost ""hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.""

788,"New York (CNN) -- Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Thursday that some city snow plows will be fitted with global positioning systems in a pilot program meant to better track sanitation vehicles as officials brace for a winter storm. ""It gives us the ability to check on the location and progress of our snow plows,"" Bloomberg told reporters, saying that the devices will be added to some trucks in New York's Brooklyn and Queens boroughs where heavy snowfall last month left many residents snowbound. The city will also deploy scout teams to transmit video images of neighborhoods back to City Hall during clean-up efforts, the mayor said. He added that John Doherty, Sanitation Department chief, has made management and personnel shake-ups in Brooklyn following sharp criticism for the city's slow reaction to the holiday blizzard. That response has prompted an investigation into whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed clean-up efforts over frustrations of demotions and citywide budget cuts. ""These are only initial improvements,"" Bloomberg said. ""Certainly not the last word on the subject."" He said Department of Investigations Commissioner Rose Gill Hearn is also conducting an independent review over allegations of a slowdown. Joseph Mannion, president of the Sanitation Officers Association, said there was no coordinated effort to deliberately delay clean-up efforts among supervisors. The association later posted comments, saying: ""When you look around your neighborhood and wonder what the heck happened with the City's snow fighting ability you don't have to look any further than City Hall."" The heavy slow hampered morning commuters, delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours, officials said. On Wednesday, Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano replaced the man who led the Emergency Medical Service after 170 ambulances became trapped during the blizzard. ""This city will be better off with a different person in charge,"" the mayor said. The states of New York and New Jersey had loaned the city 35 ambulances to help reduce the backlog of emergency medical services requests during the storm. In one instance, a newborn died in Brooklyn after the mother waited nine hours for emergency responders, said Fire Department spokesman Steve Rittea. The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm watch for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut starting early Friday. Forecasters project between two and four inches of snow, with heavier amounts of snow expected over eastern sections of Long Island.","Mayor Bloomberg: Some city snow plows will be fitted with global positioning systems .

789,"(CNN) -- Trader Joe's has alerted its customers about the recall of products with a cilantro ingredient that may cause a serious foodborne illness. In some cases, the affected items are specific to certain states. For example, the 12-ounce, Spicy Thai Style Pasta Salad (sku 74441), was recalled by APPA Fine Foods, which supplied the product to California Trader Joe's, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. The pasta salad, which has sell-by dates of October 31 through November 6, contains cilantro that may be contaminated with salmonella, the government said. The packages bear the establishment number ""P-21030"" within the USDA mark of inspection. There have been no reports of any illnesses so far, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. Symptoms of salmonella poisoning can include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Those with weak immune systems, like infants and the elderly, are the most susceptible. Trader Joe's also voluntarily recalled the following products it says should not be consumed due to the potential for ""serious foodborne illness."" The company did not describe the illness: . All stores: Cilantro Dressing (sku 36420) with a sell-by date of February 9, 2011; Spicy Peanut Vinaigrette (sku 80947) with a sell-by date of January 9, 2011. California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon and Washington only: Cilantro Pecan Dip (sku 76986) with sell-by dates of November 20 and November 24.

790,"KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida (CNN)  -- A bat that apparently had trouble flying instead tried to hitch a ride on the space shuttle Discovery, NASA officials said. The free tail bat was last seen clinging to the space shuttle Discovery's external fuel tank just before launch. The animal was last seen clinging on the foam of the external tank of the space shuttle moments before the Discovery launched, officials said. NASA officials had hoped the bat would fly away on its own, but admitted the bat probably died quickly during Discovery's climb into orbit. Discovery's seven-member crew, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center on Sunday, is on a 14-day mission to deliver supplies needed to expand the International Space Station. NASA officials noticed the bat before shuttle's liftoff and brought in a wildlife expert to look at video images of it. The expert said it appeared to be a free-tailed bat that probably had a broken left wing and an injured right shoulder or wrist. The launch pads at the space center are near the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, so NASA has sirens to scare away animals that get near the shuttles. The bat isn't the first to try hitching a ride into space. NASA officials said they noticed one of the creatures on a tank of a shuttle in 1998. That bat flew away as the shuttle's massive engines ignited. The crew of the Discovery safely docked at the International Space Station on Tuesday. It was unclear whether its stowaway was still clinging to the shuttle.","NASA: Bat was last seen clinging on space shuttle Discovery before launch .

791,"(CNN) -- Mississippi Winn didn't get caught up in the amazing statistics that accompanied someone her age. Only 1 in 5 million people in the industrialized world live to be 110. About 60 people that age live in the United States, with another 300 or so scattered around the globe. Nine of 10 are women. Winn was believed to be the oldest living African-American when she died Friday afternoon in Shreveport, Louisiana, at 113. Investigator Milton Carroll of the Caddo Parish Coroner's Office said he was not permitted to disclose a cause of death, but a relative said Winn -- who was nicknamed ""Sweetie"" -- had been in declining health since last autumn. Robert Young, a senior claims researcher with the Gerontology Research Group and a senior consultant for Guinness World Records, visited Winn at Magnolia Manor Nursing Home in July 2010. ""She looked to be in very good shape,"" he said Saturday. ""It was a surprise she went downhill so fast."" Young believes Winn's parents were born into slavery. Her father was born in 1844 and her mother in 1860. But Winn ""never discussed it,"" said her great-niece Mary C. Hollins of Shreveport. ""She would say, 'I don't know about that.'"" Winn, who did not marry and lived independently until 103, appears to have lived a life that made her especially well-qualified for the elite club of supercentenarians -- those who live to be 110 or older. ""She had always been kind to others,"" Hollins said on Saturday. ""She was always respectful."" Shreveport Mayor Cedric Glover said the city has honored several centenarians. ""We have declared March 31 as Ms. Mississippi Winn Day since her 110th birthday,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Miss Winn's family, relatives, her beloved Pastor Clarence Hicks and her church family and friends who all loved and cherished her,"" he said. The secret to living to and past 110, besides not having an unhealthy weight, said Young, is a positive attitude and emotional and physical stability. Most supercentenarians take little medication during their lives, he said. ""They do things in moderation,"" he said. ""They don't get upset."" Most were still walking at age 105, he added. Born in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, on March 31, 1897, Winn moved with her family to Shreveport after her father died in 1908. One of 15 children, eight of whom lived to adulthood, Winn had a sister who lived to be 100 and a brother who lived to 95. She worked as a domestic, cooking and helping families raise children. She worked in Kansas City for a time and lived in Seattle, Washington, from 1957 to 1975, helping to raise three boys, before returning to Louisiana. Winn had a child who died at age 2, Hollins said. Before she moved to the nursing home, Winn lived on her own, doing her own laundry and walking around a track for exercise. She never learned to drive. Instead, she got rides or took a bus to the grocery store. She liked bingo and sewing and loved to cook vegetables and stewed chicken. Said Hollins: ""She didn't make much over modern things."" Winn was clear about what she liked. ""She was a disciplinarian,"" said Hollins. Right or wrong, it was her way."" A member of Avenue Baptist Church, Winn received visits from church members and was able to attend a service on August 29. The chuch will hold her funeral next Saturday. She outlived many of her church friends. ""When each one passed I could see part of her leaving with them,"" said Hollins, whose grandmother was Winn's sister. In time, Winn came to enjoy the attention paid to her age. But she remained even-keeled, said Hollins, recalling what her great-aunt would say. ""I'm just going to stay here until he's ready for me."" The oldest known African-American is now Mamie Rearden of Edgefield, South Carolina, who is 112. The world's oldest known living person is Eunice Sanborn, 114, of Jacksonville, Texas, according to Young.","Mississippi Winn died Friday at age 113 .

792,"(CNN) -- In her thoughts and prayers over the past year, Nadine Devilme has thanked God countless times for saving her baby after Haiti's earthquake. She's also wanted to thank the doctor who treated Jenny Alexis after the 2-month-old spent four days alone, crushed in the rubble with nothing to drink. There was one problem: Devilme never knew the doctor's name, never knew exactly whom to thank for treating her daughter's fractured skull and crushed chest and then arranging for her to be airlifted to a hospital in Miami. Meanwhile, the physician who saved Jenny, Dr. Karen Schneider, an assistant professor of pediatric emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins, has spent the past year wondering how the baby was doing. ""I want to know, is she walking, starting to talk, is she playing, because when she first came to me, I didn't think she'd be able to do any of those things,"" Schneider said. ""I didn't think she would live."" Finally, on Monday, the baby many call a miracle and the doctor who brought her from the brink of death were brought together. ""One of the few success stories of that horrible time!!"" Haitian couple await baby's return . Last week, Schneider sent me an e-mail asking if I had contact information for Jenny's parents. ""I would love to connect with her parents and see how she is doing!!"" she wrote. ""It is one of the few success stories of that horrible time!!"" Schneider, also a member of the Catholic order the Sisters of Mercy, had a layover Monday in Miami on her way to Haiti to work with cholera victims. We decided to meet up with Jenny and her family. Jenny's parents have lived in Miami since April after obtaining visas to enter the United States. When we arrived at the family's apartment, Devilme brought us into Jenny's room, where she was taking her afternoon nap. ""Oh my gosh, she's so big! So big!"" Schneider exclaimed when she saw Jenny. ""Marche? Marche?"" she asked, using the Creole word for ""walk."" ""Is she walking?"" ""Yes, yes!"" Devilme told her. ""Her smile, it goes up on both sides? Or does it droop on one side?"" Schneider asked, concerned that trauma to Jenny's head during the earthquake might have damaged the baby's facial nerves. DNA testing confirms they're the parents . Devilme, who's learned some English in her nine months in Miami, assured the doctor that Jenny had a normal smile. Once Jenny awoke, she proved she's a normal toddler, grabbing toys, saying ""Mama,"" taking a visitor's keys off a table and walking outside even after she'd been told not to. ""She looks like nothing ever happened,"" Schneider said. ""And we didn't think she would live two hours."" Devilme called over an interpreter to translate from Creole to English. ""I would like to say thank you for saving my daughter, because I always wanted to meet you and I never had the opportunity,"" Devilme told Schneider. ""For me, it's just a great thing to be able to say thank you to you."" ""You're welcome,"" Schneider said as she hugged Devilme. ""It's such a gift to be able to see this baby."" When they met Monday, Schneider agreed to be Jenny's godmother. A risky procedure . When the earthquake struck, Devilme was in one part of her home in Port-au-Prince, and Jenny was in another part with her baby sitter. Devilme was injured and taken to a local hospital, and her husband, Junior Alexis, who was unharmed in the quake, returned to their ruined home to search for Jenny in the rubble. He couldn't find her, but four days later, someone else found Jenny amid the concrete and flagged down a journalist who was driving nearby, who took the baby to a makeshift hospital run by the University of Miami and Project MediaShare. Schneider, the head of pediatrics at the hospital, had been up for 30 hours straight and had finally lain down for a nap when a nurse woke her up to take care of Jenny. ""She wasn't conscious, and she had head trauma -- she had an indentation in her skull,"" Schneider told Devilme on Monday. ""And another thing that terrified me was her chest was completely caved in and everything was pushed to one side."" But Schneider's biggest concern was after four days without any liquids, Jenny was so dehydrated she couldn't even get an IV into her veins. With no other choice, she delivered fluids directly into Jenny's leg bones, a risky procedure. Once Jenny was stabilized, Project Medishare paid for a private jet to fly her to Miami. ""Miracle"" comes full circle with reunion . ""This was a big, fancy executive jet,"" she told her. ""And I laid Jenny down, and she peed all over the leather, and then she opened her eyes for the first time and smiled at me."" Seeing that the baby was hydrated enough to urinate, Schneider felt for the first time Jenny might survive the two-hour flight to Miami. ""I was so thrilled, but the pilot wasn't so happy she'd peed on his leather seat,"" she told Devilme, laughing. An uncertain future . Devilme said she hopes to find a job and send Jenny to day care, but she's had trouble finding both. Her husband already works at a local restaurant. The family has permission to stay in the United States for two years. The International Rescue Committee is supporting them while they're in the United States, including helping them apply for health care benefits for her physical therapy. Her arms, which had surgery, continue to heal. ""I lost everything in Haiti,"" Devilme said. ""I have nothing to go back to, so I don't know what's going to happen."" Schneider thinks Jenny has a bright future. ""She's a miracle baby,"" she told her mother. ""For almost four days, she had almost no fluid, and yet she survived.

793,"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- As the U.S. House of Representatives resumes regular business Monday for the first time since since the January 8 Arizona shootings, the congresswoman shot in the attack continued to make progress, and mourners said goodbye to a staff member who rushed to the aid of others and a retired construction worker who died shielding his wife. U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was upgraded from critical to serious condition Sunday, eight days after being shot through the brain at a public event. ""The congresswoman continues to do well,"" University Medical Center in Tucson said in a statement Sunday. Giffords was among 19 people shot at the ""Congress on Your Corner"" event at a Tucson supermarket. Authorities believe she was the target of the mass shooting that left six dead and another 13 wounded. A 22-year-old suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, is in custody. On Sunday, the funeral for Dorwan Stoddard took place in Tucson. Witnesses said when the gunfire rang out, Stoddard, 76, was trying to protect his wife, Mavy, when he was shot in the head and fell onto her. Mavy Stoddard was shot three times in her legs but is expected to recover. ""He threw himself over me,"" Mavy Stoddard said last week. ""I think it was the last shots that killed him. So he saved my life, and gave his for it. And you cannot ask for much more."" A memorial for Gabriel ""Gabe"" Zimmerman, 30, also took place Sunday. Zimmerman was director for community outreach on Giffords' staff and was engaged to be married. In addition to Stoddard and Zimmerman, those killed included 9-year-old Christina Green; Arizona's chief federal judge, John Roll; Dorothy Morris, 76; and Phyllis Schneck, 79. The contentious issue of gun control was put in the spotlight Saturday when one of the 13 wounded in the attack was involuntarily committed to a county mental services unit after he made threats against a Tea Party member at a town hall event in Tucson. James Eric Fuller, 63, photographed Trent Humphries and said, ""You are dead,"" when Humphries began speaking at the event, according to Pima County Sheriff's Department spokesman Jason Ogan. Humphries told CNN that Fuller's comment came when the town hall discussion turned toward the issue of gun control. ""I was asked to give my thoughts on gun control laws and perhaps the passage of new laws,"" Humphries said of the incident. ""I said something to the effect that although gun rights and laws are not necessarily the primary focus of the Tucson Tea Party, our community needs to be given the opportunity to allow some time to pass and people to heal before we start this type of political dialogue.""

794,"(CNN) -- Still reeling from the January earthquake, Haiti is now in the grip of a deadly cholera outbreak. Aid organizations, already struggling to provide the most basic necessities, now face the possibility of a catastrophic epidemic. With this health crisis unfolding, relief leaders shared with CNN their views of where Haiti stands today, and what the country needs to get through to tomorrow. The International Rescue Committee was concerned that a waterborne disease outbreak would occur. Workers stockpiled rehydration salts, cleared water channels, and dug hundreds of emergency latrines. Even with planning for the worst, the IRC's director of humanitarian affairs, Gerald Martone, was not surprised when the outbreak was identified as cholera. ""It is the most feared disease in disaster relief, because it spreads extremely quickly and is lethal. People can die in as short as four hours,"" he said. Much of the group's health staff is returning to Haiti for this outbreak, and the IRC is trying to help stop the spread of the disease by protecting water sources, educating about proper hygiene, and improving disposal of human waste. Martone's biggest concern is a possible outbreak of cholera in a crowded camp, which he likens to holding a match to a tinderbox.  Thousands of Haitians have lived in densely populated tent camps since the earthquake destroyed their homes. ""In addition to preventing the spread of this disease,"" Martone said, ""you have to aggressively treat the people affected, as you only have a few hours before someone can die. This challenge will overwhelm the Haiti health system."" For those wishing to help respond to the crisis, Martone suggests supporting charity medical organizations working in Haiti. The International Medical Corps is also responding to the outbreak, repositioning its doctors and nurses and setting up mobile clinics to create a perimeter around the contaminated zone. The group is calling for more nurses to volunteer and preparing its doctor and nurse networks abroad in case this becomes an epidemic. ""Cholera is not endemic to Haiti. It is a new disease and health professionals in Haiti do not have experience with it,"" said Margaret Aguirre, director of global communications for International Medical Corps. IMC's medical teams are teaching Haiti's health professionals how to identify, treat and prevent the disease, in addition to educating the community about proper hygiene and clean water. For Martone, the outbreak reflects the level of hygiene in Haiti. When he saw the squalid conditions in the camps in April, he realized that, despite the IRC's best efforts, the longer people were forced to live in these unhealthy, filthy conditions, the more likely it was that cholera would break out. Aguirre also sees the continual displacement of the Haitian people as a constant concern. ""Water and shelter has been the continuing problem, it is a health issue,"" she said. The IMC medical staff is trying to transition from the acute emergency phase to a transitional phase, with more emphasis on long-term care. ""There is less wound care and a great need for more mental health care and chronic disease care,"" Aguirre said. However, IMC is still addressing the struggles with nutrition and hygiene that were present immediately after the earthquake. CAN-DO founder Eric Klein finds advancing the relief process challenging, especially when the initial needs are still not met. ""Food, water, housing, jobs and medical -- those are still the same five things that they need,"" Klein said. ""But now we also have to look to the longer goals, more permanent housing and infrastructure. We have to move to another phase, but the first is still not finished, so we have two phases at once now."" His CAN-DO foundation is trying to do both. Workers are training Haitians to construct home, school and medical domes. ""You have so many camps with tents and tarps that have now rotted and are duct-taped together,"" Klein said. ""People will take anything. They need more tents, they will take them, tarps, anything, but that is like putting a Band-Aid on it. There needs to be a better solution."" While his team tackles housing and the CAN-DO Orphanage Revitalization Project, it is still trying to conduct water and food truck drops. On delivery runs, Klein said he finds areas that have not seen distribution in months. Charity organizations are in the midst of transitioning their work force to address the desperate need for jobs. The IMC staff has changed since the earthquake to a more local face. CAN-DO has been training Haitians for housing construction and plans to help bring a factory to the country. ""Jobs is the biggest thing -- every single person you talk to wants to work, they are looking for jobs,"" Klein said. Until now, IRC was focused on education and training programs, instead of direct aid.

795,"(CNN) -- Ever since an 18-foot chunk of fuselage ripped off an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 in mid-flight, aircraft metal fatigue has been a worry in the aviation industry. A flight attendant died and eight passengers were injured in the incident, which occurred in April of 1988. To address the problem of aging aircraft, the Federal Aviation Administration says it has issued numerous regulations and 100 airworthiness directives. But on Friday the agency announced a rule to end the ad hoc approach to a critical issue of aviation safety. The final rule to prevent ""widespread fatigue damage"" requires aircraft makers and airlines to establish the number of takeoff-and-landing cycles or the number of hours a plane can operate without risk of fatigue damage. After the limit is established the rule will prevent airlines from flying the aircraft past that point unless they receive an extension. ""Safety is our highest priority. This rule provides a comprehensive approach to the problem of widespread fatigue in aging aircraft,"" said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. ""Requiring carriers to regularly inspect their aircraft for possible fatigue is essential to ensuring the highest levels of safety."" In June of 2002, three airborne firefighters over California were killed when their plane collapsed due to fatigue cracks in the wing structure. A similar accident killed two firefighters in Colorado the very next month. More recently, two Southwest Airlines Boeing 737s suffered serious fatigue cracks last year. One caused an 18-inch by 12-inch gap in the fuselage that depressurized the airplane and another led to the loss of a wheel-and-brake assembly during landing. There were no serious injuries in either event. Every flight of an airplane puts some stress on its structure. After numerous flights fatigue can trigger cracks, which can expand and connect. ""Widespread fatigue damage is increasingly likely as the airplane ages, and is certain if the airplane is operated long enough,"" said the FAA in its summary of the new rule. ""Existing inspection methods do not reliably detect WFD because cracks are initially so small and may then link up and grow so rapidly that the affected structure fails before an inspection can be performed to detect the cracks."" ""This is definitely a good thing they're doing this,"" said Chuck Horning, chairman of the Aviation Maintenance Science Department at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""It's not uncommon as an airplane ages that you'll find those things."" American Airlines had argued ""the rule was not justified in terms of safety,"" according to the FAA's summary of industry discussion of the rule. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing supported the rule. ""We already have some very good plans that are approved by the FAA that address this issue,"" said American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith. American says its fleet, on average, is 14.5 years old and getting younger as it receives delivery of new Boeing 737-800s and retires old MD 80s. The average age of Delta's fleet also is 14.5 years while United's is 14.3 years, according to the website airfleets.net, which tracks airline fleets worldwide. The Federal Aviation Administration is giving airlines and manufacturers up to 60 months to come up with time-in-service limits.","The new rule is designed to end the ad hoc approach to aircraft metal fatigue .

797,"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Arizonans paid tribute Friday morning to the federal judge killed in the deadly shooting rampage last weekend in Tucson. U.S. District Judge John Roll was one of six people gunned down Saturday when he dropped by U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' meet-and-greet in a supermarket parking lot. The funeral service for the revered 63-year-old jurist was held at St. Thomas the Apostle Parish in Tucson. Roll's service came a day after a memorial was held for Christina Green, 9, the youngest victim of the mass shooting. In addition to the six deaths, 13 others, including Giffords, were wounded in the gunfire. Arizona Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl, both Republicans, said Friday they will introduce legislation to name a new federal courthouse in Yuma after Roll. The courthouse is about to be built, and Roll, as Arizona's chief federal judge, recently approved the plans for the building, according to Brooke Buchanan, an aide to McCain. President Barack Obama described Roll as ""the hardest-working judge"" within the 9th Circuit in a speech Wednesday night at a public memorial at the University of Arizona. McCain called Roll ""a man of great qualities and character."" He had recommended him for the federal bench 20 years ago. Chief Justice John Roberts said Roll was ""a wise jurist who selflessly served Arizona and the nation with great distinction, as attorney and judge, for more than 35 years,"" McCain said. President George H.W. Bush appointed Roll, a Pennsylvania native, to the bench, and he rose to become the state's chief federal judge. Two years ago, he received death threats after ruling that a $32 million civil rights lawsuit filed by illegal immigrants against a rancher could proceed, a ruling that sparked outrage from radio talk-show hosts and others. Roll was placed under protection by federal marshals for several weeks. No one was charged in the case. The jurist also received criticism recently when he asked to delay bringing felons to trial in Tucson, citing a judicial emergency. He said in a November letter to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the ever-increasing number of federal felony arrests had overwhelmed his court. Roll also had been assigned to hear a case on ethnic studies, according to the lead attorney in the case, Richard Martinez. The case, out of Tucson, involves a new law banning certain ethnic studies programs in public schools. Tucson resident Jared Lee Loughner, 22, is facing federal charges in Saturday's attack. Police said Loughner targeted Giffords and had complained about the lawmaker for years after apparently getting a response he didn't like to a question he asked her at a 2007 event. The shooting set off a political firestorm across the country, with some pundits saying that extreme partisan politics played a role in the mass killing. On Thursday, family, friends, classmates and hundreds of mourners filled St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church in Tucson for the funeral service for Christina Green, the 9-year-old. All of them passed under a giant American flag that was recovered in the aftermath of the terror attacks in New York on September 11, 2001 -- the day Christina was born. Dozens of other mourners paid their respects by standing outside the church, which was filled to capacity. Obama noted Wednesday that Christina was beginning to discover the political system -- something that she saw ""through the eyes of a child."" ""I want us to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it,"" Obama said. ""All of us -- we should do everything we can do to make sure this country lives up to our children's expectations.""

798,"(CNN) -- A major winter storm system was rolling across the southeastern United States early Monday, sending out shocks of snow, freezing rain and sleet, and forcing some airlines to cancel flights. AirTran Airways canceled 14 flights Sunday, most of them heading into Atlanta, in order to have fewer aircraft on the ground there at the time the storm hits, spokesman Christopher White said. Another 270 flights were canceled for Monday, which represents a majority of the Atlanta-bound flights for the airline. There will be a handful of arrivals and departures only, White said. The latest computer models show wintry weather extending from northeast Texas through the Carolinas, bringing freezing temperatures, snow and ice to areas that normally don't see heavy winter precipitation, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. The northern regions of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas should expect heavy snow, while ice storms are expected to affect the southern regions of those states, he said. Forecasters expect freezing rain to move north in those states, possibly by Monday morning. Meanwhile, American Airlines reported that 100 flights in and out of Dallas-Fort Worth were canceled. That's about 20% of American's flights. Its American Eagle carrier has canceled 180 flights. ""That sounds ominous, but in the big picture it could be far worse,"" spokesman Tim Smith said. He added later that the snow was not as bad as was forecast and that Dallas ""really dodged a bullet."" Anthony Black, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, said the airline expects to operate normally in Atlanta until Sunday night, after which some 330 mainline and Delta Connection flights will be canceled. Nationwide, ""we have planned approximately 1,400 Delta and Delta Connection flight cancellations systemwide Monday as the storm is at its peak, approximately 25% of all planned flights for the day,"" Black said. Southwest Airlines reported it is running at normal capacity with no major cancellations. Track weather and travel delays . Atlantic Southeast Airlines spokesman Jarek Beem said the storm had forced a number of cancellations, Sunday through Tuesday. He declined to provide a specific number. Below freezing temperatures through Tuesday could leave trees and power lines across the south with a heavy coating of ice, said Hennen, which could cause numerous long-duration power outages. Winter storm warnings covered much of the Southeast as the storm system developed Sunday morning in Texas and tracked along the Gulf Coast. The National Weather Service has issued winter storm warnings for parts of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama. The agency warns that significant snow amounts could make travel difficult and dangerous. Three to eight inches of snow could fall by Monday evening and roads are expected to be hazardous through Monday night, especially secondary roads. Various winter storm watches have also been put in place by the weather agency, stretching from northeast Texas to the far western corner of Virginia. In preparation for wintry conditions, governors in Louisiana and Alabama declared states of emergencies, according to the governor's office in Alabama and CNN affiliate KSLA in Baton Rouge. ""We face a serious storm that will have an impact all across Alabama,"" Gov. Bob Riley said in a statement. He advised motorists to stay the roads. Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue similarly issued a state of emergency. Snow began falling in Atlanta during the evening hours Sunday, and is forecast to accumulate through Monday afternoon. Temperatures at or below freezing are expected to remain in place through Tuesday, keeping roads dangerous and travel difficult, Hennen said. Parts of Louisiana could get up to an inch of ice, while other states in the region could get between a quarter and a half-inch of ice coating power lines, trees, bridges and roadways, said CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. In Alabama, Auburn University canceled classes and viewing events for the BCS championship game on Monday night. Meanwhile, snow moved into the Northeast but the region was spared a repeat of the Christmas blizzard that virtually shut down large cities such as New York and Philadelphia. Emergency management officials were able to quickly recover from the comparably light dusting of snow that began blanketing the region Friday.

799,"(CNN) -- Boeing resumed testing Monday of its 787 Dreamliner in an effort to receive certification from the Federal Aviation Administration, a company spokeswoman said. The certification tests come two months after a fire on board one of the planes caused a power failure during a test flight. Boeing halted tests after the November 9 incident. Boeing resumed in-house testing of the jet on December 23, and the FAA certification tests began Monday, said Boeing spokeswoman Lori Gunter. Once the plane meets FAA approval, Boeing can begin filling orders for nearly 900 jets from around the world. The Dreamliner is Boeing's next-generation passenger jet. It is touted as a highly fuel-efficient aircraft made largely with composite materials. Boeing suspended test flights after the fire during a flight near Laredo, Texas, in November. The crew used backup systems to land the aircraft. Engineers determined the problem started as a short circuit or an electrical arc in a power distribution panel, most likely caused by foreign debris, Boeing said.","A fire on board one of the planes causes a power failure during a test flight .

800,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 struck Wednesday morning in a remote area of southwestern Pakistan, but initial reports revealed no major damage. The earthquake occurred at 1:23 a.m. (3:23 p.m. Tuesday ET) at a depth of 84 kilometers (52 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey said. It  was centered 45 kilometers (30 miles) west of Dalbandin, and 1,035 kilometers (640 miles) west-southwest of Islamabad, the USGS said on its website. Arif Mahmood, director of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, put the epicenter at 320 kilometers (about 200 miles) southwest of Quetta near Kharan, Balochistan, and said it had been felt in Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan provinces in Pakistan, as well as parts of Iran and India. Mahmood predicted major aftershocks. ""Earthquakes with such magnitudes in the past have brought on aftershocks,"" he told CNN from Islamabad. Residents near the epicenter in the districts of Kalat, Dalbadin and Kharan told CNN some mud-walled homes were damaged but no one was hurt. An official at Quetta's Civil Hospital said a female cardiac patient suffered a fatal heart attack during the earthquake. He said two residents raced to the hospital but they proved not to have been injured, just scared. Malik Muhammad Iqbal, the police chief of Balochistan province, said he was aware of no injuries. ""Things in the headquarters started shaking and books fell off the desks,"" Balochistan Police Inspector Sultan Mehmood told CNN in a telephone interview. ""We left the headquarters running into the streets -- scared for our lives."" In Karachi, Faraz Leghari, director general police, said he had heard no immediate reports of casualties or building damage. USGS initially reported the quake at 7.4. Quakes of 7.0 to 7.9 are classified as major; anything over 8.0 is classified as great. In Dubai, about 500 miles southwest of the epicenter, a reporter said he felt a moderate shaking that lasted for about 30 seconds. Usman Zahid, a night manager at Serina Hotel in Quetta, Pakistan, felt the quake. He said it was ""frightening"" and estimated that it lasted about 20 seconds. It left ""broken glass in the kitchen"" and made a chandelier swing, but caused no major damage, he said. People with Twitter accounts in New Delhi, Jaipur and Dehradun -- all in India -- felt the quake. People with Twitter accounts in Bahrain said they felt the quake. In Dubai, ""I was just getting ready to go to bed,"" said Leone Lakhani in Dubai. She said she texted her friends in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain. ""It's not uncommon for this region to have earthquakes,"" said Kurt Frankel of the Georgia Institute of Technology. It is where two tectonic plates come together, he said.

802,"(CNN) -- Red Bull Formula One driver Mark Webber has revealed in his newly-published autobiography that he drove the final four races of last season with a broken shoulder. The Australian, who was in contention to win his first world championship right up to the final race in Abu Dhabi, sustained the fracture in a mountain bike accident prior to the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka in early October. And despite needing pain-killing injections ahead of the Japanese and Korean Grands Prix, Webber decided to keep the injury secret from Red Bull principal Christian Horner. In the book, entitled 'Webber up front', the 34-year-old wrote: ""I was riding with a great friend of mine. Suddenly, he crashed right in front of me and I had nowhere to go but straight through the handlebars. ""I suffered what they call a skier's fracture to my right shoulder,"" he added. Webber, who went on to finish second behind teammate and eventual world champion Sebastian Vettel in Japan, continued: ""Suzuka is a brutal track so it was a blessing that the Japanese weather gave me an enforced rest day on the Saturday when qualifying was rained off. ""A pre-race cortisone injection helped me too and, in the end, we got through the weekend all right,"" he added. Although Webber has not blamed the shoulder injury for failing to lift the world title, his fortunes faded over the final three races. He failed to finish in Korea and his second place in Brazil meant he went into the final race in Abu Dhabi behind Fernando Alonso in the title chase.","Mark Webber reveals he drove the final four races of last season with a broken shoulder .

803,"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Northern Ireland's water supply is in a ""precarious position"" after several major water pipes burst, allowing 10 million liters of water to drain from Belfast reservoirs each day, the Northern Ireland Water interim chairman said Friday. The state-funded water company's response to the ""unprecedented situation"" was ""unacceptable,"" Padraic White said. Tens of thousands of homes and businesses have lost their supply after frozen pipes burst in a rapid thaw that followed record low temperatures last week. Many customers have been without running water since Monday, but some say they haven't had supplies for 10 days. Pipes at the country's top hospital, the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, were among those that failed, White said. Water service might not be fully restored until the middle of next week, but even then hundreds of rural homes could still be without water, he said. The water company's emergency call center was not prepared to handle ""a disaster of this magnitude,"" but communication with customers will be improved, White said. He recommended a full investigation into the company's problems. Northern Ireland Water has been heavily criticized for its response to the crisis, with some politicians calling for top officials to resign. Chairman White said company executives were not considering resignations, since their focus at the moment is restoring water service. The company said Friday that there had been an improvement in the situation in the past 24 hours and that the number of customers without water was down to around 5,000. It added, however, that as many as 24,000 customers could experience intermittent disruption to supplies as repairs continue. Northern Ireland Water has blamed the problems on a rapid thaw, with a huge number of pipes bursting after a dramatic change in temperature -- from minus-16 to 10 degrees Celsius (3 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit) ""within a matter of hours."" Company officials have also complained about a lack of investment in the water infrastructure over the years. The Republic of Ireland has also experienced problems with its water supplies. The government said Thursday night that most parts of the country would see a resumption of service within two days, but restrictions in the capital, Dublin, were expected to remain in place until January 10.","NEW: The water pipe to Belfast's top hospital burst .

804,"Nova Friburgo, Brazil (CNN) -- The death toll from devastating flooding in Brazil continued to rise Sunday, surpassing 600, the government said. At least 631 deaths were reported in a mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro state, northeast of the city of Rio. Other states in the South American country have also seen heavy rainfall. Are you there? Share your photos, videos and stories . Last week, authorities in neighboring Sao Paulo state said 24 people had been killed by flooding. Forecasters there said late Sunday that an approaching cold front could bring more flooding and landslides. Most of the deaths in Rio de Janeiro state were reported in the cities of Nova Friburgo and Teresopolis, with 287 and 269 fatalities, respectively. The state's health and civil defense department reported 56 fatalities in the town of Petropolis and 19 in Sumidouro. Officials in that office also warned residents of the risk of waterborne diseases. Several thousand vaccines against tetanus and diphtheria have been distributed, they said. Rescuers have not been able to reach some hard-hit areas, and many more people are feared dead. The rain is predicted to continue for several days in areas already submerged in water or slathered with mud. Members of the army entered parts of Teresopolis and were able to rescue 110 families. Thousands of families are still living on mountain slopes or on riverbanks and face extreme risk of being washed away. One resident described the disaster as a tsunami that fell from the sky. In a statement, Rio Gov. Sergio Cabral said he had a panic attack when he was traveling to Nova Friburgo and saw a devastated mountainside. Outside a makeshift morgue in Teresopolis, a crowd of people waited for their turn to identify loved ones. Marco Antonio Siqueira Costa said the last time he saw his brother, sister-in-law and niece was a few days ago, before mud buried their house. ""I think that last meeting was God's way of granting us a farewell,"" he said. Residents in the city donned masks and helped clean streets or deliver first aid. Others combed the city, searching desperately for missing loved ones. Red Cross volunteer Maria Helena de Jesus was helping with first aid. ""You have to almost have a heart of stone,"" she said. ""It was very difficult."" Teresopolis Mayor Jorge Mario Sedlacek declared his city a natural disaster area. President Dilma Rousseff flew over flood-affected areas last week and landed in Friburgo, the agency said. The floods are her first test as president. She trudged through mud to talk to residents in a neighborhood where four of seven firefighters trying to rescue people had been buried under mud. The other three were pulled out alive. ""We are going to take firm action"" to help the devastated areas, said Rousseff. Brazilian authorities have been criticized for a lack of disaster planning and allowing people to build homes in areas known to become treacherous in the rainy season. They are under increasing pressure to show a strong response. Brazil is scheduled to host the World Cup in 2014 and the 2016 Olympics.

805,"(CNN) -- The Trans Alaska pipeline is expected to return to full service this week after a leak near Prudhoe Bay brought the flow of oil to a stop this month, a company spokeswoman said. ""We are in the final stages of the bypass line,"" said Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. spokeswoman Megan Egan. The 800-mile line was shut down January 8 when a leak was found during an inspection of a pump house. The pipeline then was reopened from Tuesday through Saturday to flush remaining oil from the line. When the pumping resumes, the flow will start at about 500,000 barrels of oil a day -- about three-quarters of normal flow -- and then move to its full capacity, Egan said. The pipeline's daily average output is about 642,000 barrels, according to the company website.","A leak is found in a booster pump building .

806,"(CNN) -- As much as 8 feet of snow has fallen in parts of Japan since Sunday, slowing train travel and forcing automaker Toyota to close down 12 factories. The heavy snow disrupted the bullet train, or Shinkansen, system in central Japan on Sunday and Monday, affecting 67,000 passengers, according to Central Japan Railway. Snow totals on the ground Monday ranged from nearly 3 feet in Shimane Prefecture to 8 feet in Tottori Prefecture, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. Passengers on the bullet train network also suffered delays Monday due to a problem with a computer control system. The failure disrupted traffic for 75 minutes Monday morning, disrupting bullet trains nationwide for most of Monday morning, according to East Japan Railway. Toyota also had to close 12 factories Monday in Aichi Prefecture as heavy snowfall caused problems getting car parts to the facilities.

807,"Teresopolis, Brazil (CNN) -- Leticia Lima was buried up to her neck in mud. Her forehead was crushed and her teeth knocked out. ""I remember my mother shouting, and a loud noise. I hugged my baby tight. That's the last thing I remember,"" she said, lying bandaged in a hospital bed. Her baby and her mother didn't make it. They were among at least 759 people killed after flooding and massive mudslides flattened houses and wiped out entire neighborhoods in hillside towns of Rio de Janeiro state last week. Other states in the South American country have also seen heavy rainfall. Last week, authorities in neighboring Sao Paulo state said 24 people had been killed by flooding. Victims like Leticia Lima repeat stories of loss and survival throughout the Clinical Hospital of Teresopolis -- located in one of the hardest hit cities. ""On the first day, we treated 178 people in less than 12 hours,"" hospital director Rosane Rodrigues Costa said. Liziel Madureira was one of them. He managed to grab his 5-year-old son, but saw half of his family swept away. He then went on to save his neighbor and her three children. ""I would do it all again,"" he said. ""What else could I do?"" His 18-year-old daughter Erica also survived -- by climbing into a refrigerator. ""It shook and shook,"" she said. ""I opened the door and it was floating."" She cried as she recounted the experience, and said the family was still searching for her mother's body. As the rains subside, donations are pouring in from around the country. A gymnasium in Teresopolis is packed with stacks of clothes, water, rice and beans. Residents said they are starting to think about the future. Erica has hope because she made it this far. But she said she is worried. She is the only woman left in her family.","""I hugged my baby tight. That's the last thing I remember,"" one survivor recalls .

808,"Cap-Haitien, Haiti (CNN) -- Haiti reported more cholera deaths Wednesday as chaos reigned in this country's second-largest city, and cases among people who had traveled from Haiti were reported in Florida and the Dominican Republic. At least six people were wounded in related violence in Haiti. Photos: Cholera in Haiti . The cholera-infected woman who had recently traveled from Haiti to Florida was recovering, the Florida Department of Health said. Her case was identified through the state's disease surveillance system and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, where it was confirmed, the state health department said. Florida, home to about 241,000 Haiti-born residents, has asked local health care providers to watch for people who become sick or show symptoms of cholera after returning from travel to Haiti. ""We are working with our health care partners to ensure appropriate care of this individual and prevent the spread of this disease within the community,"" said State Surgeon General Ana Viamonte Ros. ""We will continue to monitor the state for any future cases."" The first confirmed case in the Dominican Republic was a 32-year-old Haitian construction worker who returned Friday from Haiti with symptoms of the illness, the health ministry said Tuesday night. The man, who was vomiting and had diarrhea, was hospitalized in Higuey, near the eastern resort town of Punta Cana, said Health Minister Bautista Rojas Gomez. The man was in stable condition, according to the newspaper El Nacional. According to data provided by the Caribbean countries, the Dominican Republic is the second-most popular Caribbean destination for American tourists, only behind Cancun, Mexico. More than 900,000 Americans have visited the island through August of this year. However, tourism and public health experts said that at the moment, the risk to tourists in the Dominican Republic were minimal. Neither case was a surprise, said Dr. Jordan Tappero, team leader in Haiti for the CDC in Port-au-Prince. ""CDC has been expecting to see cholera cases elsewhere in the region, including the United States,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. But he said cholera was unlikely to spread widely in the United States or in the Dominican Republic, since both countries have public health infrastructures -- i.e., chlorinated drinking water and intact sewage lines -- that are more robust than those in Haiti. In addition, health officials in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, have been watching the epidemic spread across Haiti for several weeks, during which they have been preparing by putting into place a surveillance system and educating the populace about what to do if they should come down with symptoms, he said. ""We are very hopeful that the magnitude of the cholera problem in the Dominican Republic will not be on the scale of Haiti,"" Tappero said. ""Diligence in public health messaging and people doing the right thing with water and food preparation and managing waste is going to be critical to that success."" In Haiti, the outbreak had claimed 1,110 lives, the health ministry reported Wednesday. Another 18,382 people had been hospitalized with the disease. The hospital death rate was 4.0 percent, far above the 0.0 to 1.0 percent that infectious disease experts said they expect in developed countries. ""It's telling me that the treatment is not optimal in the hospitals,"" said Dr. Eugene Gangarosa, a professor emeritus at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta. ""It leaves something to be desired."" The risk factors in Haiti make that country ""a perfect storm"" for the disease to spread, Gangarosa said. He cited ""a highly susceptible population, crowding, flawed infrastructure and a virulent strain"" of the bacteria, which the CDC reported this month as having resistance against some drugs commonly used to fight the infection, though other commonly used drugs -- including tetracycline -- are effective against it. Though a vaccine against cholera exists, ""health authorities generally have mixed feelings because it is expensive, it has some serious limitations and mobilizing the population to get the vaccine is problematic,"" Gangarosa said. Aid agencies appealed for calm in the northern port city of Cap-Haitien, where angry demonstrators accused United Nations peacekeepers of starting the outbreak. Residents erected burning barricades, then hid in alleyways and pelted convoys of armored personnel carriers driven by United Nations peacekeepers as they drove past. Cap-Haitien convulsed in a third straight day of violence. At Hopital Universitaire, the city's main hospital, doctors treated a patient with a gunshot wound on Wednesday afternoon. Soon after, wheelbarrows holding two more patients were rolled into the hospital. One man had an apparent bullet wound to the chest, the other a bullet wound through the leg. ""MINUSTAH shot them,"" said a man pushing one of the wheelbarrows and referring to the U.N. forces in Haiti by their acronym. During the night, a medical worker told CNN that the hospital had received three more patients with gunshot wounds. The violence occurred as medical workers struggled to cope with a dramatic increase of patients infected with cholera. At a basketball stadium that has been turned into a makeshift cholera treatment center, Dr. Esther Sterk of the humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF, known in English as Doctors Without Borders) estimated nearly 200 new patients had arrived overnight. At noon, an elderly woman joined the arrivals, her head slumping as she was rolled in a wheelbarrow through the gates of the compound. The stadium was packed with patients on cots, many of them being rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Those patients who did not fit into the main area were being quartered in a hallway underneath the stadium risers. MSF workers said a child died overnight at the stadium. They also said that some patients had been unable to reach the treatment center, their way blocked by protesters who continued to prevent most cars and trucks from traveling the streets of this port city. At one of the burning barricades in the center of town, angry residents chanted in Creole for the United Nations to go away as white U.N. armored-personnel carriers rolled through piles of burning garbage. The United Nations has a peacekeeping force of more than 10,000 foreign police and soldiers deployed in Haiti. The global body has denied Haitian assertions that Nepalese peacekeepers had introduced the cholera bacteria to Haiti. Aid workers said the tense situation on the streets of Cap Haitien was hampering medical and logistical efforts. Aid agencies have suspended clean water projects to slum areas, and canceled flights to deliver soap and other supplies to affected areas, a statement from aid agencies said. Supplies in Cap-Haitien were running out and the medical staff was overwhelmed as cholera mortality numbers climbed, said Nigel Fisher, coordinator for humanitarian action for the United Nations. ""We call upon all involved in these clearly orchestrated demonstrations to stop immediately so national and international partners can continue to save lives with our response to the cholera,"" Fisher said. ""Every day we lose means hospitals go without supplies, patients go untreated and people remain ignorant of the danger they are facing. It is vital that everything possible is done to contain this outbreak in Cap-Haitien while we still can -- but this is very difficult in the current environment."" Stefano Zannini, head of the MSF mission in Haiti, said the organization's medical staff members were able to continue treating patients in Cap-Haitien as they have been for the last 10 days. But, he said, ""it is not an easy environment to work in."" In the capital, Port-au-Prince, Zannini said the number of cases MSF is treating has increased significantly. In the northern slum of Cite Soleil, MSF doctors were seeing 10 times the number of patients than they were seeing last week, he said. MSF has been increasing bed capacity every day and hoped to raise it to 800 by the end of Wednesday, Zannini said. ""It's not enough,"" he said. As capacity rises, so do the number of patients. Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation announced Wednesday that it has committed $1.5 million for cholera response in Haiti. The foundation said in a news release that it plans to partner with Haiti's health ministry to train 10,000 community public health workers across the country. Also, it will purchase and distribute 10,000 portable treatment packs containing oral hydration salts, soap, aqua tabs, chlorine, hand sanitizer, garbage bags, educational material and stationery. The other $500,000 will be spent on a national awareness campaign. ""The recent outbreak of cholera is a devastating development for the people of Haiti, and serves as an important reminder of all that remains to be done in our work to help Haiti build back better after the earthquake,"" said former President Bill Clinton. The last cholera epidemic in the Western Hemisphere began in Peru in 1991 and spread to some 16 other countries, from Argentina to Canada, according to the Pan American Health Organization. From 1991 to 1997, Peru alone saw more than 650,000 cases. A similar pattern in Haiti could produce some 270,000 cases, which means public health officials likely face long-term challenges in Haiti. The United Nations denied an assertion promoted by some Haitians that Nepalese peacekeepers were responsible for starting the cholera outbreak. U.N. statements said the protests may be politically motivated to create insecurity ahead of November 28 elections. Symptoms of cholera, an acute, bacterial illness caused by drinking tainted water, can be mild or even nonexistent. But sometimes they can be severe: leg cramps, profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration, shock and death. Journalists Dmitri Foucard and Diulka Perez and CNN's Ivan Watson, Moni Basu and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","At least 6 people suffered gunshot wounds .

809,"(CNN) -- Four ferries carrying about 1,000 passengers have been freed from heavy ice off the coast of Sweden and were back in port Friday, said the Maritime Search and Rescue Center. Arctic winds hampered icebreakers' efforts to free the ferries and at least 30 other ships from the icy grip of the Baltic Sea on Thursday, according to Birger Knutsson, a spokesman for the maritime center, in Gothenburg, Sweden. The area with the worst ice was bounded by mainland Sweden, the Stockholm archipelago and the Finnish island of Aland, according to the Swedish Maritime Administration. ""It has been a lot colder than normal in the southern parts of the Baltic Sea. But in the north, all is normal, with normal levels of ice,"" said Tommy Gardebring with the maritime group. ""However, in the worst-affected areas, the icebreakers that normally operate haven't been able to cope with the ice. ""There was never any danger for the safety of the vessels. But we have increased our preparedness, just in case, since the ice puts a lot of pressure on the sides of the ships,"" Gardebring said. CNN's Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report .","Arctic winds and exceptionally cold weather hampered efforts to free the ferries .

810,"(CNN) -- Some of the world's largest airlines are conducting safety checks after debris fell from the engine of a Qantas Airbus A380 as it flew over Indonesia.  Australia's national airline has now grounded its Airbus A380 fleet indefinitely. How serious is the incident -- and what does it mean for the aviation industry? What do we know about the Qantas engine incident? One of the four engines on the Qantas A380, which was carrying 440 passengers and 26 crew Thursday, shut down shortly after it left Singapore's Changi Airport. The most obvious sign of damage to the plane is that part of one engine cowling, or covering, had been blown away. Debris was later found on the Indonesian island of Batan. Why is this being taken so seriously? This type of incident is known as an ""uncontained engine failure,"" explains Richard Quest, CNN's aviation correspondent. ""Probably something happened at the front of the engine, it ingested into the engine, out the other side and that's where the explosion or non-containment happened.""  Quest highlighted damage to the wing above the engine, including puncture marks.  ""Whatever event took place in engine number two, the debris from that event exploded outwards, removing part of the cowling and, it seems, going upwards through the wing."" Quest said the debris hit the wing by the forward slats, several meters away from critical areas such as the fuel tanks and fuel lines. ""Any form of debris that leaves an engine and has upward momentum sufficiently that it can go through the wing in that sort of mode has to be taken very seriously indeed,"" Quest said. ""That is why, in this case, Qantas has decided to ground the fleet."" Quest highlighted other signs of damage on the engine casing, including the presence of soot marks where the fan and combustion chambers meet the exhaust. ""That suggests there was clearly some sort of an event, some sort of fire,"" he explained.  Were the passengers and air crew in any danger?  While the incident was serious, the plane landed with no reported injuries. Quest said the pilot would have faced a challenging landing: one of his reverse thrusters would not work and he would be carrying too much fuel.   But air crews practice for such eventualities. ""This was not even a difficult landing for him."" How common is this type of incident?  An uncontained engine failure is extremely uncommon, said Quest -- but it has happened on several occasions before. In 1985 a British Airtours Boeing 737-236 at Manchester International Airport in northern England, caught fire as it readied for take-off. Debris from the engine punctured an underwing fuel tank access panel, according to a later Air Accident Investigation Branch report into the incident. The resulting blaze engulfed the fuselage in a matter of minutes, killing 55 passengers and crew. What do we know about the engine itself?  The engine used on the Qantas Airbus A380 is the Rolls Royce Trent 900. All A380s -- save those flown by Emirates -- are fitted with it, accounting for more than half the 37 A380s in operation before Thursday's incident. In a statement to CNN, a Rolls-Royce spokesperson said: ""Safety is always our highest priority. We are currently analyzing the available information and working with our customers to support their operations."" Shares in Rolls Royce dropped more than five percent Thursday in trading on the London Stock Exchange. What's the safety record of the Airbus A380?  The plane involved in this incident would be about two years old, with the engine of a similar age. The Airbus A380 has a 100 percent safety record, Quest explained. ""There have been niggles with the fuel systems and engines but nothing like this, they have more been operational issues. It is an extremely complicated airplane. The plane is designed for an uncontained engine failure."" ""The airlines love it,"" adds Quest. ""Everyone who flies on the A380 says it's quiet, it's roomy, it's comfortable.""  The incident happened in the same region as Indonesian volcano Mount Merapi, which is now active. Could this have been a factor?  Investigators will look at all possibilities. Earlier this year, no-fly zones were imposed across Europe due to ash clouds from Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull. It was feared that dust and ash from the volcano might damage airplane engines. However, while Mount Merapi is also in Indonesia, it is located several hundred miles from where the incident took place. IVolcanic activity has not yet been flagged as a serious possible cause of the engine failure. What is Airbus saying about the incident?  In a statement to CNN company spokesperson Justin Dubon confirmed that ""a Qantas A380 returned safely back to Singapore. The Singaporean authorities have launched an official investigation and these will be led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). ""Airbus is providing full technical assistance and is dispatching a technical team to Singapore where Airbus already has resident technical personnel."" Has there been any comment from other operators of the A380?  Singapore Airlines said in a statement on its website that it would delay all its A380 flights for the time being. ""Our engine manufacturer Rolls Royce and aircraft manufacturer Airbus have advised us to conduct precautionary technical checks on our A380 aircraft, following today's incident involving another operator's A380.""  Lufthansa, which operates three A380s, including to Tokyo, said: ""Our operations are as normal. We are on standby to go further but no decisions have been made.""

811,"(CNN) -- Colombia's president says devastating flooding forced him to cancel his scheduled trip to the United Nations climate change conference in Mexico this week -- even though global warming itself could be causing the disaster his country faces. ""I canceled the trip I was taking to Cancun ... to attend the international conference on climate change, which is what is affecting us, but I canceled this meeting,"" President Juan Manuel Santos said in a statement Sunday. At least 194 people were killed and 248 injured after torrential rains in Colombia that have affected nearly 1.6 million people, according to the country's interior ministry. The downpours have caused landslides and overflowing rivers, destroying at least 2,040 houses and damaging nearly 270,000 more nationwide, the ministry said. Rescue crews continued to work Monday after a landslide in the suburbs of Medellin, Colombia, buried between 30 and 50 homes, Red Cross National Deputy Director Jorge Ivan Nova told CNN. Up to 150 people were affected, he said. As of Monday night, they had found 23 bodies, Nova said, and more than 120 others could still be trapped underground. Seven others were injured. Better weather on Monday helped rescuers, but there was so much water on the ground that further mudslides were a risk, he said. Bersabe Alzate cradled her head in her hands and held back tears as she described the search for her family members. ""Two little girls, my sister-in-law and my niece -- they are trapped and they haven't been found,"" Alzate told Caracol. ""They haven't been able to get them out."" The landslide occurred Sunday afternoon, while volunteers elsewhere in the province of Antioquia held a telethon to raise money for winter weather victims. ""From this tragedy that has no precedent in the history of our country, we are going to forge ahead,"" Santos said Sunday after flying over some of the most severely affected areas, according to a statement on the government's website. Colombia is considering declaring a state of emergency to devote more resources to response and rescue efforts, Santos said, noting the number of victims throughout the country could climb to 2 million.

812,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Alex -- the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season this year -- formed in the Caribbean on Saturday as BP continued to battle a massive oil spill in the Gulf. Alex had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph) and was about 250 miles away from Chetumal, Mexico. It was moving toward Belize and over the Yucatan Peninsula. It was not clear whether the storm could hit the part of the Gulf affected by the massive oil spill that has been gushing since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20, killing 11 workers. A tropical storm in the oil-tainted Gulf of Mexico would disrupt BP efforts to drill relief wells and capture the oil at sea. It would also complicate efforts to clean up miles of coastline. High winds and seas could distribute the oil -- still gushing from a blown deepwater well -- over a wider area while storm surges could wash more oil ashore, according to a fact sheet prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the coast of Belize, the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, and various islands of Honduras. It means storm conditions are expected within the warning area within 36 hours. Meteorologist Karen Maginnis says the ""preferred scenario"" actually would be for the storm to head to northern Florida. That's because the oil spill has been gradually rotating counterclockwise. If the storm heads to the east of it, it would send the oil farther out to sea. If the storm heads more directly towards the central Gulf and Louisiana, it might push the oil toward Florida. Of course, forecasting where oil spills are headed in not easy. ""We're really in unchartered territory,"" Maginnis said.""We've never been in this situation before. We've never seen an oil spill that encompassed the Gulf like this, end up so close to shore."" She noted that the latest models do point to the storm heading to the central Gulf. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who's heading the federal cleanup operation, says he'll have to redeploy people and equipment to safer areas 120 hours (five days) in advance of gale-force winds. And he agreed there is ""no playbook"" when it comes to responding to a massive oil spill as a storm brews. ""But I will tell you there's been an extraordinary amount of planning being done,"" he told CNN. ""We are going to try to merge two response structures. One has proven effective in the past, and that's a central coordination of search and rescue and how operations are conducted, and that's done out of Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida for hurricanes. And we are in the process of integrating our planning processes so the oil spill response is integrated fully within the search and rescue recovery operations."" But a powerful storm would not just disrupt efforts to drill relief wells and capture the oil at sea, of course. It would complicate efforts to clean up miles of coastline. ""It's going to mean we're going to have to find a way to maneuver all our resources, change things,"" said Grover Robinson, chairman of the Escambia County Commission in Pensacola, Florida. ""We won't be able to fight the oil for a couple of days. And we have no idea about winds and current and what it will do to the oil in the gulf. So obviously, it's a very big concern for us."" Allen said he and some top Obama administration officials, including Vice President Joe Biden, will be headed back to the Gulf region next week to assess the oil relief efforts. But in a new blow to fishermen, Mississippi officials announced that waters east of the Gulfport shipping channel would be closed to shrimping, because of oil sighted in the area. Meanwhile, there been some promising news for potentially tens of thousands of people seeking claims against BP. Kenneth Feinberg, who is administering the $20 billion fund set up by BP under White House prodding, says that people who work in support of oil rigs will be able to file claims -- and not just fishermen and businesses along the coast. Employees of businesses that brings tools to oil rigs, for example, also would be able to file a claim. The company previously agreed to set aside the $20 billion in an escrow account for spill-related costs, a sum that does not cover fees and penalties that could be imposed by the federal government. BP had resisted approving claims by people who said they were affected by the moratorium on oil drilling, saying it was imposed by the Obama administration. But Feinberg said BP and the administration now have agreed those claims will be covered. ""I now have discovered -- I didn't realize this until yesterday, but the moratorium claims will fall under my jurisdiction,"" he told CNN. To date, almost 74,000 claims have been filed and more than 39,000 payments have been made, totaling almost $126 million, according to the company. In another development, there has been some promising news in the effort to permanently stop the leak. BP said Friday its ""ranging"" process, by which it sends an electrical current that puts out an electromagnetic field down the well bore, detected Wednesday where the leaking well is in relation to the first relief well, at a depth of 16,275 feet. BP said subsequent ranging runs will be needed to more precisely locate the leaking well and figure out how to best intersect the two. ""What they will do is continue to drill down in short intervals, withdraw the pipe, put that sensing device down and slowly close on the well bore to the point where they're ready to do the intercept drilling. This last part takes some time because they only do several hundred feet at a time."" said Allen. ""They'll also have a vessel standing by full of mud on the top, so in the event there were to get really close and potentially nick the well bore, they could actually put the mud down to control any hydrocarbons that might come out."" Drilling and ranging operations will continue over the next few weeks toward the target intercept depth of approximately 18,000 feet. ""Kill"" operations are expected to begin when the relief well reaches the leaking well. BP said drilling also continues on a second relief well, which has reached 10,500 feet. Costs associated with the Gulf oil disaster have gone up more than $300 million in less than a week, BP said Friday. ""The cost of the response to date amounts to approximately $2.35 billion, including the cost of the spill response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to the Gulf states, claims paid and federal costs,"" a company statement said. BP put the tab at $2 billion on Monday. Meanwhile, Deepwater drilling could resume by the end of July. U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Thursday denied a request to keep a six-month moratorium imposed by President Barack Obama on May 27 in place, pending a government appeal. The government has 30 days to show it is beginning to comply with Feldman's order and start issuing permits. The appeals process can continue, but until the appeal, the government must act as if Feldman's order will be upheld. Feldman turned down the government's request for a stay of his order late Thursday, and the Justice Department appealed that ruling to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. Government lawyers filed an appeal to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Friday, asking the court to stay Feldman's order pending the appeals.

813,"(CNN) -- Parts of northeast Australia braced for more flooding Thursday, a day after the nation's prime minister promised aid to flood-ravaged towns, and half of the state of Queensland was declared a disaster zone. Emerald, an inland city of 15,000 residents, had essentially been isolated by flood waters and was accessible only by helicopter. ""Things have changed drastically overnight,"" said Megan Lewis, a radio reporter with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, in an interview from the city on Thursday. ""Yesterday the town was expecting things to not be so bad."" Waters have reached 15.4 meters (51 feet) there and are expected to rise another meter on Friday, she said. Lewis did not specify exactly where in the town that level was reached. Some Emerald residents have been making their way to evacuation centers around the city, while others are stockpiling food and supplies. On Wednesday, the Australian government provided two Blackhawk helicopters to help evacuate all 300 residents from the town of Theodore, one of the worst affected by the floods. Queensland Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts said Theodore was one of about 20 communities that had to be evacuated because of the floods. ""Most of our major river systems have been in flood over the last week,"" Roberts told CNN. Besides Emerald, the other major population center threatened by flooding is Rockhampton, a city of 50,000 on the coast, he said. Forecasters have said the weather would clear over the next 48 hours, Roberts said, but the heavy rain the area has had so far means water has built up in river catchment areas. ""It does take a day to three days, in some instances, for that water to come down in some of the cities that are under threat, so we're over the worst of the rain, but some of the worst flooding is still yet to come,"" he said. The Bureau of Meteorology said flood warnings remained in place for many areas of Australia, with major and moderate flooding still occurring throughout much of Queensland's southern half. Thirty-one of Queensland's 73 communities are now receiving government disaster assistance, Prime Minister Julia Gillard's office announced. Acting Attorney General Brendan O'Connor said the government would continue to monitor the situation in disaster-declared areas across Australia and work with state authorities to provide more assistance.","NEW: City of Emerald is isolated, accessible only by helicopter .

814,"(CNN) -- More countries pledged aid to Taiwan on Friday, days after Typhoon Morakot battered the island and left dozens of villages deluged with floodwaters, killing 116 people. This image from an ireporter emphasizes the damage inflicted by Typhoon Morakot. Officials from Hong Kong said they would recommend sending HK$50 million (US$6.45 million) in aid. The aid request needed to get final authorization. Once that happens Hong Kong will join a growing group of countries and territories that have rushed to help typhoon-battered Taiwan. More than 30 countries have offered money, helicopters, medication or other supplies. ""They have presented the goodwill to help,"" said Benjamin Chi, a government spokesman. Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou toured the Jiadong and Linbian townships in Pingtung County Thursday, then visited Kaohsiung County, where a wall of mud had cut off the village of Shiaolin.  Watch why public anger's building » . Meanwhile, nearly 1,700 people were rescued from areas devastated by the storm, and a government spokeswoman said she believed ""the situation is getting better."" Janet Chang said 1,692 people were rescued Thursday, mostly from the two mountainous counties that bore the brunt of the storm -- Kaohsiung and Pingtung. However, a funeral director in coastal Kaohsiung County, where a makeshift morgue was set up, told CNN that about 200 bodies had arrived there -- many from neighboring villages. Relief workers cleaned and photographed the bodies, preparing them for identification by loved ones. Chang said that based on official figures, 45 people were injured in the storm and 59 remain missing. She could not say how many more people needed to be rescued.

Since the typhoon made landfall over the weekend, nearly 15,700 people have been rescued from villages hit by mudslides and floodwaters, according to official government figures. Most of the missing were in Kaohsiung County, the National Disaster Prevention and Protection Commission reported.  Watch a makeshift morgue and funeral » . Torrential downpours, dense fog, rugged terrain and raging rivers have made rescues difficult. Washed out roads and bridges rendered ground rescue operations virtually impossible in the central and southern regions of the island. Rescuers were forced to search by helicopter, inflatable boats and zip-line mechanisms that suspended them over the muddy waters raging below. In some cases food drops have been conducted over isolated villages tucked amid the rugged terrain, as villagers sought higher ground to stay dry. The Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan said that over a one-day period after the typhoon hit, Pingtung County received a record 55 inches of rain (1,403 mm). Elsewhere on the island, rainfall amounts were as high as 83 inches (2,108 mm). Seattle, Washington, one of the wettest U.S. cities, has an average annual rainfall of 37 inches per year (940 mm). The storm primarily targeted southern Taiwan. Isolated scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast for Taiwan overnight Thursday into Friday, mostly in the north, where the capital is located, said CNN International meteorologist Brandon Miller. ""As a whole, the weather actually is pretty good,"" he said. It was 90 degrees (31C) late Thursday. Miller said Taipei had had ""significant rainfall"" of 5 or 6 inches (150 mm) over the past two days. The Red Cross is helping the government dispense food, water and other necessities from a central command center, where helicopters pick up the supplies for their humanitarian missions, said organization spokesman Christian Li on Wednesday. Economic losses due to Morakot have been estimated at U.S. $274 million. After hitting Taiwan, Morakot roared on to mainland China on Sunday, killing at least six people and displacing 1.4 million, authorities said.

815,"(CNN)  -- More than 1 billion people all over the globe will observe the 40th anniversary of Earth Day today, which promises to be the largest since that first event in 1970. In 2010, the environmental challenges we face are global and call for new solutions. Forty years ago we were reactive. In 1969, the year before the first Earth Day, two environmental disasters grabbed the country's attention: a massive oil spill coated the coast of Santa Barbara, California, and the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, grew so polluted that it actually caught fire. Forty years later, with climate change looming and no strong international agreement in place despite the Copenhagen Climate conference, environmental activists are taking a proactive stance. They are arming themselves with the internet and social media to create another grass-roots movement for change, even larger than the first. How countries like India and China solve their future energy needs has an impact on people everywhere -- many developing countries are now pulling ahead of the United States on renewable energy -- and how the United States addresses its key issues will have an equal impact. Americans of all political stripes can agree on certain essential goals, such as how we must preserve the world's natural wonders for generations to come and how we must live in harmony with this world of finite natural resources. But not everyone sees the bigger picture -- that the global economy will improve by moving away from dependence on fossil fuel, that investments in renewable energy can create jobs and that a new revolution is needed to replace the outdated Industrial Revolution. It took 150 years to transform our agrarian society to an industrial one. But today, we don't have the luxury of time. Climate solutions are urgently needed. The challenge is to move from carbon-based energy and industrial systems into a post-carbon, or green, economy. A green economy relies on renewable energy and the creation of green jobs to prevent further pollution and resource depletion and sustain economic growth. Economic growth, quality jobs and energy independence are not mutually exclusive. According to studies gathered by the Environmental and Energy Study Group, a Washington energy think tank, energy efficiency employs 8 million and renewable energy employs 450,000 in the United States. The Earth Day Network and its partners are orchestrating large events in New York; Rabat, Morocco; Kolkata, India; Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Tokyo, Japan.  A massive climate rally is planned for Washington on April 25. Earth Day Network is backed by more than 20,000 organizations spanning 190 countries. All these organizations have a stake in climate change, development and growth, national security and energy policy -- geopolitical issues that must be addressed. Earth Day has become a  year-round imperative.  From public meetings to civic action, Earth Day's influence has created a green generation of activists, business leaders, and government leaders who are creating a new global green future worthy of the aspirations of the first Earth Day.

817,"(CNN) -- The head of the company at the center of a toxic spill in Hungary has been arrested, accused of public endangerment and harming the environment, authorities said Monday. Earlier, executive Zoltan Bakonyi had been questioned by authorities. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, told CNN affiliate MTV that he favored strong government intervention against Bakonyi's aluminum company, MAL Co. ""I proposed appointing a state commissioner to exercise control over the company who should manage the company and its assets until the tasks stemming from the disaster have been fulfilled,"" he said. ""I ask the parliament to accept the proposal. The company should be put under state control and its assets under state closure."" Much of the red sludge has been removed or diluted in the town of Devecer. Residents watched Monday as emergency workers and soldiers walked past in full biohazard suits. Military trucks and cars used to decontaminate the area came through the streets, spraying away the dark red dust that accumulates. Workers told CNN that they have been diluting the mud and removing it constantly. Meanwhile, an eighth victim of the sludge has been found, said Gyorgyi Tottos, an official with Hungary's emergency services department. ""We have found a body near Kolontar that is likely to be the missing person, who would be the eighth victim,"" she told CNN. ""The identification process is ongoing, but we think this is the person who's been missing."" Five European Union experts are due to arrive in Hungary on Monday to find out how badly toxic sludge has damaged the environment and advise on decontamination, the European Union said. And Hungarian authorities continue frantically building dikes in case the dam holding the sludge breaks further, the government said Monday. A ""large section"" of the dam is still showing signs of ruptures, the government said in a statement, meaning there is a ""continuing risk of a possible spill."" The area has been evacuated, and soldiers were on standby Sunday, an official said. The cracked wall is expected to collapse, Tottos told CNN on Sunday. ""We know that it will happen,"" she said, although when is unknown. About 800 people have been evacuated from the village of Kolontar, leaving it essentially empty, she said. Hundreds of soldiers were ready to rescue inhabitants of a nearby village if the wall collapses. A 50-centimeter (19-inch) crack has developed in the wall of the aluminum plant reservoir. If the wall collapses, 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge could spill out. That's about half the amount that spilled last Monday, inundating Kolontar and two other villages. In addition to the eight people known to have been killed, more than 100 were injured. Hungary's state-owned MTI news agency quoted Zoltan Illes, state secretary of environment, as saying the damaged wall could not be saved. Specialists had tried to reinforce the wall Saturday. Orban, the prime minister, who was visiting the stricken area Saturday, said it was ""very likely"" the reservoir wall will collapse. ""It's in very bad shape, and our estimation is that that wall could fall down,"" Orban told reporters in the town of Ajka. ""One consequence is that human lives could be in danger. That's the reason why we pulled out ... all human lives from that area, in order not to have more loss in human life."" The sludge from last Monday's spill reached Europe's mighty Danube river Thursday, raising fears of wider contamination in Hungary and countries downstream, including Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania and the Ukraine. But water test results released Friday indicated the sludge may not harm the Danube after all. The pH, or acidity, level of the Danube water was 8.5 Friday -- slightly above normal but not dangerous and able to sustain life, Tottos said. Readings of pH range from 0 to 14. Levels lower than 7 characterize acids, and levels higher than 7 denote bases; highly acidic or highly basic water can harm living things. The 8.5 pH level and fast-moving currents made officials optimistic that a natural disaster can be avoided, Tottos said. However, on Sunday she said that while saving lives is the priority, officials remain concerned about the long-term effects of the spill and want to protect Europe's waterways. But, she said, it's too soon to tell what those effects might be. ""What happened on Monday has never happened before in Europe, so we will see,"" she said, ""and we will try to avoid a bigger new catastrophe."" The environmental disaster occurred near Ajka, nearly 100 miles west of Budapest. The sludge covered the villages of Kolontar, Devecser, and Somlovasarhely, in some places reaching several feet high, leaving dead animals such as fish and frogs in its wake. The aluminum company, MAL Co., said in a statement Saturday it was doing its utmost ""to avoid further damages and to reinforce the injured deposit."" The company maintains it has performed extensive maintenance work and renovations in the past decade and had followed safety regulations. The company was working to construct dams and defense lines in an attempt to minimize damage, it said. It has also established a relief fund for victims of the spill and was attempting to help in finding accommodations for evacuated people. More than 1,100 residents of Ajka and the surrounding towns are MAL employees, it said. Orban warned Saturday of the ""toughest possible consequences"" for those responsible for the spill and said human error was the cause. ""Behind this tragedy, some human errors and mistakes must exist,"" he said. ""We will reveal all of that, and the consequences will be very serious -- as much as you can imagine."" The exact chemical composition of the sludge has not been revealed, but aluminum processing normally involves compounds that include cyanide, cadmium and chromium. Emergency workers have been pouring plaster and fertilizers on the sludge in hopes that it will counter its alkalinity. Dust from sludge that dries may also pose a threat, Hungary's Interior Ministry has said. It said some workers involved in damage cleanup may need filtering masks.

818,"Concepcion, Chile (CNN) -- Aid and increased security were flowing Wednesday into hard-hit areas of Chile, but some residents complained that they still had not received food or water since Saturday's massive earthquake killed more than 800 people. President Michelle Bachelet urged residents Wednesday to remain calm despite the shortages and lawlessness in Concepcion, Talcahuano and other areas of central and southern Chile. For the second consecutive day, she also warned that looting will not be tolerated. ""Nobody can argue that taking a refrigerator is an act of survival,"" Bachelet said. ""That is simply vandalism and delinquency."" An overnight curfew remained in effect for the third day in Concepcion, the scene of the worst looting. Authorities said they would take whatever steps are necessary to keep order, and 35 people were arrested for curfew violations. A military presence and citizen patrols appeared to maintain order in the nation's second-largest city, though CNN's Sara Sidner said that about 10 percent of the stores in the downtown business district appeared to have been looted. ""There was a moment when this was no-man's land,"" one resident said. ""This place was like the Wild West."" Some supermarkets were open, though checkout lines lasting two to three hours were common. The death toll increased to 802, with nearly 600 of those fatalities occurring in the Maule region, the National Emergency Office said Wednesday. Nineteen people were missing, said Patricio Rosende, the assistant interior secretary. Thirty trucks loaded with food and water arrived late Tuesday in Concepcion. The supplies were being distributed Wednesday. The city's mayor, Jacqueline Van Rysselberghe, said it was a good start but not nearly enough. The aid, she told CNN Chile, would be distributed in areas where there has been little or no looting. Concepcion is less than 10 miles inland from Talcahuano, but the two towns suffered far different fates. In Concepcion, the fatalities and injuries were largely the result of buildings that collapsed. In coastal Talcahuano, the damage was caused by a tsunami that roared into town about an hour after the quake. When the waters receded, they left large boats stranded inland. In spot, four shrimping vessels lay in a heap, stacked on top of each other. Much of the gritty port city looked as if a bomb had exploded in it: its buildings reduced to rubble, which was covered with debris. See scenes of devastation from the quake . The greatest number of deaths occurred in the Maule region, where disaster visited two cities in different ways. In the central city of Talca, an ancient municipality, the earthquake wiped out many of the older adobe structures, crushing hundreds of residents. In the coastal city of Constitucion, a large wave caused most of the deaths; officials said half of the city was damaged. Many Maule area residents said they had received no help. ""We have not received any aid from anyone. Nothing. Nothing,"" said Carlos Basoaldo, one of 6,000 residents of the coastal hamlet of Pelluhue. ""They are only concerned about the big cities,"" Basoaldo told CNN Chile. Security, too, remained a concern. The mayors of Concepcion, Hualpen and Talcahuano had urgently requested military help, and Bachelet said that more than 13,000 soldiers were being dispatched. Many of those soldiers started to reach their destinations Tuesday. But World Vision's emergency operations manager said the situation was safe enough for the non-governmental organization to distribute aid in two villages near Concepcion. ""Fortunately enough, we had the collaboration of the government and the army,"" Michael Black said from Santiago. He credited the extension of the curfew from 6 p.m. until noon. ""What emergency operations are doing is, they're trying to arrive with supplies through the city of Concepcion during the curfew,"" he said. ""That has worked really well."" Among the items distributed by the Christian humanitarian group were 10,000 blankets, 5,000 liters of water, 3 tons of food and thousands of sleeping bags, he said. Santiago, which suffered damage from the quake but was well on its way to recovery Wednesday, is about 270 miles (435 km) northeast of Concepcion. Concerns about the safety of those buildings that were damaged in the quake were heightened Wednesday afternoon, when a 5.6-magnitude aftershock struck 30 miles south southwest of Valparaiso, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Residents in coastal cities in Chile started to evacuate Wednesday after officials in the fishing village of Dichato and in the city Concepcion warned of a possible tsunami and said they had one hour to leave low-lying areas. The evacuations were halted minutes later when the National Emergency Office said there was no tsunami warning. Since Saturday's 8.8-magnitude earthquake, the region has suffered more than 120 aftershocks of 5.0 magnitude or greater, USGS Geophysicist Don Blakeman said. Eight of them have been 6.0 or stronger, he said. The aftershocks further stressed a frightened population. ""The vast majority of the population, if not everyone at this moment, has some symptoms like anxiety, fear, depression,"" said Dr. Graciela Rojas, a psychiatrist at the University of Chile's clinical hospital. ""I would say that the next three months will be a time of fear and sadness."" ""Basically, we are all under great stress,"" Dr. Matias Gonzalez, a psychiatrist at the University of Chile. ""People are afraid; they want to protect their families, and they function emotionally, not rationally."" The minister of public works said the country's major highways are open and no part of the country is isolated. In addition, Sergio Bitar said, air connections were being re-established, ports were being fixed, and food and fuel supplies were sufficient. ""There is public order,"" he said. ""It was a giant earthquake, but we are handling it well."" But Chile's economy, considered by many the most competitive in Latin America, also has taken a hit. About 70 percent of the nation's economic production has been affected, particularly fruit and mining sectors, CNN Chile said, citing analysts' observations. But officials said Wednesday that they are working to fix some sectors affected by lack of electricity and other necessities. For example, Treasury Minister Andres Velasco said, about 60 percent of the nation's banks are open. ""Our economy has dealt very well with this situation,"" Velasco said. He and Bachelet tried to reassure Chileans that there were sufficient supplies of food, fuel and other goods and urged residents not to hoard.

819,"Rio De Janeiro (CNN) -- As floodwaters receded in some parts of the state of Rio de Janeiro, the devastation from flooding in Brazil continued to climb Wednesday, and the death toll nationwide reached at least 765. Much of the damage occurred in that state, where heavy rains have liquefied hills into tombs of mud and debris. The state's death toll from flooding has climbed to 741, according to government figures released Wednesday. And thousands are homeless across the state. In Teresopolis, where 302 bodies have been found, one official predicted that the final tally may far exceed that. ""I think there may be five times what we found until now,"" said Maj. Carlos Falconi, who coordinates the rescue operation in what was once a picturesque tourist town and is now a wasteland. In Nova Friburgo -- the hardest-hit city, according to government figures -- 355 deaths due to flooding have been counted. In Petropolis, 63 deaths; and in Sumidouro, 21. Rescuers have not been able to reach some hard-hit areas, and the damage is not over -- forecasters predict rain for the next several days in areas already submerged. Other states in the South American country have also seen heavy rainfall. Last week, authorities in neighboring Sao Paulo state said 24 people had been killed by flooding. Brazilian authorities have been criticized for a lack of disaster planning and for allowing homes to be built on property known to become treacherous in the rainy season. They are under pressure to show a strong response. Brazil is scheduled to host the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016.

820,"(CNN) -- Here's what Katie Roche expected when she went into the hospital for spine surgery: two titanium rods, a bone graft, 17 screws in her vertebrae, eight hours in the operating room, and a week's stay in the hospital to recover. Here's what she didn't expect on top of all that: sharing a hospital room with a feverish 6-year-old and contracting a nasty bacterial infection her mother says nearly killed her. ""She got so weak she couldn't even get out of bed to go to the bathroom -- I had to carry her,"" says her mother, Kathleen Roche. ""For about 48 hours, I didn't think we'd have Katie with us much longer."" Because of the infection she picked up at the hospital, Katie, who was 19 at the time, dropped from 120 to 90 pounds. The bacterium that made her so sick is called Clostridium difficile, and according to a study out this week, it's more common than ever among hospitalized children in the United States, and children who get it are more likely to die or require surgery. The study found Clostridium difficile infections in hospitalized children went up 15% per year from 1997, when there were 3,565 infections, to 2006, when there were 7,779 infections. The study looked at 10.5 million pediatric patients from 1997 to 2006, of whom 21,274, or 0.2%, had C. diff, as the bacteria are commonly called. The study was published this week in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. ""This is huge, and really concerning,"" says Dr. Peter Pronovost, director of the Quality and Safety research group at Johns Hopkins University. What's really disturbing, he says, is that these children didn't have to get sick. ""Most of these infections are preventable,"" he added. Katie's story . Katie was a healthy 19-year-old avid soccer and volleyball player when she went into a New York City hospital in August 2008 for surgery to correct her scoliosis, or curvature of the spine. The surgery was successful, and she was discharged six days later doing well, except for a low-grade fever. A few days after she returned home to Katonah, a suburb of New York, Katie took a turn for the worse when the incisions on her back opened up and she began to feel weak. Her mother called the doctor, and he told her to bring Katie back to the hospital. Doctors found Katie had an infection -- not C. diff, but another bacterium -- and did a surgery to clear it up. ""When I woke up from that surgery I thought that was it, I was done, but they told me I'd be having another surgery in 48 hours,"" she remembers. ""And then I had to have another one, and then another one."" Katie and her parents didn't know it, but her situation was the perfect storm for a C. diff infection. She was taking massive doses of intravenous antibiotics, which kill the good bacteria in the gut, and C. diff thrives in the absence of good bacteria. ""I was throwing up all the time, and was so weak that one day I just blacked out in my hospital bed,"" she remembers. The antibiotic Flagyl cleared up the C. diff, but by that time it had ravaged her intestines. ""It took six months for me to eat normally again,"" she remembers. ""There's no excuse"" Across the country in California, Pacific Hospital of Long Beach has fixed its C. diff problem. Three years ago, the hospital had 5.3 C. diff infections for every 1,000 hospital admissions, and in the past three years it's had none at all, according to Dr. Alfonso Torress-Cook, epidemiologist for the hospital. ""It's frustrating, because some hospitals say there's nothing they can do about their C. diff rates,"" he says. ""But that's no excuse. They could do a lot of things."" Based on Pacific Hospital's success, here are some things parents can do to protect their children from C.diff when they're in the hospital. For more information on preventing other types of hospital infections, see information from The Empowered Patient and the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths. 1. Give your child yogurt . At Pacific, patients at high risk of C. diff are given yogurt because it helps restore the good bacteria in the gut that in turn help fight off bad bacteria. If your hospital doesn't offer yogurt, Torress-Cook suggests that you bring it in yourself and that one serving a day is enough to help protect your child. If a child can't eat, he can take probiotic supplements containing lactobacillus. For babies, breast milk helps protect against C. diff infections. 2. Know the signs of C. diff infection . If your child has watery diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, fast breathing, or is extremely sleepy, ask your doctor if it could be a    C. diff infection. ""It's not any one symptom, but the whole picture that's important,"" Pronovost says. ""If as a parent your gut tells you your child just isn't normal, there's likely truth in that."" He adds that parents sometimes notice signs of infection before doctors or nurses. ""Parents are with their kids all the time,"" he says. ""And nurses are by the bedside for 12 hours. As the attending physician, I actually have the least amount of time with the patient."" 3. Clean everything . C. diff spreads when someone touches the feces of an infected person, and then touches someone else, or touches a surface, such as a doorknob, that someone else will later touch. At Pacific, officials credit much of their success against the bacteria to a thorough cleaning of every room, even making sure to change the mop head between rooms. Torress-Cook recommends bringing your own disinfectant wipes and cleaning commonly touched surfaces, such as bedrails. The Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths has more information on how routine cleaning by hospital staff might not be enough to control C. diff. 4. Ask for a private room . Kathleen Roche says they'll never know how Katie got sick, but they wonder if she got it from a feverish little girl who shared a room with Katie during both her first and second hospital stays. The Centers for Disease Control recommends that a patient with   C. diff have his or her own room. If you're concerned your child's roommate is ill -- or that your child is ill -- you can ask to be separated. 5. Make sure hospital staff wears glove, gowns . After Katie was moved into her own room, her parents were told to wear gowns to cover their clothing and prevent the spread of their daughter's infection to themselves and others. They noticed, however, that doctors and nurses did not wear gowns when visiting their daughter. ""There should be no difference whatsoever between precautions for the parents and precautions for the staff,"" Pronovost says. ""If there is a difference, it's likely the staff is being noncompliant."" If you see doctors and nurses aren't gowning up or washing their hands, tell them, Pronovost advises. ""As a parent I know we worry we're going to piss off the doctor if we ask too many questions,"" he says. ""But the reality is it's your child's life on the line, so it's worth taking a risk.""","Katie dropped from 120 to 90 pounds because of the infection she picked up at the hospital .

821,"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- The luge track on which a Georgian athlete died during an Olympic training run will reopen Saturday after officials found it had no deficiencies, the Vancouver Olympic committee and International Luge Federation said. Officials will, however, modify the track at the curve where the crash happened to prevent the possibility of another fatal accident, they said. The decision to reopen the track at the Whistler Sliding Center came after the British Columbia Coroners Service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police concluded their on-scene investigations. The Coroners Service is responsible for investigating all sudden deaths. Technical officials from the International Luge Federation further investigated the accident before announcing the track would reopen. Georgian luge athlete Nodar Kumaritashvili, 21, was on his final official training run when he had a ""serious crash"" near the end of the 4,500-foot-long course Friday afternoon. As he came out of the course's 16th and last turn, Kumaritashvili was thrown from his sled and struck a steel pole at the side of the track. Although he was given CPR at the scene and taken to a hospital, doctors were unable to revive him, the International Olympic Committee said. Kumaritashvili had been scheduled to compete in the men's singles luge event, which begins Saturday. The track was closed after the accident. The Vancouver Olympic Committee and the luge federation, known by its French initials FIL, outlined their findings in a joint statement. ""It appears after a routine run, the athlete came late out of curve 15 and did not compensate properly to make correct entrance into curve 16,"" they said. ""This resulted in a late entrance into curve 16 and although the athlete worked to correct the problem he eventually lost control of the sled resulting in the tragic accident. The technical officials of the FIL were able to retrace the path of the athlete and concluded there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track."" The track will reopen after officials raise the walls at the exit of curve 16 and change the ""ice profile,"" they said. ""This was done as a preventative measure, in order to avoid that such an extremely exceptional accident could occur again,"" the statement said. The FIL said it will resume men's training Saturday morning with two full training runs before competition takes place as scheduled at 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET). Luge is often called the ""fastest sport on ice."" Sliders use their legs and shoulders to steer small fiberglass sleds down an icy track, at times approaching or surpassing speeds of 90 mph, according to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics Web site. They are positioned on their backs with their feet straight out in front of them and their heads back to be as aerodynamic as possible. Sports Illustrated's David Epstein, who is covering the Olympics for the magazine, told CNN's ""Situation Room"" that the Whistler course is the fastest in the world ""and not by a little."" He noted that while most luge courses ""flatten out"" around the 11th turn, the Whistler track ""just keeps on dropping so there's really kind of no break from gathering speed toward the end."" Epstein said some athletes had been complaining about the speed of the course and speculating that this Winter Games could be the first time the sport sees a competitor hit 100 mph.","Olympic track where luger died will reopen Saturday with changes to course .

822,"(CNN) -- Brazilian President Inacio Lula da Silva said Monday the government will do everything possible to help victims of flooding and mudslides that have killed at least 229 people and left thousands homeless. Lula said he will immediately make available 200 million Brazilian reais (about $112 million) in emergency funding to the state of Rio de Janeiro, where heavy rains that started Tuesday have caused widespread death and destruction. ""We can now say that the Brazilian people are saddened by what has happened in Rio de Janeiro and asking God, praying much, that it stops raining and Rio can return to normality,"" Lula was quoted as saying by the state-run Agencia Brasil news service. The largest number of victims from Wednesday's landslides have occurred in the city of Niteroi, where 146 people have died, Agencia Brasil said Sunday evening, citing fire department officials. An additional 150 people are believed dead and still buried in the mud in Niteroi, the news outlet said. Niteroi is located across the bay from the city of Rio de Janeiro. Another 63 people have died in the state of Rio de Janeiro, fire officials said. In addition, 16 deaths have been recorded in the city of Sao Goncalo, adjacent to Niteroi, and one each in Petropolis, Paracambi, Mage and Nilopolis, authorities said. More than 160 people have been injured and about 5,000 have been left homeless, officials said. Many of the deaths have occurred from mudslides in flimsy shantytowns built on the sides of hills overlooking the metro Rio area. Rio state Governor Sergio Cabral said Brazil would invest 1 billion reais (about $562 million) to construct housing, Agencia Brasil reported. The money, he said, will come from nearly 5 billion reais (about $2.8 billion) set aside in the national treasury for construction connected with the 2012 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics, both of which Brazil will host.

823,"(CNN) -- The 16-year-old son of actors John Travolta and Kelly Preston died Friday morning after suffering a seizure while vacationing with his family in the Bahamas, Travolta's attorney told CNN. Jett Travolta, right, joined his father weeks ago in Paris, where John Travolta has been filming a movie. ""At this point, we know that John Travolta and Kelly Preston's only son, Jett, had a seizure at around 10 a.m. this morning,"" attorney Michael Ossi said. ""All attempts to revive him were unsuccessful."" The boy hit his head after the seizure, but the exact cause of death is not known, Ossi said. An autopsy will be conducted Monday. His body will be transferred to Ocala, Florida, for burial, he said. Jett's death ""was completely out of the blue,"" he said. ""John and Kelly are happy when their children are happy. This is the worst day of John's life.""  Watch John Travolta and son Jett in Paris » . The Travoltas also have a daughter, Ella, 8. Bahamian police said a caretaker at the West End resort where the Travoltas were vacationing found the teenager unconscious in the bathroom. Jett Travolta was taken by ambulance to Rand Memorial Hospital in Freeport and was pronounced dead on arrival, police said. iReport.com: Can you relate to the loss of a child? Share your story . Jett's death was mourned by the staff and residents of West End, where the Travoltas were beloved members of the community, Obie Wilchcomb, former minister of tourism for the Bahamas, told CNN's Larry King. ""We in West End had admired Mr. Travolta and his wife, Kelly,"" Wilchcomb said. ""The people of the community of West End, particularly those who work at Old Bahama Bay, certainly today were in such shock, and they felt the tragedy because they had become a part of the community."" Wilchcomb said the Travoltas' love and affection for their son was apparent to those in the community.  See photos of Jett with his family » . ""Mr. Travolta spent a tremendous amount of time with his son, Jett. He never left him at home. He always brought him with him. And once you saw John Travolta, you saw his son, Jett. They were very close, very affectionate. Lots of love, you see at all times,"" Wilchcomb said. The family was on the island this weekend for a gathering of 60 family and friends who were arriving throughout the day as the tragedy unfolded, Wilchcomb said. In 1994, Travolta told People magazine that he loved fatherhood. ""I can't imagine what life would be like without Jett,"" he said. ""After he was born and cleaned up, I held him for hours while Kelly slept. When they came to take him away for various tests, I said, 'No, you can't see him today. You'll have to do it another day.' I went a little nutsy."" Jett Travolta had a developmental disability that his parents, John Travolta and Kelly Preston, have linked to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder of the artery walls that most commonly occurs in young children and can lead to heart disease.  Watch CNN's Sunjay Gupta discuss Kawasaki disease » . In 2001, John Travolta told CNN's Larry King that his son had a near brush with death related to the condition. ""I was obsessive about cleaning -- his space being clean, so we constantly had the carpets cleaned. And I think, between him, the fumes and walking around, maybe picking up pieces or something, he got what is rarely a thing to deal with, but it's Kawasaki syndrome,"" Travolta said of his then-2-year-old son.  Watch Travolta talk about his son's condition » . ""It was that the immune system overreacts, because they have almost the equivalent of metallic chemical,"" Travolta said. In 2003, Kelly Preston told Montel Williams that when Jett was 2, he became ill with flu symptoms, including fever, rashes and swollen lymph nodes, before a doctor diagnosed him with Kawasaki disease. Echoing her husband's comments, Preston blamed chemicals in household cleaners and pesticides for attacking her son's immune system, triggering the condition. A dedicated Scientologist, Preston told Williams that she credited a detoxification program from the writings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard with helping improve her son's health. Kawasaki disease is characterized by fevers and inflammation in the blood vessels that can be caused by a number of inciting factors, including virus, bacteria or infection, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said on ""Larry King Live."" ""You get pretty sick for a few days. In the worst-case scenario, sometimes it can affect the blood vessels of the heart, called the coronary arteries,"" Gupta said. ""Sometimes they can develop aneurysms in it. That's probably the most dangerous thing. But again, this is typically a disease associated with young children. It's typically in Japan, and it's pretty rare."" Gupta said it was rare for teens to display symptoms of the disease, which usually occurs in young children. ""Most of the patients are usually between 2 and 5 years old. Sometimes they get up to age 8. But it's very rare in fact for someone to be in their teens and still have symptoms of Kawasaki. They may have had it earlier in life, but to still have any manifestations of it is unusual,"" he said. The causes of Kawasaki disease are unknown. Some scientists think it's caused by an infectious agent, such as a virus. Some studies have noted a link between the disease and carpet cleaning chemicals. John Travolta gained fame in the 1970s, starring in the television series ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" and the movies ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Grease."" His career got a boost in 1994 with his second Best Actor Oscar nomination, for his role as a hit man in ""Pulp Fiction."" He also wrote and illustrated a 42-page novel for his son called ""Propeller One-Way Night Coach,"" a ""fable for the ages"" about a young boy whose first trip on an airplane changes his life forever, according to Amazon.com. It was a nod to Travolta's experience as a licensed pilot. Preston has numerous TV and movie credits, including a supporting role in 1996's ""Jerry Maguire.""

824,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A California food processing plant is voluntarily recalling up to 1 million pounds of roasted pistachio products that may have been contaminated with salmonella, the Food and Drug Administration announced Monday. Salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by Kraft Foods, one company that purchased the nuts. The nuts came from Setton Farms in Terra Bella, California, about 75 miles south of Fresno. They were largely distributed in 2,000-pound containers to food wholesalers who would then package them for resale or incorporate them as ingredients in other products, such as ice cream and trail mix. No illnesses have been linked to this case, said Dr. David Acheson, FDA's associate commissioner. But salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by Kraft Foods, one of about three dozen companies that purchase pistachios from Setton Farms, he said. Kraft notified the FDA on March 24. Setton Farms did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Acheson emphasized that unlike the recent case of salmonella-tainted peanut butter, this recall was not prompted by an sickness outbreak, saying the decision was a ""proactive"" move. He said the FDA has received two recent complaints, from the East and West coasts, from people who say they became ill after eating pistachio products, but a link to Setton Farms has not been confirmed, he said. The FDA is advising consumers not to eat any pistachio products, but not to throw them out, either, because additional recalls are likely and having products that could be turned in would allow for easier tracing of contamination. The agency is setting up a Web site to update the public. Dr. Jeff Farrar, head of the California health department's food and drug division, said it's likely that the roasted pistachios will be found in a wide variety of products. He noted that Setton Farms is the second-largest pistachio processor in the nation. Raw pistachios are roasted to a temperature that should kill salmonella, Acheson said. Because the roasted products tested positive for salmonella suggest cross-contamination with raw products. Acheson added that the Setton Farms recall is related to the one announced Friday by Kroger, a grocery store chain with stores in 31 states. Kroger recalled Private Selection shelled pistachios from its retail stores because of possible salmonella contamination. Kroger, in a statement Friday, said no illnesses have been reported in connection with the product. In February, Kroger was among retailers that recalled peanut products tied to the Peanut Corporation of America, a Virginia-based company accused by the FDA of knowingly selling peanut butter and peanut paste that was contaminated with salmonella. PCA's peanut processing plant in Blakely, Georgia, is being investigated in connection with a salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 500 people and has been linked to eight deaths.","The pistachios, mostly sold to wholesalers, came from Setton Farms in California .

825,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The miners who survived 69 days in a Chilean mine toured Hollywood and Sunset Boulevard in two double-decker buses Thursday evening, receiving cheers and a hero's welcome from passersby in the the street. The miners serenaded anyone who would listen. ""Chi-chi-chi!"" ""Le-le-le!"" ""We the miners of Chile!"" they sang in unison. Some people from the street and even a rooftop sang ""Chile!"" in return. The 33 miners, along with relatives and five of their rescuers, landed in Los Angeles earlier in the day Thursday for their . first group tour to the United States since being freed last month. The group is in the nation's second-largest city to attend ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,"" which will air worldwide on . Thanksgiving evening, November 25. Organizers invited them as special guests. The Los Angeles police department gave the miners' two-bus entourage a motorcycle escort from Los Angeles International Airport to a downtown hotel. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa greeted the group at the hotel with the traditional Spanish saying of ""mi casa es su casa,"" or ""my house is your house."" ""The entire world was watching the success of your rescue,"" Villaraigosa told the group. Later, the miners, rescuers and their relatives ventured outside the hotel for the first time and found a TV news helicopter and local news stations filming them as they boarded two double-decker buses. The entourage visited Hollywood landmarks such as the Walk of Fame stars on Hollywood Boulevard, including one belonging to Elvis Presley. It was an appropriate pilgrimage because miner Edison Pena had led sing-alongs to Elvis music to lift the spirits of fellow miners during the dark ordeal. In fact, he had asked for the music to be sent down into the mine as rescuers drilled a bigger hole to pull the miners out of the ground. ""He is the king, he is the best,"" Pena, 34, said, as he posed for photographs beside Elvis' star on Hollywood Boulevard. ""The sweetest of dreams."" The entourage strolled outside the landmark Capitol Records building, built to resemble a stack of records on a turntable. They walked to the heart of the Hollywood noir district, at Hollywood and Vine Boulevards, which is enjoying a construction boom. They also toured Beverly Hills and its Rodeo Drive boutique district. Bus guides also showed them the grand business concourse of Wilshire Boulevard. Throughout the sightseeing, the miners, wives and relatives took photographs on their cameras or smartphones. Shortly after their arrival at the hotel Thursday morning, the miner known as ""the poet"" was freewheeling in the hallway with the other miner known as ""Super Mario."" ""Where can we go dancing?"" shouted Mario Sepulveda, 40, the Chilean miner whose exuberant personality earned him the super nickname. He and Victor Zamora, 34, the miner-poet, were expressing the collective excitement of the miners, rescuers and their families. For the majority of the visitors, the trip was their first time outside of Chile. At the top of their to-do list, besides resting after a 12-hour flight from Santiago, Chile, was shopping. ""I want to go to the mall and buy some shoes for my son and daughter,"" said Katty Valdivia, 40, the wife of Sepulveda. For miner Juan Carlos Aguilar, 49, and wife Cristy Coronado, 40, the visit was a double celebration -- because they experienced the birth of their first grandchild, Emily Sofia Studer, born Wednesday. When Aguilar was trapped in the mine for 69 days, his wife was concerned whether the ordeal would be too much of a strain on her pregnant 17-year-old daughter, Damaris. ""We were really worried,"" Coronado said, speaking in Spanish as did his colleagues. ""My daughter was far into her pregnancy and we were all consumed with what could happen. For those 69 days, we were a separated family."" The miner-poet Zamora said he overcame the gloom of entrapment by doing something he had never done before: write poetry. He wrote 32 poems -- about his wife, mother, son, relatives, friends. He left copies of his verse at home and was unable to share his poetry. ""I never wrote before,"" Zamora said. ""It was a way of keeping me from suffering inside the mine. I wrote about feelings and how people were suffering on the outside and how they would ever rescue us."" Like some other miners, he readily offered up his autographs to anyone wanting to meet him. ""The Poet,"" he wrote in Spanish near his name. Monica Araya, the wife of Florencio Avalos, the first miner who was pulled out of the ground last month, described the 69 days of waiting and wondering as one of her worst experiences. ""It was bad, really bad,"" said Araya. ""I couldn't believe it. I was worried about his life, but I believed they would all survive because I had faith and hope."" She has since noticed a few different things about herself and husband. ""We have changed,"" Araya said. ""We are more sentimental, and we enjoy more what moments we have together."" Before arriving in Los Angeles, the group made a brief stopover at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, where the miners signed flags. One signed ""Corazon de Minero,"" which means ""heart of a miner."" When miner Richard Villarroell prepared to board the plane in Santiago, Chile, on Wednesday night, the 27-year-old said he has only traveled to Argentina. ""I want to see the world,"" he said, smiling. ""I know all of Chile, but not the rest of the world."" Villarroell, a mechanic, worked at the San Jose mine for two years. His girlfriend was pregnant while he was trapped. The miners captured the world's imagination when they survived the longest mine entrapment in history, beginning August 5. For more than two weeks, many officials thought they were dead. But crews made contact after a small borehole enabled communication with the men trapped 2,300 feet underground. Rescue crews encountered repeated setbacks. Initially, authorities expected the miners to be trapped until Thanksgiving or Christmas because of the difficulty of drilling a new tunnel to extract them. On their U.S. trip, the miners and rescuers will get a whirlwind tour of southern California. They'll see the sights and shop in Los Angeles and Hollywood through the weekend. The visit is a world away from the miners' experience in the weeks after the mine collapse that trapped them. In the days before they made contact with the ground, some ate about a bottle cap's worth of canned fish per day and drank mine water that tasted like machine oil. They have said they were prepared to die, even as they awaited their rescue. The miners and rescuers were invited by CNN to attend ""Heroes,"" an annual program now in its fourth year that shines a light on ""everyday people changing the world."" The Chileans were extended the invitation because their plight and rescue captured the world's attention and symbolized the resilience of the human spirit. CNN Heroes received 10,000 nominations from more than 100 countries. That list was narrowed down to the Top 10 CNN Heroes. The Hero of the Year will be revealed on the show; the public votes to select that winner. ""The heroic efforts of the rescue of these miners was one of the most unifying and inspirational events of the year,"" said Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide. ""CNN Heroes is a fitting way for CNN to honor these men and their rescuers,"" he said. ""We hope viewers around the world will be heartened by the story of their rescue as well as the stories of this year's top 10 CNN Heroes.""' The miners' imprisonment began when a ramp into the San Jose mine -- located in the arid Atacama region of northern Chile -- collapsed. Shift foreman Luis Urzua told the men that they had a shot of surviving the catastrophe, but there was a good chance they would never again see daylight. The men occupied themselves by voting on everything, including how food should be distributed. Majority rule prevailed -- 17 votes plus one -- but the miners often managed to find common ground and most decisions were unanimous. Everyone had a task. No one was left alone. And they became masters of compromise and patience, even as their rations quickly began running out. CNN's Alec Miran and Lonzo Cook contributed to this report.","NEW: Miners and their relatives sing ""We the miners of Chile"" from double-decker buses .

826,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The regional airline involved in a fatal February plane crash outside Buffalo, New York, contested a report Monday alleging the pilot did not have the training to handle the emergency that brought the plane down, and that he might have been fatigued on the night of the crash. Debris is cleared from the scene of Flight 3407's crash near Buffalo, New York, in February. Continental Connection Flight 3407, operated by regional carrier Colgan Air, plunged into a house in Clarence Center, New York, on the night of February 12, killing all 49 on board as well as one man in the house. In a story Monday, The Wall Street Journal cited investigators as saying the crash resulted from pilot Marvin Renslow's incorrect response to the plane's precarious drop in speed: He overrode an emergency system known as a ""stick pusher,"" which sends the plane into a dive so it can regain speed and avoid a stall. The Journal's report said Colgan had not provided Renslow with hands-on flight-simulator training for a stick-pusher emergency. Colgan, in rebuttal, issued a statement saying Renslow had received classroom instruction for such an emergency.  Watch a Colgan official respond to questions » . The company also emphasized that the Federal Aviation Administration does not require pilots to receive a stick-pusher demonstration in a flight simulator. ""The FAA generally trains to standards of routine line operations. They don't focus on the edges of the envelope,"" stall recovery expert Doug Moss told CNN. Colgan further admitted that during his career, Renslow failed five ""check rides"" -- occasional tests of pilot proficiency -- including two that Colgan said he did not disclose on his application with the airline. His most recent failed check ride occurred 16 months before the crash. ""In the cases while with Colgan, he received additional training and successfully passed the check rides,"" the airline said. Colgan stressed that despite his performance on check rides, Renslow nonetheless ultimately passed his pilot exams and had ""all the training and experience to safely operate the Q400,"" the airplane involved in the crash. Colgan further insisted that pilot fatigue was not a factor in the crash, noting that Renslow had ""nearly 22 consecutive hours of time off before he reported for duty on the day of the accident."" In its statement, Colgan did not specifically address potential illness-related fatigue in 24-year-old co-pilot Rebecca Shaw, who, according to The Wall Street Journal report, said before takeoff that she probably should have called in sick. The National Transportation Safety Board begins a three-day hearing on the crash on Tuesday. Renslow's history as well as pilot training broadly will be examined.","Continental Connection Flight 3407 crashed near Buffalo in February; 50 people died .

827,"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo has escaped punishment over the car smash earlier this year that saw his Ferrari written off. Ronaldo's Ferrari was a complete write-off after his accident on the way to training. The Manchester United star, who is set to move to Real Madrid for a world record fee, demolished the front of his high-performance sports car after he hit a roadside barrier in a tunnel on a freeway in the north-west of England city. No other vehicle was involved and Ronaldo escaped injury. He spoke to police officers at the scene and was also later interviewed as well as giving a written statement. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman told Press Association Tuesday. ""No further action will be taken against the driver of a Ferrari 599 GTB, which collided with a wall on the A538 Wilmslow Road on Thursday, January 8. ""No-one was injured and no other vehicles were involved in the incident."" It was reported that the Portuguese star had only owned the top-of-the-range sports car for just a few days before the accident. The impact of the crash saw one of the Ferrari's wheels come off and end up 200 meters away, with skid marks on the road clearly prominent. The FIFA World Player of the Year walked away from the smash and was given a lift to training that morning by then Manchester United teammate Edwin van der Sar who had been driving along the same stretch of road behind him. Dutchman Van de Sar also provided a statement to police about the incident. Real Madrid and Manchester United confirmed last week that they had reached a deal to send Ronaldo to the Bernabeu, but it has still to be officially sealed.","Manchester police will not take action over Cristiano Ronaldo car crash .

828,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The pilot who landed a crippled US Airways jetliner on the Hudson River thought there would have been ""catastrophic consequences"" if he tried to make it to a nearby airport, a National Transportation Safety Board official said Saturday night. US Airways Flight 1549 remained in the icy Hudson River on Saturday. Instead, pilot Pilot C.B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger decided to ditch the plane in the Hudson River close to vessels moving about the water ""to improve chances of recovery,"" NTSB board member Kitty Higgins said. It was the first time the public heard comments from Sullenberger and first officer Jeffrey B. Skiles describing Thursday's emergency landing. Skiles was flying US Airways Flight 1549, bound for Charlotte, North Carolina, when he noticed a flock of birds less than 90 seconds after the plane had taken off from New York's LaGuardia International Airport, Higgins said. In an instant, the plane was rocked by loud thuds and both engines went out, Higgins said.  Watch the plane hit the water » . ""He commented on the formation, and he said the next thing he knew, the windscreen was filled with birds. There was no time to take evasive action,"" Higgins said. Sullenberger took control of the aircraft while Skiles began complicated procedures to try to restart the engines, Higgins said. Sullenberger thought the plane was moving ""too low, too slow"" to risk returning to LaGuardia through the maze of buildings. Nor did Sullenberger think the powerless aircraft could make it over the densely populated New Jersey area to Teterboro, Higgins said. ""There could be catastrophic consequences if we didn't make it,"" she quoted Sullenberger as saying.  Watch CNN's Lisa Sylvester report on the pilots » . City officials, passengers and aviation experts have lauded Sullenberger and the flight crew for their handling of the landing and also praised first responders who acted quickly to minimize passengers' injuries in below-freezing temperatures. All 155 people on board the plane survived. ""These are both very experienced pilots. They knew what they had to do,"" Higgins said. Neither Sullenberger nor Skiles attended the news conference. Earlier in the day, the NTSB revealed the content of communications between the cockpit and controllers at LaGuardia in the brief period during which the incident unfolded. ""This is cactus 1549, hit birds, we lost thrust in both engines,"" Sullenberger told controllers at approximately 3:27 p.m. Thursday. ""We're turning back towards LaGuardia."" Controllers immediately began preparations to clear a runway for an emergency landing, but less than a minute later, Sullenberger reported that the aircraft wouldn't make it, Higgins said. The last communication from the plane to controllers, Higgins said, was the pilot saying, ""We're gonna be in the Hudson.""  Watch a former pilot tell how to water-land a plane » . Higgins also quoted two of the flight's attendants, who were in jump seats at the front of the aircraft when they heard a loud thud shortly after takeoff. ""It was a sound that neither one of them had ever heard before,"" Higgins said. ""They said all the engine noise ceased. They described it as complete silence, like a library."" Efforts to raise the jetliner from the river proved successful late Saturday, as cranes lifted it clear of the water about 11:30 p.m. ET following several hours of work by crews in frigid conditions. Video from the scene showed the right side of the aircraft with the engine intact but its covering mangled. It was not clear visually whether the damage was from an in-flight incident or from the landing impact. Investigators planned to tow the plane on a barge to an undisclosed location for their examination.  Watch water wash over the plane » . Searchers using sonar think they have found the left engine on the river bottom. Divers will try to confirm the finding, Higgins said.  Watch workers begin the retrieval process » . The flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- both crucial to determining exactly what happened Thursday -- remained on the aircraft, which was still largely submerged in the Hudson River but was secured to moorings. Strong currents and cold water thwarted divers' efforts to retrieve the recorders from the tail section of the jetliner, Higgins said. Also Saturday, authorities released audio and transcripts of two 911 calls from people who said they saw that the plane was in trouble.  Listen to callers report plane in the river » . One caller said he saw the plane descend and reported hearing a loud noise shortly after the aircraft took off. ""Oh, my God! It was a big plane, I heard a big boom just now. We looked up, and the plane came straight over us, and it was turning. Oh, my God!"" a man calling from the Bronx told a 911 operator at 3:29 p.m., three minutes after the plane left LaGuardia. Minutes later, at 3:33 p.m., a woman called 911 and reported seeing the plane in the water. ""A plane has just crashed into the Hudson River,"" she told an operator. ""A US Air big DC-9 or -10 has crashed into the Hudson River. ... Oh, my gosh!""

829,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- An autopsy on the body of actress Brittany Murphy was conducted Monday, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said. Authorities have said the 32-year-old appeared to have died Sunday of natural causes, and there was no sign of foul play or trauma. ""Naturally occurring diseases could be found in any person that could lead to death,"" said Capt. John Kades of the coroner's office. The office is looking into Murphy's medical history. A final report could take up to eight weeks. The cause of death will not be released until the toxicology report is concluded, said the coroner's office. That process can take weeks. Police also are conducting an investigation, which includes robbery and homicide detectives looking at what was in her home, said Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman Norma Eisenman. Murphy was pronounced dead at 10:04 a.m. PT (1:04 p.m. ET) Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, hospital spokeswoman Sally Stewart said. She is survived by her husband, British screenwriter Simon Monjack, whom she married in 2007. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show the leading cause of death for American women in Murphy's age range is unintentional injury. Malignant tumors are second, followed by heart disease and suicide. The often bubbly, free-spirited actress appeared in such films as ""Clueless,"" ""8 Mile,"" ""Don't Say a Word"" and ""Girl, Interrupted."" She also lent her voice to animated works, such as the movie ""Happy Feet"" -- in which she also sang -- and a regular role on the animated TV series ""King of the Hill."" ""The sudden loss of our beloved Brittany is a terrible tragedy,"" her family said in a statement issued by her publicist. ""She was our daughter, our wife, our love and a shining star. We ask you to respect our privacy at this time."" Funeral arrangements are pending, the family said. Fans have taken to Murphy's official Facebook page to issue their condolences. ""She was a great actress and was going to go far in her career! She will be greatly missed!"" read one post. Former boyfriend -- and ""Just Married"" co-star -- Ashton Kutcher was one of many celebrities to post his reaction to the news via Twitter. ""2day the world lost a little piece of sunshine. My deepest condolences go out 2 Brittany's family, her husband, & her amazing mother Sharon,"" Kutcher tweeted. ""see you on the other side kid,"" he added later. Singer-actress Jessica Simpson tweeted: ""Brittany Murphy was an incredible ray of Light to so many people. Her smile was contagious. My prayers are with her family and loved ones."" Actress Alyssa Milano, who did a USO tour with Murphy in 2003, wrote: ""She was a sweet soul, with a lot of talent and heart."" Murphy was best known for her work in a string of romantic comedies earlier this decade, including playing lead roles in ""Uptown Girls"" alongside fellow Georgia native Dakota Fanning, and ""Little Black Book"" with Holly Hunter and Kathy Bates, but her movie roles had declined in recent years. Last month, Murphy was reportedly fired from ""The Caller,"" a movie she was working on in Puerto Rico. Her representative issued a statement to news outlets disputing the report, saying, ""She was not nor has she ever been fired from any job big or small. ... [Due] to creative differences Ms. Murphy and the production mutually parted ways,"" according to People magazine. Murphy was the subject of tabloid gossip after she transformed from a pudgy brunette in 1995's ""Clueless"" to a petite, lithe blonde who graced the cover of such magazines as Cosmopolitan in 2005. She frequently denied rumors of an eating disorder and plastic surgery. Her love life also was fodder for gossip sites as she broke two engagements in 2004 and 2006, then married Monjack after four months of dating. ""All these ridiculous people came out and said all this nonsense when we got married, [but] thank God we had the substance and the history within that to [say], 'Yeah, whatever!'"" Monjack told People in 2008. ""We still don't understand what happened. It's made us laugh, it's made us cry, but it's made us stronger.""","NEW: An autopsy was conducted Monday on the body of Brittany Murphy .

830,"(CNN) -- At least 20 people were killed and six injured Wednesday in a mine explosion in northeastern Colombia near the border with Venezuela, the government-run Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining, known by the acronym Ingeominas, reported. ""At this time, personnel from Ingeominas are at the scene of the accident dealing with the emergency with a group of institute rescue workers aided by the 5th Brigade of the national army, who brought in a helicopter for possible rescue efforts and to transport the victims,"" the institute said in a written statement. Earlier, a spokeswoman for the national civil defense agency said that more miners could still be in the mine, although an exact number was unknown. Hellen Garcia said that authorities believe as many as 30 could have been affected by the explosion. Garcia said five injured people were taken to two hospitals, but one of them died. Four bodies were taken out of the mine, she said. The remaining miners are 1,200 meters, or almost 4,000 feet, below ground, and the rescue operation by civil defense, Red Cross and government crews was expected to last through Thursday, Garcia said. Yamile Rangel Calderon, mayor of the municipality of Sardinata, said the mine is known as La Preciosa, or The Precious One. ""This is one of the oldest mines in the region and one that has some of the best safety and quality controls,"" she said. ""They have been exporting coal for many years."" Calderon identified five of the miners who died as Manuel Aparicio, Gustavo Mendez, Gustavo Garcia, Jorge Luis Valdivieso and Nelson Velosa Fuentes. The blast happened around 7 a.m. in the district of San Roque, Alvaro Silva, a government official in Sardinata, told the government radio service. An accumulation of methane gas apparently caused the explosion, the governor of the Colombian state of North Santander told the radio service. A 2007 explosion in the same coal mine killed 31 people, Garcia said.

831,"(CNN) -- Authorities say they believe a young female who died after a shootout outside a Walmart store was connected to the shooting suspect. The female -- thought to be a teenager --- was one of two people killed in the Sunday afternoon shooting in Port Orchard, Washington. ""We don't think she was just a store patron unrelated to the incident. We believe she was associated with the suspect, but we have not been able establish the relationship yet,"" said Kitsap County Sheriff's Office spokesman Deputy Scott Wilson. The female remained unidentified. Two sheriff's deputies who were injured in the shooting were recovering from non-life-threatening injuries Sunday night. The sheriff's office said in a statement Monday that both were in satisfactory condition at a hospital. ""They both are going to live,"" Wilson said. Three sheriff's deputies responded to the Walmart store Sunday after getting a call about a suspicious person ""from a bystander who had concerns about a person inside the store,"" Wilson said. Officers responded about 3 p.m. Sunday, the sheriff's office said. The deputies approached one man outside the store's south entrance, but the man ran from the scene. ""(The deputies) called to him and said, 'Hey, we need to talk to you,'"" Wilson said. ""He turned around and shot at them."" The Monday statement said, ""For reasons not yet known, the suspect turned and fired multiple shots at the two pursuing deputies with a semi-automatic handgun. Both deputies were struck by the suspect's bullets and unable to return gunfire."" However, a third sheriff's deputy approached from behind the store, rounded the corner and shot the suspect, the statement said. The man was shot and later pronounced dead in the Walmart parking lot. Authorities Monday did not release his name, age or other details about him, saying they were in the process of confirming his identity and notifying his relatives. The female, who was fatally wounded, ""was in close proximity to the gunman at the time of the shootings,"" the statement said. ""Based on witness statements and other evidence, investigators believe that the gunman and the young woman were together and knew each other. However, their exact relationship has not yet been established. Also unclear is how the girl was struck by gunfire."" She was transported to a hospital and pronounced dead, authorities said. The process of identifying her was under way Monday as well. Wilson described the situation as ""somewhat chaotic"" but ""stabilized."" ""There is no danger to the community at this point,"" he said. ""We think that all persons (who were) involved ... have been accounted for."" The Washington State Police were taking over as the lead investigative agency in the case, and the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office requested assistance from the FBI. The female sheriff's deputy who shot the suspect was placed on administrative assignment -- a routine step in officer-involved shootings -- pending an investigation. The incident occurred near one of the retail giant's stores in Port Orchard, a town just west of Parkwood. Located on Sinclair Inlet, Port Orchard is about 30 miles north-northwest of Tacoma and across Puget Sound from Seattle. The store was locked down for about 20 minutes immediately after the shooting with and had about 100 people inside, Walmart customer Mike Lambert told CNN affiliate KIRO. CNN's Rick Martin and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","2 people are shot dead in a Walmart parking lot in Port Orchard, Washington .

832,"(CNN) -- The cost of repairing flood damage in Australia will top AUS $5.6 billion (US $5.58 billion), according to Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who proposed a one-year tax to help fund the reconstruction. ""The great floods of this summer have been a national tragedy, not just a natural disaster, because of the awful loss of human life,"" Gillard said Thursday. ""The great floods of this summer have destroyed billions of dollars of wealth and robbed us of billions of dollars of income. In time they may prove to be the most expensive disaster in Australian history."" Gillard said the money will come from $2.8 billion (US $2.79 billion) in spending cuts, $1 billion (US $995.6 million) in delayed infrastructure projects and $1.8 billion (US $1.79 billion) raised through a progressive, one-year income tax on people earning more than $50,000. ""The levy will apply only in the 2011-12 financial year ..."" Gillard said. ""People who were affected by the floods will not pay this levy."" Flooding in Australia, primarily in the state of Queensland, has affected more than 3 million people, making it one of the most costly disasters in the nation, the federal treasurer said over the weekend. The cost of the damage surpasses past tragedies like major bushfires two years ago and floods in the 1970s, Treasurer Wayne Swan said. The floods have devastated crops, tourism, retail and manufacturing, and have disrupted major urban areas like Brisbane, according to Swan. ""One of the biggest casualties is likely to be our coal exports, with many mines shut down in big coal mining regions like the Bowen Basin, and supply chains severely hampered,"" Swan said. ""While this will be partly offset by higher prices, the loss of production will be hit much harder."" Swan said the government has already made about $227 million in disaster recovery payments to people who have been affected by the floods.","Money to pay for flood damage will come from spending cuts, delayed spending and a tax .
Tax would raise $1.8 billion and would be levied for a year .
More than 3 million people have been affected by recent floods .

833,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suicide attack at the offices of the World Food Program in Islamabad killed five employees and wounded several others Monday, an agency official said. Pakistani police commandos stand in front of a U.N. office after a suicide blast in Islamabad on Monday. Four Pakistanis and an Iraqi national died at the U.N. humanitarian agency, according to authorities. The suicide bomber, who also died in the attack, was in his 20s and wore a vest containing about 15 pounds (7 kg) of explosives, said Ben Yamin, a senior Pakistani police official. The explosion took place in a storage area at the offices. It was not immediately known how the bomber gained access. ""The World Food Program's offices here in Islamabad are in a very sensitive and fortified area,"" CNN's Reza Sayah reported.  Watch witnesses describe the attack » . ""The building itself is surrounded by massive blast-proof walls and, not only does the compound have a gated entrance, the street that leads to the compound is also gated."" Pakistani Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi said public opinion is turning against the attackers. ""Today when people see that there are innocent people dying, when they see all the major urban centers of Pakistan being hit, when they see that the economy of Pakistan has suffered, and job creation and investment have been compromised because of these extremists, I think the public opinion has changed,"" he said in a speech at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston, Texas. ""There is almost a consensus in Pakistan that our immediate priority is to take the terrorists on and to fight this."" The neighborhood is home to at least one other U.N. office, as well as the residence of Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari.

834,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A meningitis outbreak is threatening the lives of tens of thousands of people in Darfur, according to an aid agency expelled from the country last week. A Doctors without Borders medic helps a sick child in a Darfur refugee camp. Humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), says it was preparing to vaccinate around 100,000 people in southern and western Darfur against meningitis, when it was told to leave the country. ""We were in the process of organizing a vaccination campaign. At the moment  there's no one there that can take over those activities, which is really worrying,"" Gemma Davies of MSF told CNN. The country's Ministry of Health officially declared a meningitis outbreak on March 2 at the Kalma Camp, which shelters more than 90,000 refugees in southern Darfur. ""Living in such close proximity, the potential for this outbreak to spread quickly is quite high, Davies, MSF project coordinator for South Darfur, told CNN. ""With no health care providers to give vaccinations, and with no one to manage the meningitis cases when they come, it's really concerning,"" she added. The vaccination campaign was due to begin on March 7, but it is now unclear if or when it will resume, as reports of government harassment of aid workers continue. Davies told CNN she experienced no harassment, and said government officials had  been in contact with only the head of MSF's regional operations. ""We haven't actually been given any reason on why we were expelled,"" she said. ""We have absolutely no idea when we'll be able to return."" Doctors Without Borders was among 13 aid agencies, including Mercy Corps and the International Rescue Committee, that were ordered by the government to shut down their operations in Sudan last week. So far the agency has confirmed 32 meningitis cases and four deaths, and has seen dozens of other suspected cases. Thousands of unvaccinated refugees and villagers are now exposed to the airborne disease in densely populated camps and villages throughout Sudan. ""One of our priorities is to get another organization to take over our programs there,"" Davies added. The medical relief agency says it doubts though that other any other organizations have the capacity to deal with a meningitis epidemic. Davies also said she is worried about the cut-off of MSF's feeding and maternal delivery services: ""We had over 100 patients on our feeding program that now won't be receiving any follow up."" The decision by the Sudanese government to throw out the aid groups came a day after the International Criminal Court at The Hague issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. However, not all international aid organizations are affected. Others including World Vision international continues its work, which reaches approximately 500,000 internally displaced people in South Sudan. The U.N. has received reports that international staff members of five non-governmental organizations had been detained for up to four hours. Speaking on the phone from Nairobi, an aid worker, who asked not to be identified for fear of further harassment, told CNN that his colleagues who remained in Khartoum were being intimidated and threatened by government agents. In some cases Sudanese government representatives ""had started gathering banking details and confiscating computers, communications equipment and vehicles from the NGOs"", a U.N spokesman said at a news conference last week. Last week, the U.N. warned that the loss of  NGOs in Sudan would cause 1.1 million people to go without food aid and health care, and more than 1 million to have no access to water. Oxfam, whose work focuses on providing safe drinking water, was one of the aid groups who were told their registration to operate in Sudan was no longer valid. Ninety percent of their staff are Sudanese nationals, who mostly remain in country, unable to continue their relief work under threat of arrest. ""These agencies are vital implementation partners for the United Nations and account for at least half of the humanitarian capacity in Darfur,"" said Catherine Bragg, U.N. Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator at the news conference in New York.","Meningitis threatens hundreds of thousands of people in Darfur .

836,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- UK prosecutors may charge the parents of paralyzed rugby player Daniel James with helping their son end his life. James, center, traveled from the UK to Switzerland to commit suicide. He was 23. James, 23, from Sinton Green in western England was paralyzed from the chest down in March 2007 when a rugby scrum collapsed on top of him during match practice, dislocating his spine. Worcestershire Coroner's Service, which is conducing an inquest into the circumstances of his death, states on its Web site that James died on September 12 after he ""traveled to Switzerland with a view to ending his own life. He was admitted to a clinic where he died."" The inquest was adjourned on September 19 for reports. What do you think about assisted suicide? UK police said they questioned two people in a criminal investigation of the case. Prosecutors said Thursday they plan to review the police investigation before deciding whether to prosecute anyone. The case has renewed debate about assisted suicide in the UK, where those found guilty of helping someone kill themselves face up to 14 years in prison. Switzerland, along with Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, are the only European countries where authorities will not prosecute those who assist with suicide. Many in the UK have voiced support for Mark and Julie James, who flew to the Swiss clinic with their son.  Watch the debate on assisted suicide » . Mark Roebuck, uncle to Daniel, described the injury on a Web site for the Dan James Trust, which he set up to help his nephew's recovery. ""He dislocated his C6/C7 vertebrae, trapping his spinal cord and becoming a tetraplegic in a split second,"" Roebuck wrote. ""This means that Dan (had) lost the complete use of his body from the chest down."" James, regained some use of his fingers, Roebuck wrote, but that was the extent of his recovery. Roebuck wrote this month that his nephew had died in an assisted suicide. ""His death was an extremely sad loss,"" his parents said in a statement, ""but was no doubt a welcome relief from the prison he felt his body had become."" In a statement last week James' parents paid tribute to their son and said that he had attempted to kill himself several times already. They added that their son, ""an intelligent young man of sound mind,"" had never come to terms with his condition and was ""not prepared to live what he felt was a second-class existence"". Matt Hampson, an English rugby player who was also paralyzed from the neck down with an almost identical spinal injury in 2005, now runs a rugby Web site that supports a charity for children with spinal injuries. Hampson said he met with James briefly last year to share his experience of living with paralysis. But James' suicide, he says, was a personal choice that only James and his family can fully understand, adding: ""Who am I to judge what he did?"" ""You either get on with it or you die,"" added Hampson, who played for the England Under 21 team . ""I kind of see my role as getting on with my life to show people that, just because I've had this catastrophic injury, that doesn't mean I can't do things. I don't think my life is worse. It's a lot better in some ways."" Debbie Purdy, a 45-year-old who suffers from multiple sclerosis, says she wants the option of assisted suicide if her pain one day becomes intolerable. Purdy has a case before the High Court to clarify the law. ""I just want clarity so I know whether or not my husband Omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if I decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me,"" Purdy writes on the Web site for Dignity in Dying, a British group that advocates for ""patient choice at the end of life."" Dignity in Dying says the law in England and Wales is unclear regarding assisted suicide. Although no one has been prosecuted for accompanying a family member abroad for the procedure, the group says, some relatives have faced police questioning. ""I want to know what the law considers to be assisting a suicide,"" Purdy writes. ""Is Omar open to prosecution if he helps me into a taxi to the airport, or books my flights?""

837,"(CNN) -- John P. Wheeler III, a former Pentagon official and the first chairman of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, ""died as a result of blunt force trauma after being assaulted,"" the Delaware medical examiner's office said Friday. A toxicology analysis also was done during the autopsy, but the results were not released. Police are still trying to determine who committed the crime. ""We don't know, ultimately, who was responsible for his death,"" said Lt. Mark Farrall spokesman for the Newark, Delaware, Police Department. Wheeler's body was discovered New Year's Eve at Wilmington's Cherry Island landfill as a sanitation truck was unloading garbage it had picked up from metal trash bins in Newark. Police say Wheeler was last seen in Wilmington at 8:42 p.m. on December 30, captured by a surveillance camera. He appeared confused on video surveillance tape that showed him near the Nemours Building in Wilmington. ""We don't know how he got to Newark,"" said Farrall. ""We're still canvassing the area, conducting interviews, checking video surveillance."" A Wilmington parking lot attendant, Iman Goldsborough, noted Wheeler's strange appearance on December 29 when he stumbled into her garage. ""It striked me as being odd because he had one shoe in his hand and no coat on,"" said Goldsborough. Wheeler, 66, oversaw fundraising to construct the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He worked in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. From 2005 to 2008, he was a special assistant to the secretary of the Air Force. At the time of his death, Wheeler was working as a part-time consultant for the MITRE Corp., a not-for-profit organization that provides systems engineering, research and development and information technology support to the federal government.","Former Pentagon official died of blunt force trauma, according to autopsy .

838,"(CNN) -- A federal scuba-diving team conducting a training dive in a Miami canal last week made a grisly discovery -- a human skull, authorities said Tuesday. The team was conducting routine training January 5 in the Palmetto Bay area when a diver discovered the skull in about 15 to 20 feet of water, said Nicole Navas, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. An initial assessment by the Miami-Dade Police Department determined the skull probably belonged to a black male, 25 to 45 years old, Navas said. The time and cause of death could not immediately be determined. The Miami-Dade medical examiner's office took custody of the skull for investigation. A spokesman for the medical examiner said that in addition to looking for evidence of homicide, suicide, accidental death or natural death, his examiners also will consult with a local expert on Afro-Caribbean religions. ""Periodically, human skulls found in our jurisdiction are traced to Santeria or Palo Mayombe source,"" said spokesman Larry Cameron. Published accounts say adherents of those religions have disinterred remains for religious rituals, and Cameron said customs officials at airport ports of entry sometimes discover skulls being brought in for that purpose. ""In many of these cases identification is never made, and thus the skulls find a permanent home in our anthropology room,"" he said. But, he said, ""at this point we have not proceeded real far with our investigation,"" and no possibility has been eliminated. The discovery was disclosed Tuesday in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement news release summarizing the activities of the ICE Miami Tactical Dive Team, which assists in providing security on Florida waterways, aids in drug interdiction efforts and helps conduct underwater searches.","The skull was found during a training exercise in a Miami canal .

839,"(CNN) -- Occupants of three trucks were working together in northern Mexico trying to pull over a vehicle carrying an American missionary before one of them shot the woman in the head, police said Thursday. An autopsy detailed Thursday indicated that Nancy Davis, 59, died a day earlier from a single gunshot wound to the back of her head, according to a statement from Pharr, Texas, Police Chief Ruben Villescas, who is working with U.S. and Mexican authorities on the case. Earlier, police said that Davis and her husband were traveling in a truck on a Mexican highway near the city of San Fernando, Mexico, when they were confronted by gunmen in a black pickup. San Fernando is south of the border city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state. On Thursday, Villescas added that the husband -- identified as Sam Davis by family friends -- told authorities ""the men in the black truck were working with two light-colored trucks that paralleled them (and were) trying to pull them over,"" the Pharr police statement said. ""The gunmen were attempting to stop them and the victims accelerated in efforts of getting away from them,"" according to the earlier statement. ""At a certain point the gunmen discharged a weapon at the victim's vehicle and a bullet struck the victim Nancy Shuman Davis on the head."" While noting they have not established a motive in this shooting, police pointed to past reports of ""criminal organizations operating on Mexican roads ... targeting 4-door pickup trucks and ... SUVs."" Villescas said that authorities don't know which criminal group, if any, is responsible for Davis' murder. In Wednesday's incident, at least one other gunshot hit the victim's vehicle, which is now in the custody of Pharr police. After Davis was hit, her husband drove their truck ""at high rate of speed"" to the Pharr International Bridge, which crosses the Rio Grande. Nancy Davis was taken to a hospital in nearby McAllen, where she was pronounced dead about 90 minutes later. The Texas Department of Public Safety, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the FBI and U.S. Customs and Border Protection are also assisting, police said. The Mexican Interior Ministry said it, too, was investigating ""for the purpose of clarifying the facts and act accordingly to punish the person or persons responsible."" Merton Rundell, a professor in the missions department at Indiana's Union Bible College & Academy and a family friend, told CNN the couple had lived in Mexico since the 1970s and worked with the Gospel Proclaimers mission in Mexico. Maryanne Wheeler, another friend who worked with the Davises in the 1990s, said Nancy Davis' death was a great loss. ""They breathed Mexico,"" Wheeler said. ""That's their love. ""For 40 years she has gone around Mexico, trying to be there as a nurse, a friend, as a spiritual adviser and has loved them. They lost the best,"" she said. ""They had a petite lady who had the tenacity of a bulldog and was there for you."" Wheeler said the couple had been shot at before and knew the dangers of the border area.

840,"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- United States became the second country to offer emergency assistance to more than a million affected by flooding in Sri Lanka. U.S. ambassador to the country, Patricia A. Butenis, said in a statement that Washington was donating U.S. $300,000 to provide various goods and services to areas hardest-hit by the floods. She said the funds have provided boats to local government in the eastern district of Batticaloa. ""We are helping the government to identify families in need and make an accurate assessment of the situation,"" she said. On Friday, an Indian air force aircraft brought in 34 tons of relief supplies. They included food, medical supplies, clothing and sleeping gear. Another shipment will arrive on Monday, an Indian high commission official said. The Sri Lanka government has about $1.3 million of assistance funds so far for the flood victims. Though the rains have diminished or receded in most areas, disaster center officials in Colombo warned that the dangers were not yet over. The Sri Lanka branch of the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that floods and receding waters may unearth mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) "" and carry explosives from contaminated areas into areas thought to be safe."" Mine officials and local authorities have urged vigilance from residents and people working in affected areas. The army has also sent out instructions to their installations in affected areas to warn the public, Maj. Gen. Udaya Madawala said. The mines are remnants of a war between Sri Lankan security forces and the Tamil Tiger rebels. Sri Lankan troops defeated the rebels in May 2009. The OCHA report said that the worst affected districts were Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee in the eastern province. Initial estimates indicate that more than 250,000 acres of crop land and 200,000 acres of paddy have been severely damaged. OCHA warned that prices of rice and other commodities may increase as one of the most productive paddy areas of the country have been affected. The number of camps for displaced people has gone up to 600 camp, according to disaster officials.","U.S. one of two countries helping those affected by floods in Sri Lanka .

841,"(CNN) -- Most of the wintry precipitation had moved on by Monday night, but much of the South is likely to see white stuff on the ground until the weekend as an Arctic low slides in, bringing low temperatures in the teens and highs barely out of the 20s. And a snow storm surging over the Plains and into the Ohio Valley promises to merge with the Southeast storm Tuesday night and slam into the Mid-Atlantic Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. The storm brought treacherous travel conditions across the Southeast Monday, with schools and government offices shut down from Arkansas to the Atlantic. Those conditions aren't expected to change overnight as temperatures remain below freezing, making morning commutes on Tuesday no better. In Atlanta, airlines canceled hundreds of flights Monday -- and plan to cancel more on Tuesday. AirTran spokesman Christopher White said the airline would begin operation ""with a greatly reduced flight schedule"" and warned that flights heading to the Northeast would likely be affected at least through Wednesday. Delta, which canceled almost a third of its flights across the country Monday, said it planned at least 1,400 cancellations on Tuesday. Spokesman Anthony Black said the airline was keeping a close eye on the Northeast for late Tuesday and early Wednesday. Both airlines were offering one-time flight changes with no fees for a limited period. And if air travel was limited, road travel was nearly non-existent. Impassable roads were the norm across the region, although that didn't keep everyone at home -- particularly truckers trying to keep their schedules. And some of those truckers caused some of the problems. Monday night in Atlanta, jackknifed tractor-trailers had blocked the east side of Interstate 285, which encircles the city, from Interstate 75 on the south to Interstate 85 on the northeast. Another had been stuck on fabled Peachtree Street in the city's Midtown district for hours. Georgia emergency officials warned people to stay off the roads if at all possible from central Georgia north. Atlanta police were dealing with so many accidents that the department announced it would only work accidents with injuries and provided an online form for drivers to report others. In Alabama, traffic accidents claimed two lives, one in Lowndes County and the other in Tuscaloosa County. Parts of the northern part of the state got 6 inches to 10 inches of snow, according to state Emergency Management spokeswoman Yasmie Richardson, and three-fourths of the state received snow or ice. Mississippi emergency officials reported a single fatal traffic accident on Sunday as sleet began moving into the state. No part of Carolinas was unaffected by the snows and ice, particularly the mountainous west where snowfalls of up to 18 inches were reported. North Carolina and South Carolina both expected freezing rain and sleet into Tuesday morning. The Tennessee Department of Transportation reported extremely hazardous conditions in the mountainous east, but ice and snow was also causing problems in other parts of the state. The governors of Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina declared states of emergency. Double-digit snow depths were reported Monday in the Tennessee towns of Minor Hill (13 inches) and Lawrenceburg (11 inches), and in Oxford, Mississippi (10 inches). Other areas reporting heavy accumulations were Greenville, North Carolina (9 inches), Asheville, North Carolina (7 inches), and Huntsville, Alabama (7 inches). Canton, Georgia, and Greenville, South Carolina, each reported 6 inches. Reported power outages were relatively few early Monday. About 2,300 homes in Louisiana and 4,000 in Mississippi lost power, according to authorities in those states, and power had been restored to most of them. Nearly 2,000 Georgia customers were out of power, according Georgia Electric Membership Corp, and Georgia Power reported 3,000 customers out. But the snow brought out some revelers, too. In Kennesaw, northwest of Atlanta, Sarah DeRoch's daughter Gwyneth was bursting with anticipation of a whole day to play in the snow. ""She's been asking me every five minutes, 'Did they close the schools?'"" DeRoch said. In tiny Pine Lake, east of Atlanta, the city closed its steepest street to vehicular traffic -- but left it open for sledding. It drew dozens of kids (and adults) for a slippery ride down the street, a long trudge back up -- to an open fire pit, s'mores and hot chocolate. Most Atlanta students also will be staying home Tuesday, as well, as the major school districts announced closings will stretch into another day, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The situation was much the same in other metro areas along the storm's route: Most school districts near Birmingham, Alabama; Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina; and Charlotte, North Carolina, will be closed Tuesday, local media reported Monday. As the storm pressed farther to the northeast Monday, New Jersey and Delaware went under winter storm warnings, while winter storm watches were in place in much of the Northeastern seaboard and New England. The National Weather Service predicted 5 inches to 8 inches in the Philadelphia area, 4 inches or more in northern New Jersey and 2 to 6 inches in southern Delaware from Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday morning. In the Southeast, the National Weather Service expected a high approaching 40 on Tuesday -- but the Arctic front currently bringing snow into the Midwest would sink into the south, without the precipitation but with frigid temperatures. While the snowstorm was a headache to drivers and businesses, it proved to be a help to police in one Georgia town. Officers investigating a pre-dawn burglary at a liquor store in Dalton, Georgia, simply followed a set of tracks in the otherwise undisturbed snow from the store to a nearby apartment complex. There, after knocking on the door where the footprints led, they found a pair of teenagers along with a backpack full of liquor bottles carrying stickers that matched bottles in the burglarized store. Two young men were arrested and charged with burglary and criminal destruction of property. CNN's Holly Yan, Andy Rose, Nick Valencia, Cameron Tankersley and Brian Walker contributed to this report.","NEW: Overnight freeze will keep the Southeast stuck .

842,"(CNN) -- Snowstorms barreled across New England on Wednesday, canceling flights, closing schools and creating treacherous road conditions for weather-weary travelers. Massachusetts Gov. Duval Patrick declared a state of emergency, mobilizing 250 National Guardsmen as a precaution, as officials warned of blizzard conditions across the state and into southern New Hampshire. ""The wind is blowing very hard and that's what most unpleasant,"" said Brookline, Massachusetts, resident Bonnie Sashin. ""It's blowing ice into your face."" Forecasters said accumulation in scattered areas across Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont could reach between 25 and 34 inches, while most areas expected 8 to 16 inches of snow. Snowfall in the heaviest areas reached rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, according to the National Weather Service. Some residents in Brattleboro, Vermont, donned cross-country skis as they traveled down snow-jammed roads, while their neighbors heaved shovelfuls of snow out of driveways and sidewalks, said town resident Caleb Clark. More than 15,000 households were without power in Massachusetts, including thousands of customers in Plymouth County who were affected by a transmission-line outage, according to the National Grid utility company's website. The hardest-hit areas included Plymouth, Bristol, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk counties in Massachusetts, the utility company said. ""This is the second major storm we are battling in less than three weeks,"" said Christopher E. Root, National Grid senior vice president of electricity operations.  ""We ask that our customers bear with us and be patient as our crews work in challenging weather conditions to restore service as safely and quickly as possible."" Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said the city's snow emergency and parking ban will be lifted at 9 a.m. Thursday, but public schools will be closed as crews continue clearing roads. He urged citizens to use public transportation. Amtrak said it has suspended rail service between New York and Boston, and between Springfield, Massachusetts, and New Haven, Connecticut, due to severe weather and fallen trees, according to its website. Every state except Florida now has snow on the ground, including Hawaii, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. High winds hampered cleanup efforts across the region, particularly along the New England coast, forecasters predicted. A band of moderate to heavy snow is expected to continue to move north along the coast, with heavy precipitation leaving southern Maine by Wednesday night, officials said. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he lifted the ""weather emergency"" on Wednesday, as salting crews and snow plows finished clearing city streets. The mayor said that 30 vehicles had been towed as a result of the storm. That number is in stark contrast to the thousands of cars, buses and ambulances left stranded last month after cleanup crews struggled to plow streets days after the storm. Bloomberg -- who faced sharp criticism over the slow emergency response -- said New York was better equipped to tackle Wednesday's storm. More than 1,700 flights were canceled at the New York area's three major airports, while hundreds more were grounded at Boston's Logan International Airport, officials said. General manager at LaGuardia Airport Thomas Bosco said many airlines pre-emptively canceled flights ahead of the weather Wednesday to avoid massive delays that plagued airports during last month's holiday blizzard. Philadelphia declared a snow emergency Tuesday night, while public schools there and in Boston were closed. Non-emergency state employees did not have to report to work Wednesday, according to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. But New York City public schools remained open, with field trips canceled, according to the office of the city's schools chancellor. The city's public schools have closed six times -- for a total of eight days -- since 1978, the office said. In the South, normally bustling cities such as Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, grappled with the unusual onslaught of ice and snow this week. AirTran Airways spokesman Christopher White said the airline is in ""full recovery mode"" to get traffic back to normal in the coming days at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The company canceled more than 90 Wednesday flights, after more than 260 flights were taken off the schedule Tuesday. Both Delta Air Lines and AirTran were offering one-time flight changes with no fees for a limited period. Delta canceled 1,200 flights Wednesday and has canceled 80 for Thursday because of snow in the Northeast. The airline said its Atlanta operations have returned to normal.

843,"New York (CNN) -- With memories of a monster Christmas blizzard still fresh, another blast of winter weather charged across eastern states Friday, with winter advisories issued as far south as middle Georgia. A large complex winter system stretched across the Northeast Friday, making for messy commutes in cities like Philadelphia, but bringing fewer inches of accumulation than the massive storm that paralyzed much of New York less than two weeks ago. By Friday afternoon, 391 flights at New York's three major airports had been canceled as a result of snow, according to spokesman Steve Coleman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. ""Overall we're talking less than 10 percent of the normal traffic,"" Coleman said. ""Most of these flights were canceled before the snow even really started."" Twenty flights at Philadelphia International Airport also were canceled as the storm rolled through the region, causing minor delays at Logan International Airport in Boston, officials said. Several major airlines -- including American, United/Continental, U.S. Airways and Delta -- announced that their customers could voluntarily reschedule flights to and from snow-affected areas without penalty. Southwest Airlines expanded the option for passengers flying in and out of not just New York and Pennsylvania airports but also Washington Dulles and Baltimore/Washington airports. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings, watches and advisories for portions of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Vermont for Friday. Separate alerts also were issued for parts of Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina. Forecasters projected between 2 and 4 inches of snow across the greater New York City area, with heavier amounts expected over eastern sections of Long Island. Snow was predicted later in the weekend for Atlanta and areas even farther south. ""I spoke to a couple of folks and they're just worried about the cleanup work afterwards,"" said New York resident . Hoyman Leung. ""The last round, they were certainly deficient."" Emergency workers, criticized for their slow response to the blizzard two weeks ago, will get another chance to prove themselves. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said New York has already instituted a series of changes. The heavy snow over the Christmas weekend hampered morning commuters, delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours, officials said. Following sharp criticism of the city's slow response, John Doherty, the chief of the sanitation department, has made management and personnel shake-ups in Brooklyn. An investigation is currently under way into whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed cleanup efforts over frustrations about demotions and citywide budget cuts. Bloomberg also announced that a handful of the city's 1,700 snow plows will be fitted with global positioning systems in a pilot program meant to better track the vehicles. ""It gives us the ability to check on the location and progress of our snow plows,"" Bloomberg told reporters, saying that the devices will be added to some trucks in New York's Brooklyn and one station in Queens, where many residents were left snowbound by the previous storm. The city is also deploying scout teams to transmit video images of neighborhoods back to City Hall during cleanup efforts, the mayor said.","NEW: 391 flights are canceled at New York's three major airports .

844,"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Air pollution at or near record levels in Hong Kong on Monday was caused by a sandstorm from northern China, environmental officials said.

845,"(CNN) -- Spanish driver Nani Roma upstaged the pre-race favorites to set the early pace at the Dakar Rally in Argentina on Saturday. The day was marred by the death of a spectator who, along with other spectators, was struck during the race's first stage. The others were being treated for ""slight injuries,"" according to a statement by race organizers on the event's Web site. The incident involved German driver Mirco Schultis and Czech partner Ulrich Leardi, the organizers said. Read more about spectator fatality at Dakar Rally . Roma, who was 10th overall last year after being hit with a late time penalty, was the leading car driver in the first stage from Colon to Cordoba. The 37-year-old, who won the motorbike class in 2004, was two minutes and seven seconds ahead of compatriot and two-time world rally champion Carlos Sainz in a Volkswagen. Roma's BMW team-mate Stephane Peterhansel, a total nine-time winner of the endurance event in the car and bikes categories, was a further 43 seconds adrift following the 199-kilometer stage. Defending car champion Giniel De Villiers was four minutes and 31 seconds adrift in a Volkswagen in fifth, behind teammate Nasser Al-Attiyah of Qatar, while NASCAR racer Robby Gordon was sixth in a Hummer. ""In the end we were quite surprised by the time we achieved,"" Roma told the race's official Web site. ""But I'm happy. We had a fright with the engine in the middle of the special stage and had to stop to make a few checks. But everything was running okay. I think it was an electrical problem, but since it was working, I preferred not to interfere with anything. ""It's only just the start. We haven't really had a battle with the VWs yet. There is still a lot of the race to go. In any case, it was a good special stage for warming up."" David Casteu also upset the favorites as he led the motorbike class by a small three-second margin from fellow Frenchman Cyril Despres, with defending champion Marc Coma 12 seconds back. Riding a 450cc machine in comparison to his rivals' 690cc KTM bikes, Casteu won a stage in the race for just the second time. ""I was riding at 150 kmph, but the bike held stable and is coping well. I hardly used any petrol. In fact, I had three times too much,"" he said. Poland's Rafal Sonik headed in the quad class, with fellow Yamaha rider Marcos Patronelli trailing him by one minute and 55 seconds. Russia's Vladimir Chagin led the truck category by 27 seconds from Ales Loprais of the Czech Republic. The 14-stage race finishes in the province of Buenos Aires on January 16, having also traveled into neighboring Chile. The event was staged in Africa and Europe until last year, having been canceled in 2008 due to security concerns.","NEW: Day was marred by death of spectator struck by a vehicle .

846,"(CNN) -- Massive flooding that has swept through Queensland, Australia, and claimed at least one life will likely force the evacuation of at least 1,000 people and close a regional airport for weeks, an emergency agency said Sunday. The flooding has directly impacted about 200,000 people, according to Emergency Management Queensland, and has affected an area roughly the size of the entire state of New South Wales. Rockhampton, Queensland, is the worst-hit major population center, the agency said. On Sunday, a spokesman for the agency said floodwater is receding in certain areas but is also flooding local towns as is recedes. He said electricity has been intentionally cut in areas of Queensland -- including parts of Rockhampton -- that have been inundated by flooding. Rockhampton's regional airport closed Saturday afternoon and is expected to remain closed for the coming weeks, Emergency Management Queensland said Sunday. Meanwhile, other modes of transportation in the area were essentially reduced to boat travel, as all roads, major highways and the railway leading in and out of the city were flooded. A 41-year-old Queensland woman is the first confirmed fatality of the flooding. The woman, whose name was not released, was traveling with eight family members from Mount Isa to Burketown when the family's vehicles were overrun by flood waters in the town of Floraville, Emergency Management Queensland said. After an air-and-boat search that lasted more than 12 hours, the woman's body was recovered around 10 a.m. Sunday, about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the causeway where she had disappeared, the agency said. All other members of the family were rescued safely. Towns across the northeastern state have been flooded since monsoon rains about a week ago caused rivers to spill their banks and reach record levels. Prime Minister Julia Gillard toured the devastation on Friday and said the flooding in Queensland will cost ""hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars."" Gillard traveled with Queensland Premier Anna Bligh through the sugar-producing town of Bundaberg, where flood waters reached 7.92 meters (26 feet) Thursday. Emergency Management Queensland said about 1,000 people are expected to be evacuated from their homes in the coming days. The agency said some residents were able to leave on their own and move to higher ground before the severe flooding, heeding warnings from authorities.

849,"(CNN) -- Victorious on the ground Sunday afternoon, the New York Jets got a special welcome home in the air Sunday night when the pilot of their large charter plane and air traffic controllers lined them up for a view of the Empire State Building, which was lit up for the occasion in the team colors -- green and white. As the plane approached Newark International Airport at around midnight Sunday, the crew of Continental Flight 1915 asked air traffic controllers if the building was still lit up. After confirming it was, a controller put the plane on a course down New York's Hudson River, telling the pilot they could see the west side of the skyscraper. ""We got 200 people looking at it,"" the crew of the Boeing 767 responded. ""Really pretty night for it, too."" ""I planned that,"" the air traffic controller deadpanned. A string of air traffic controllers -- neutral on most occasions, partisan on this one -- chimed in as the plane landed and taxied, proclaiming, ""Go Jets!"" The radio traffic was recorded and placed on LiveATC.net, a website for aviation hobbyists and devotees. The Jets beat the favored New England Patriots 28-21 Sunday in a National Football League playoff game, a result that evidently lightened the mood on board the Continental Boeing 767. ""You've got a happy bunch on board, huh?"" a controller says in the first transmission on the tape. ""Very happy,"" the pilot or first officer says. ""We have a question for you: Is the Empire State Building still lit up right now?... I've got an unusual request. If it's green and white, the guys actually want us to get as close as we can to see it."" After the pilot was given a heading that put the building within view, he said to the controller, ""You guys are awesome."" Asked later by another controller if they enjoyed the trip down the river, the flight crew responded: ""We did, and the team did too. It was great. I know the coach liked it."" A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, Paul Takemoto, said Tuesday the plane followed a normal course down the river, and the controllers did not divert from that course it to fulfill the players' wish.","The Empire State Building was lit up in green and white .

850,"(CNN)  -- An outbreak of the deadly ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo has prompted neighboring Angola to close its border with that country, Angola's state news agency reported Tuesday. Angolan Health Minister Jose Van-Dunem announced the ""suspension of migratory movements"" at the country's north-eastern border Sunday, the Angop news agency reported. The World Health Organization reports 41 suspected cases of the deadly fever in Congo since November 27. Thirteen people have died, and 183 cases are under observation. Two people are being held in quarantine. The handling of dead monkeys may be the source of the outbreak, the WHO suspects, according to Angop. Diosdado Nsue-Micawg, the WHO representative in the Angolan capital of Luanda, said the health agency does not know the source of the virus, but fears that hunters and women who visit the forest might have been in contact with infected monkeys. The outbreak is centered in the western Kassi province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been reporting intermittent cases of the disease since 1976, according to Angop.","Democratic Republic of Congo has reported intermittent cases of ebola since 1976 .

851,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Police have launched an investigation after a young disabled sportsman traveled to Switzerland to commit suicide, UK media report. Daniel James, who played rugby for England under-16s, was paralyzed during match practice last year. Daniel James, 23, from Sinton Green in western England was paralyzed from the chest down in March 2007 when a rugby scrum collapsed on top of him during match practice, dislocating his spine, the UK's Press Association has reported. Worcestershire Coroner's Service, which is conducing an inquest into the circumstances of his death, states on its Web site that James died on September 12 after he ""traveled to Switzerland with a view to ending his own life. He was admitted to a clinic where he died."" The inquest was adjourned on September 19 for reports. West Mercia police say that a man and a woman are helping the force with their enquiries. Assisting someone to commit suicide is illegal in the UK, as it is in most other European countries. What do you think of assisted suicide? James, who played rugby for England under-16s, was a university student at the time of his injury last year. He is believed to be the youngest person from the UK to have traveled to Switzerland to commit suicide. In a statement Friday, reported by PA, James' parents said that he had attempted to kill himself several times already.  Watch why James opted for suicide » . ""His death was an extremely sad loss for his family, friends and all those that care for him but no doubt a welcome relief from the 'prison' he felt his body had become and the day-to-day fear and loathing of his living existence, as a result of which he took his own life. ""This is the last way that the family wanted Dan's life to end but he was, as those who know him are aware, an intelligent, strong-willed and some say determined young man,"" PA reported James' parents as saying. ""The family suffered considerably over the last few months and do wish to be left in peace to allow them to grieve appropriately."" James' parents added that their son, ""an intelligent young man of sound mind,"" had never come to terms with his condition and was ""not prepared to live what he felt was a second-class existence"". Adrian Harling, the family solicitor, would not comment on the investigation, PA reported. More than 100 people from the UK who have committed suicide in Switzerland have traveled to the Dignitas Clinic in Forch. It is not known if James attended the clinic. Switzerland, along with Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, are the only European countries where authorities will not prosecute those who assist with suicide.","Young rugby player, paralyzed after accident, commits suicide in Switzerland .

852,"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- A powerful bomb exploded on a passenger bus Tuesday afternoon in Manila's financial district, killing four people and injuring 15 others, police said. ""It's a huge explosion; it's so huge that it created a hole at the side of bus where it is presumed that the bomb was placed,""  said Makati Police Chief Froilan Bonifacio. Bonifacio said the explosion occurred around 2 p.m. The bus, owned by Newman Bus Lines, was approaching a Metro Rail Transit station on Buendia Avenue in Makati City, Manila's financial district, when it blew up. The area has been placed on high alert, according to Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay Jr., who arrived on the scene a short time after the blast. He said most of the victims were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. ""We are still trying to determine what kind of bomb was used,"" Bonifacio said. An initial investigation showed the explosive device could have been placed under a seat on the bus, he said. Journalists Arlene Espirtu and Winona Cueva contributed to this report.","A police chief says the bomb might have been planted under a seat .

853,"(CNN) -- An electrical fire on board a Boeing Dreamliner caused the plane to lose primary electrical power during a test  flight Tuesday, the company said. The crew relied upon backup systems to land the  aircraft. ""The pilots executed a safe  landing and at all times had positive control of the airplane and all of the  information necessary to perform that safe landing,"" Boeing spokeswoman  Lori Gunter said Wednesday. Boeing is analyzing flight data  from the plane, a process it says will take several days, to determine the  exact cause of the fire. The company's initial inspection of the aircraft indicated damage to a  power control panel in the rear of the  aircraft. Boeing employees were conducting a test of a system designed to prevent fires  when smoke began filling the back of the cabin of the next-generation 787  Dreamliner, according to the company. The crew was testing a ""nitrogen generation system,"" which separates nitrogen from ambient air and pumps it into  fuel tanks as jet fuel is burned during a flight, Boeing said. The system is designed to prevent oxygen from filling the empty space and potentially igniting the fuel. There is no indication,  however, that Tuesday's fire was caused by the nitrogen generation  system, according to Boeing spokesman Jim Proulx. Boeing is grounding its entire fleet of test Dreamliners pending results of  its analysis of  hundreds of different data measurements to determine the cause  of the fire. The Dreamliner departed from Yuma, Arizona.  After about six hours of flight, smoke entered the cabin as the plane was on approach to Laredo,  Texas. ""It's something that needs to be taken very seriously,"" said Proulx. ""We need  to know what happened before we can determine the likelihood of its repeatability."" The 42 people aboard evacuated  using the plane's emergency slides, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Lynn Lunsford  said.  One person was injured during the  evacuation. ""We are continuing to gather data regarding this event,"" Gunter said in a statement. ""It's too early to tell what may have gone  wrong."" The plane is the second of six test Dreamliners, having undergone 179 flights and 558 hours of flight, according to Boeing  data posted on its website. The company does not intend to sell the test  plane to any airline customers. Boeing says it still intends to deliver the first 787-08 Dreamliner to ANA  Airlines in the middle of the first quarter of next year. ANA has 55 Dreamliners on order, which Boeing plans to deliver over  the course of several years. The Dreamliner is Boeing's new passenger jet, touted as a highly fuel-efficient aircraft made largely with  composite materials. It made its maiden flight in December 2009 after two years of delays, but the  head of Boeing's commercial aircraft division told CNN in July that the Dreamliner could still make its debut in early 2011. The company has nearly 900 orders for the jet around the world. Aviation experts say Boeing's testing problems are not indicative of the Dreamliner's ultimate safety. ""If I were a prospective passenger in a 787 I wouldn't be concerned,"" said  Snorri Gudmundsson, assistant professor of aerospace engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""All these bugs  will be weeded out."" ""Boeing is quite thorough, not just because of requirements from the FAA but  because of Boeing's position in the industry,"" added Todd Curtis, a former Boeing electrical engineer. CNN's Frances Causey and Jason Kessler contributed to this report.","NEW: An electrical fire cause the plane to lose power, Boeing says .

854,"(CNN) -- Eight people who died in a fire in an abandoned building in New Orleans, Louisiana, overnight are believed to have been in their late teens or early 20s, the city fire department said Tuesday. The victims, who were in a small warehouse in the Upper Ninth Ward, are believed to have been homeless and were burning a fire to stay warm, officials said. Two squatters tried to wake the others but had to eventually flee through a window in the tin building, authorities said. A fire department dispatcher said the call came in shortly before 2 a.m. Tuesday. ""The area is known to be frequented by transients,"" said fire department spokesman Capt. Edwin Holmes Jr. Those inside apparently were burning trash in a barrel, Holmes said. An investigator indicated the bottom of the barrel may have burned through, Holmes said. Authorities also found the remains of two dogs. Chief Charles Parent told CNN affiliate WDSU that the victims may have sough warmth inside the building as temperatures dipped below freezing in the area. A freeze warning was in effect for the region early Tuesday, WDSU reported. Holmes said that numerous phone calls Tuesday indicated that some of the victims may have been from out of town. The building is less than a mile from the French Quarter and was likely abandoned before Hurricane Katrina. Many of the victims may have known each other by nicknames, Holmes said. The area is known for panhandling, he said. Authorities were in the process of identifying the badly burned victims, who may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning or smoke inhalation, Holmes said.","NEW: Victims were in their late teens or early 20s .

855,"Washington (CNN) -- With its well-killing effort reported to be going ""extremely well,"" BP plans to start pouring concrete into the crippled well in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday. The U.S. official overseeing the response to the spill, retired Adm. Thad Allen, has given BP a green light to pour cement on top of the 2,300 barrels of heavy drilling mud already sent down the well. The mud drove oil back into the reservoir in an operation known as a ""static kill."" But Allen said BP should follow that with a second well-killing procedure that has been in the works as sort of an insurance policy -- pouring additional mud and cement through a relief well that's expected to be ready in mid-August. ""Based on the successful completion of the static kill procedure and a positive evaluation of the test results, I have authorized BP to cement its damaged well,"" Allen said Wednesday in a statement. ""I made it clear that implementation of this procedure shall in no way delay the completion of the relief well."" Earlier Wednesday, Senior Vice President Kent Wells reported that the initial step in the static kill had gone ""extremely well."" The company began pumping the mud Tuesday afternoon, and the operation continued for some eight hours. BP pumped mud into the well from a ship on the surface mostly at the rate of five barrels a minute. That eventually increased to 10 and then 15 barrels a minute near the end of the operation, according to Wells. ""Everything proceeded exactly as we expected it to,"" he said. The move essentially sealed the well, which had poured oil into the Gulf for nearly three months until a tight-fitting cap was placed on it in mid-July. Wednesday marked the 107th day since the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history began with the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon that sank the rig and killed 11 workers. The government estimates that nearly 5 million barrels of crude oil spilled into the Gulf. But Wells noted that it has been 20 days since the well was fitted with a tightly-fitting cap, which stopped the oil from flowing and made it possible to permanently seal the well through the operations now under way. ""It's getting very difficult to find any oil on the surface, but I want to emphasize that BP remains committed to getting this well permanently shut and cleaning up any pollution and restoring the Gulf Coast,"" Wells said. ""That was our commitment from the beginning, and we're just as committed to that today."" While it may be difficult to find much oil on the surface for skimming ships to collect, local officials are quick to point out that coastal areas are still being affected. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries issued a report Wednesday indicating that oil sheen and patches of oil are still being spotted in marshes and various coastal areas in St. Bernard, Paquemines and Jefferson parishes. And in another development Wednesday, Louisiana wildlife officials and the state's Special Investigations Unit said two men had been arrested and accused of falsifying documents to file claims with BP. Authorities said An Ly, 36, the owner of Ly Ly Seafood, and Samith Huynh, 31, falsified documents from January through April, reporting the sale of 6,347 pounds of crabs for $9,548.91 during that period -- in the months before the Deepwater Horizon explosion. According to the arrest warrant, Huynh acknowledged receiving $5,000 checks from BP America in May and June. But the warrant said that when confronted by authorities, both men admitted they did not sell or purchase any crabs in the months  leading up to the explosion, after it was pointed out that Huynh didn't have a commercial fishing license during that time -- and only obtained one in May. The men, from the town of New Iberia, Louisiana, southwest of Baton Rouge, were booked Tuesday in the East Baton Rouge Parish Jail. If convicted, they could face fines up to $5,000 and up to five years in jail. BP has promised to compensate people impacted by the spill, and In a meeting with President Barack Obama in June, BP executives agreed to set up a $20 billion dollar fund for that purpose. Meanwhile, Carol Browner, director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy, talked about the well-killing efforts on CNN's Situation Room. She told Wolf Blitzer, ""It's not mission accomplished, but obviously, it's an important day."" ""We know the static kill worked, and we know we're not going to have more oil leaking into the Gulf,"" she said. But she noted the relief well operation lies ahead, and said, ""We also have the long-term restoration. So we're just beginning one phase as we end one phase."" Looking ahead to that next phase, coastal parish leaders and state officials in Louisiana submitted a transition plan to the Coast Guard on long-range cleanup efforts. The plan was developed after a meeting last week with Gov. Bobby Jindal, coastal parish presidents, Coast Guard officials and BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles. The plan notes that federal, state and local authorities all must agree that shorelines are clean, before the effort will stop. On that cleanup front, a government report released Wednesday indicated that 74 percent of the oil that leaked from the well over nearly three months has been collected, has dispersed or has evaporated. Several agencies were involved in the study including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Department of the Interior. Of the total amount of oil that spilled in the Gulf of Mexico -- the most recent estimate is 205.8 million gallons -- just 26 percent remains in the water, either on or just below the surface as a light sheen and weathered tar balls. Of the remaining 26 percent, ""much of that is in the process of being degraded and cleaned up on the shore,"" said Jane Lubchenco, NOAA administrator. The tar balls are either washing ashore, being collected from the coastlines, or buried in sand and sediment and are in the process of being degraded, the report said. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: BP given green light to pour cement down well as part of ""static kill""

856,"(CNN) -- Classes resumed last Thursday at the University of Kansas at Lawrence, and by Monday 47 students had swine flu, a college official said. The CDC recommends someone sick with the virus remain out of class for 24 hours after fever has abated on its own. Although that's less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the 27,000-member student body, and no one has died or been hospitalized, the school has moved into action. ""The sanitizer's out,"" said Todd Cohen, director of university relations. The university sent e-mails to faculty members asking them to create contingency plans so that sick students are not required to go to class, and to commuter students and their parents warning them that the students may have to be isolated if they fall ill. That same message has gone to students in dormitories. Arrangements are being made to isolate anyone who's sick in their rooms by moving out their roommates and dropping off meals, Cohen said. None of the school's cases of swine flu -- also called H1N1 -- has proven fatal or resulted in a hospitalization, he said, and none of the reported cases has been confirmed. Public health officials are simply assuming that anyone with flu symptoms has swine flu, because it's the only form of the virus in circulation, he said. The school's health center can do little for those who show up for help. ""They're basically told to go home and rest and get better,"" Cohen said. Vaccines are unlikely to help much this year. Supplies are not expected until late October, and require some five weeks from the first inoculation -- two are required -- before they become effective. ""By then, it's December and the semester is almost over,"" he said. So public health officials are focusing on more basic medical efforts. Students already overloaded with information at the start of the semester are being urged to sneeze into their sleeves, wash their hands frequently and stay home if they get sick, Cohen said. ""It really comes down to them taking personal action,"" he said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends someone sick with the virus remain out of class for 24 hours after fever has abated on its own. Firm figures on just how many people have the illness are tough to come by. Doctors are not required to report it to state or federal health officials, said Maggie Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. ""We've stopped accepting tests from county health departments,"" she said. Instead, the department is focusing on a surveillance system that will test only those sites deemed representative. Otherwise, Thompson said, the state's laboratories would become overwhelmed. ""There are just too many numbers."" The state stopped counting laboratory-confirmed cases at 324: ""But that is just a fraction of what we think is going on,"" she said. ""There could be as many as 10,000 cases in Kansas already."" KU students are not the only ones catching swine flu, Thompson said: ""If you called any university of this size around the country it's probably going to be about the same."" At Auburn University in Alabama, 10 cases have been reported among the 24,000 students who started classes last Monday, a spokeswoman said. ""So far, everybody seems to be recovering,"" said Deedie Dowdle. The school's emergency management team was meeting this week to decide how to handle larger-scale absences, she said. ""I'm getting lots of reports of outbreaks in the Southeast Conference,"" said Dr. James Turner, president of the American College Health Association. ""I'm anticipating several thousand cases among college students this fall."" Among the preparations are plans for mass vaccinations, he said. But with school just beginning, much remains unknown, he said. ""We are just kind of hunkering down right now waiting to see where this goes."" Turner is also executive director for student health at the University of Virginia, where classes are slated to begin Tuesday. ""We're kind of bracing for what the week brings,"" he said. Turner said 63 students came down with swine flu during the summer session, and ""they all did fine."" Last week, the CDC released tips for school administrators to follow. ""We're hoping we're on track to be ahead of this virus, to get the college-age population vaccinated once it becomes available in mid-October, and to keep students as safe and secure as possible,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters in a conference call. Some U.S. colleges began reporting cases last April, after students returned from spring break. The University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, which reported one case of H1N1 last spring, is taking extra precautions ahead of the fall semester. ""We are attacking the disease, from each person taking the responsibility for good hygiene and healthy habits,"" said Ann Kleva, the university's director of health services. The University of California has been stocking up on supplies for each of its 10 campuses over the past several months, university system officials said. Since mid-April, when swine flu was discovered, the CDC has tallied 522 deaths in the nation. ""We do know that H1N1 flu is circulating in the country right now,"" said Lisa Barrios, of the agency's division of adolescent and school health. ""For the most part, it's sporadic and regional."" But she said the agency is not advising any schools to close. ""What we're doing is keeping a very close eye on what's happening with the flu during the fall and the winter,"" she said. The swine flu virus has captured the attention of public health experts because they worry it could mutate into a far more lethal form. ""If that does happen, then we may recommend that schools close, but right now we are not doing that,"" Barrios said. ""It's important to balance the risks with the benefits of keeping kids in schools.""

857,"(CNN) -- The people who died Thursday at a spiritual resort in Arizona had spent time in a ""sweatbox"" similar to what Native Americans and other cultures have used for prayer and purification rituals throughout history. Two people died and were 19 injured after spending up to two hours inside this ""sweatbox"" at an Arizona resort. And those who use them say they can be dangerous if care is not taken. From Scandinavia to South America to Africa, people have come together in the sauna-like structures -- typically heated by pouring water on hot lava rocks -- for a variety of reasons, said Joseph Bruchac, writer and author of The Native American Sweat Lodge. He's part Abenaki, a tribe concentrated in the northeast United Staes, and part European. ""Each tribal nation has its own traditions, so one group might do it differently from another so you cannot generalize too much,"" said Bruchac, who runs an outdoor education center in Greenfield Center, New York. In North America, most Native American tribes use the term ""sweat lodge"" to refer to a dome-shaped structure where the intimate ritual of the sweat takes place, said Bruchac, who has his own sweat lodge on his property in the foothills of the Adirondacks. ""Sweat lodges are typically used for a ritual preparation, like before a hunt, or nowadays, people might do it before a wedding or dance or some kind of community event as a way of putting yourself in balance,"" he said. Bruchac noted that incidents like the one in Arizona tend to raise discussion in Native American communities over whether non-Natives should be allowed to adapt traditional ceremonies. ""It's a very meaningful ceremony. I can understand why people find it attractive,"" Bruchac said. ""But I consider it sacrilegious and foolish to do someone else's rituals without proper guidance or practice, especially in sweat lodges where you're raising people's body temperatures. With that many people, oxygen is going to be depleted, and if you have heart problems or breathing problems, you could faint or die."" No information about the sweatbox at the Angel Valley Resort near Sedona could be found on the Web site Saturday. The two people who died and the 19 others who fell ill there were attending a program by self-help expert James Arthur Ray, authorities said Saturday. Authorities said between 50 and 60 people were in the structure for nearly two hours -- far exceeding the number who ordinarily would participate in a traditional sweat, according to Bruchac. In a typical ritual, the leader of the sweat gathers four to 12 friends, family members or guests inside the structure, usually made of willow and covered with blankets or canvas, he said. ""The person running the sweat has to be very aware of the people in the lodge because he takes control of them mentally, physically and spiritually,"" said Bruchac. ""The leader is responsible for them, so he has to be aware of their physical conditions and their motivations, their reasons for being there."" After everyone is inside, a firekeeper heats stones, usually lava rocks, and brings them into the lodge, placing them in a hole in the ground and carefully pouring water over the stones to release steam. The technique of releasing the heat is done with great care so that no one is injured by the steam, which can burn skin or lungs if someone inhales it, said Father Raymond Bucko, Director of Native Studies at Creighton University. ""Nobody will make it so hot that no one can stand it,"" said Bucko. ""Religious leaders are very careful about people's health in the sweat. If they're not healthy, people can sit outside the sweat and pray and others can go in for them."" A ritual of speaking or prayer may follow, depending on the group's intention for gathering. ""People talk and often there's lot of humor, but at any time if it's too hot, some one can say so and they will immediately open the door and people are encouraged to go out,"" he said. The Jesuit priest and cultural anthropologist participated in sweats with the Crow and Lakota people for nearly 30 years, until he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis two years ago. ""It's not about toughing it out or proving anything. It really is a beautiful experience of people coming together, of intense prayerfulness.""","Sweat lodges are used in prayer and purification rituals across globe .

858,"(CNN) -- If there's a blessing in the current swine flu epidemic, it's how benign the illness seems to be outside the central disease cluster in Mexico. But history offers a dark warning to anyone ready to write off the 2009 H1N1 virus. The Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 sickened an estimated third of the world's population. In each of the four major pandemics since 1889, a spring wave of relatively mild illness was followed by a second wave, a few months later, of a much more virulent disease. This was true in 1889, 1957, 1968 and in the catastrophic flu outbreak of 1918, which sickened an estimated third of the world's population and killed, conservatively, 50 million people. Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist at George Washington University, who has studied the course of prior pandemics in both the United States and her native Denmark, says, ""The good news from past pandemics, in several experiences, is that the majority of deaths have happened not in the first wave, but later."" Based on this, Simonsen suggests there may be time to develop an effective vaccine before a second, more virulent strain, begins to circulate. As swine flu -- also known as the 2009 version of the H1N1 flu strain -- spreads, Simonsen and other health experts are diving into the history books for clues about how the outbreak might unfold -- and, more importantly, how it might be contained. In fact, the official Pandemic Influenza Operation Plan, or O-Plan, of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is based in large part on a history lesson -- research organized by pediatrician and medical historian Dr. Howard Markel of the University of Michigan. Markel was tapped by the CDC to study what worked and what didn't during the 1918 flu disaster. Markel and colleagues examined 43 cities and found that so-called nonpharmaceutical interventions -- steps such as isolating patients and school closings -- were remarkably successful in tamping down the outbreak. ""They don't make the population immune, but they buy you time, either by preventing influenza from getting into the community or slowing down the spread,"" Markel said.  Explainer: Flu facts » . Markel describes a dramatic example in the mining town of Gunnison, Colorado. In 1918, town leaders built a veritable barricade, closing down the railroad station and blocking all roads into town. Four thousand townspeople lived on stockpiled supplies and food from hunting or fishing. For 3½ months, while influenza raged in nearly every city in America, Gunnison saw not a single case of flu -- not until the spring, when roads were reopened and a handful of residents fell sick.  Visit LIFE.com for photographs of the lethal flu pandemic of 1918 . Nonpharmaceutical interventions, or NPIs, also proved effective in big cities such as New York, according to Markel. In fact, the sooner cities moved to limit public gatherings or isolate patients, the less severe their experience tended to be -- as much as an eight- or ninefold difference in case and death rates, he says. Based on this guidance, the CDC preparedness plan devotes dozens of pages to potential NPIs, from voluntary isolation to reorganizing company work schedules to reduce the density of people sitting next to each other in the office or while riding trains and buses. If it seems odd to base medical strategy on 90-year-old newspapers, the approach is increasingly popular. ""There's a big case for looking at history,"" says Simonsen. ""We call it archaeo-epidemiology. You go to libraries and places like that, dig around, collaborate with people like John Barry and try to quantify what really worked.""  Map: where the flu is today » . Barry is the author of ""The Great Influenza,"" perhaps the signature history of the devastating 1918 pandemic. He says the historical record shows that isolating patients worked to slow the spread of flu in 1918, but that attempted quarantines -- preventing movement in and out of cities -- was ""worthless."" While Barry supports the CDC's general containment strategy, in the past he has publicly criticized Markel's work. After Markel's findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Barry wrote a letter in response, saying it wasn't swift action but rather an earlier wave of mild flu, acting like a vaccination, that was probably responsible for New York's relatively low caseload. In the letter, he noted, ""New York City Health Commissioner Royal Copeland did tell reporters ... that he would isolate and quarantine cases,"" but based on his own articles in the New York Medical Journal, he ""apparently never imposed those measures."" In response, Markel and CDC officials pointed to a decision by the New York Board of Health making influenza a reportable disease, and a 1918 JAMA article describing strict quarantine efforts in New York. Barry says both those sources rely on Copeland's assertions, which he considers unreliable. It looks superficially like an academic feud, but in this field, different conclusions can suggest radically different approaches to quashing a pandemic. Nowhere is this more true than in research that builds computer models to predict the spread of outbreaks, based on previous ones. Markel, along with most analysts, says that in prior pandemics, the so-called R-naught number -- the number of new infections caused by each infected person -- has been approximately 2.0. The current U.S. pandemic control strategy is based on computer simulations that assume a flu virus with an R-naught between 1.6 and 2.4. Last year, however, Simonsen and Viggo Andreasen concluded that the true R-naught of the 1918 flu virus was probably somewhere between 3 and 4. Since an epidemic grows exponentially -- each person sickens three others, each of whom infects three more, and so on -- this is a tremendous difference. ""It says it's going to be harder than we thought"" to control a pandemic, Simonsen says. Barry agrees. ""I do think that some of these things, like isolating [sick people], will take off some of the edge. We hope they'll do more than that. But to think they'll stop a pandemic, that is just not going to happen."" Simonsen says control measures such as the steps taken by Mexico in recent days -- closing schools and restaurants, for example -- are still worth the effort. ""It doesn't mean we should give up, because we don't know the R-naught [for swine flu]. We don't know how easily this spreads."" But she adds, NPIs are at best a way to buy time. ""We just badly need a vaccine. That's the most important thing."" To date, the CDC has emphasized personal protective steps such as washing hands and using hand gels, as opposed to tightening border controls or issuing formal directives to close schools or limit public gatherings. Such steps have been left to state and local officials, who have responded in a variety of ways. One reason for the delay in stronger guidelines is that swine flu caught planners off guard; they had anticipated being able to recognize a pandemic overseas, weeks or at least days before it hit the United States. At the same time, CDC acting director Dr. Richard Besser said Thursday that it's important to let officials tailor their response to local conditions. ""They can take the recommendations we're providing and apply them locally. [By doing that] we hope to learn and see what are the most effective control strategies."" Markel agrees that the best response depends on the particular situation. ""History is not predictive science. And the powers of public health officials [in 1918] were much greater. Another difference is that people's trust of doctors and government in 1918 was probably remarkably different.... But what I have found, studying epidemics, is that good planning and good relationships between local state and federal authorities, goes a long way.""","CDC's national pandemic strategy rooted in lessons of past epidemics .

859,"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- An investigation was under way aboard a cruise ship in Barcelona's port on Friday after 26-foot waves crashed into a cruise ship and killed two people off northeast Spain, officials said. ""We are extending all cooperation to all relevant authorities. The captain has been cooperating and is aboard the ship,"" said Michael Maratheftis, spokesman for the Greece-based Louis Cruise Lines. Its vessel the Louis Majesty suffered the casualties and damage on Wednesday. Two male passengers -- a German and an Italian -- were killed and 14 other people were injured. Maltese government officials arrived in Spain on Thursday to lead the investigation, because the Greece-based vessel flies a Maltese flag, a Spanish government spokeswoman said. ""It's a weather investigation,"" Maratheftis said, adding that the crew's actions after the three ""abnormal"" waves struck the ship were crucial in preventing further casualties or damage. The waves smashed five windows on deck five in public areas -- on the forward part, or bow, of the 14-deck ship. Two male passengers -- a German and an Italian -- were killed, Maratheftis said. Were you on the ship? Share your story with iReport . ""It was a shock. It was unexpected,"" Vito Sgobba, the cruise ship's hotel manager, told CNN in a phone interview from Barcelona. The first wave, Sgobba said, pushed down the ship's bow, and the second wave soon after struck the front of deck five. Sgobba was on an upper deck and quickly rushed to the scene with other crew members, who evacuated the injured to the ship's hospital. Several doctors and nurses traveling aboard as passengers also helped, he said. The two deceased apparently died at the scene, and did not make it to the ship's hospital, Sgobba said. The victims were a German man, 69, from North Rhine Westphalia, and an Italian man, 52, who was traveling with his family, their respective governments told CNN. Fourteen others were treated aboard the ship for light injuries, but were hospitalized as a precaution when the ship returned to Barcelona on Wednesday night, Maratheftis said. By Friday, only two of the injured remained hospitalized, and they were to be released over the weekend, Maratheftis said. The ship's owners on Thursday repatriated most of the 1,350 passengers from 27 nations -- including Americans, Dutch, Germans and Italians -- aboard flights from Barcelona. Only 200 passengers remained in Barcelona early Friday, for their convenience, Maratheftis said. Dutch passenger Tom Berg told CNN that he had been in the hardest-hit area of the ship just five minutes before the waves struck. ""All people crying from that side, because there was a lot of water. We felt the wind going through the boat. After a few minutes, the cry ... calling for a doctor and we realize it was more serious than we expected,"" Berg said at the Barcelona airport, while awaiting a flight. Another Dutch passenger, Elly Maat, said she was on deck six, one level above the worst damage. The second wave broke the ship's windows, and some passengers donned life vests, she said. ""A lot of people were very angry and children were crying,"" Maat said at the airport. The 580 crew members remain with the ship, which is under repair. The next scheduled cruise has been canceled, but plans are for the ship to sail from Barcelona to Genoa on March 10, and to resume its normal cruise operations from there on March 12, Maratheftis said. CNN's Al Goodman, Stephanie Halasz, Ben Brumfield and Chad Myers contributed to this report.","Cruise ship was hit by three ""abnormal"" waves, each about 26 feet (8 meters) high .

860,"(CNN) -- A large oil drilling platform is on its way to the Chilean mine where 33 trapped miners are awaiting rescue and is expected to arrive later Thursday or Friday, an engineer overseeing the drilling said. According to Andre Sougarret, the 42-truck convoy carrying the drill was in the area of Antofagasta, Chile, approximately 500 kilometers (311 miles) north of the San Jose mine. Other pieces of equipment will arrive from Puntarenas, Chile, and Bolivia, he said. The oil platform will be part of Plan C, the third operation to drill to reach the miners. Chilean mining officials have said they believe that drill will dig faster than the other drills currently at work. But they cautioned that the miners, trapped since August 5, still may not be rescued until December. Progress on the other two rescue operations was mixed, Sougarret said. The drill being used in Plan A -- a type usually used in mining operations -- reached a depth of 171 meters (187 yards) Thursday, 40 more meters (about 44 yards) since an update given by officials Wednesday. The Plan B drill, usually used to drill water bore holes, hit a snag at 268 meters (293 yards), Sougarret said, when it struck a reinforcement beam used in the mine's operations. The men have been trapped for 35 days now, 2,300 feet under the earth. When rescuers first found them, the miners told officials they had survived for more than 17 days by sharing a jar of peaches and small amounts of tuna and mackerel that were in their shelter. Officials were weighing how to best proceed after the problem with the Plan B drill but said the drill bit would have to be retrieved and replaced. ""It was totally destroyed,"" Sougarret explained. The Plan B device, which had been drilling for less time than Plan A's drill and had already surpassed its distance, also had a problem Wednesday with a cable malfunction. The drill is widening a hole already drilled into the mine. Sougarret said that once it begins drilling again, it could reach its target -- a workshop used by the miners -- within several days. Then a larger drill could be used until the hole is wide enough so that the miners can be hoisted out, one at a time, in a small cage. At Camp Hope, the tent camp set up by miners' families holding vigil, residents eagerly scanned the rocky horizon for any sign of the caravan bearing the Plan C drill. ""I wish it were here already,"" said Milton Alvalos, whose nephew is one of those trapped. As residents waited for the arrival of the newest weapon in the arsenal being used to rescue the miners, workers walked the route the convoy will take to make sure the heavy trucks will clear the winding road into camp. ""Just the logistics part is the tough part, getting the people and equipment to where you need it. We've got to figure out the route [and the] power lines,"" said Shaun Robstad, who was coordinating the equipment's arrival for Precision Drilling, a Canadian oil drilling company. ""We do this all the over the world,"" Robstad said, but always for oil, never before for trapped humans. ""This is a first.""","It's expected to arrive Thursday or Friday, an engineer overseeing the drilling said .

861,"Houston (CNN) -- In the days and weeks to come, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' recovery from a gunshot wound to the head will be a marathon, not a sprint, doctors say. Nearly three weeks after her brain injury, there are several acute medical issues to be concerned about, according to doctors not involved with her care. It could take months -- or longer -- for her to get back to where she was before the bullet ripped through her brain. One immediate worry is an infection in her brain, according to Dr. Greg Zorman, chief of neurosurgery at Memorial Healthcare System in southern Florida. ""With gunshot wounds to the head, an infection can still happen, even this late,"" Zorman said. The other concern is the buildup of fluid in the brain. Giffords had hydrocephalus after she was shot, a condition where an excess of cerebral-spinal fluid puts pressure on the brain. Surgeons in Arizona implanted a drain to get rid of the fluid, and on Monday, Dr. Dong Kim, Giffords' neurosurgeon in Houston, removed the drain, saying she no longer needed it. Zorman said doctors will be monitoring Giffords closely to make sure the excess fluid doesn't return. Giffords on Wednesday moved from the intensive care unit to the Institute for Rehabilitation and Research (TIRR) at Memorial Hermann in Houston, where she'll undergo physical, occupational and speech therapy to try to get her brain back to where it once was. Her doctors there are optimistic. ""It's only been a few weeks since this happened and she has been tolerating our aggressive therapy program,"" Dr. Gerard Francisco, chief medical officer at TIRR Memorial Herman, told CNN's ""American Morning."" That program began as soon as Giffords arrived in Houston after being transferred from Tucson, Arizona's University Medical Center, he said, and has been upgraded. Neurosurgeons on Giffords' team describe the brain fluid situation as ""stable,"" Francisco said, ""but we're going to monitor that."" ""Neural recovery is a hurry up and wait situation,"" Zorman said. ""Recovering from that injury just takes time."" One of the first things doctors will do is try to get Giffords back to a regular schedule, said Dr. Alan Novick, medical director of rehabilitation for Memorial Healthcare System. ""In the intensive care unit, patients get their days and nights mixed up."" Rehab doctors will give Giffords a series of tests to assess her physical and cognitive abilities, he said. For example, they might ask her to draw a clock. ""It sounds simple, but sometimes they'll put in the wrong numbers, or put all the numbers on the right hand side,"" he explained. ""That shows us which part of the brain is having issues."" Another area doctors will look at is called ""executive function,"" or the ability to incorporate many different thoughts all at the same time. ""In our everyday lives, there are snippets of info coming in all at once, and we integrate multiple things that are going on at the same time,"" said Dr. Ross Zafonte, chairman of the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School. ""Obviously, she was really good at that, and hopefully she will be again,"" he said. With a brain injury, functioning may be impaired depending on what area of the brain was damaged, Francisco said. Doctors will watch Giffords' functioning closely and modify her therapy program ""to address individual impairments and deficits,"" he said. Still, Francisco said he continues to be surprised at the speed of Giffords' recovery. ""When I see her every day, there is something new,"" he said. That has been a challenge to her medical team, but provides them opportunities to challenge her as well, he said. Trying to become the person you once were can be very trying, doctors said. ""Emotionally, this kind of recovery can be very difficult,"" Zafonte said. ""Depression rates in this situation are well over 50%."" Some brain injuries affect not just a patient's emotional state, but their basic personality. ""They may have different behaviors,"" Novick said. ""Spouses and other family members have to relate to a person who was not necessarily the same person they knew before the injury."" All of this requires patience from the patients and their families. ""People like (Giffords) often have a rocky road,"" Zafonte said. ""But they often get to places that surprise us, and surprise them.""","NEW: Giffords' doctors say she is undergoing ""aggressive therapy""

862,"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Chilean officials said Thursday the first test of a rescue capsule designed to rescue 33 trapped miners was carried out successfully. ""We did a test with a capsule in a tube 12 meters long,"" said engineer Rene Aguilar. ""We were trying to see how the capsule functions in the tube -- the wheels, the springs -- and that works perfect."" Once one of the three drills working to reach the trapped miners breaks through, a rescue capsule will be lowered at least 600 meters (1,968 feet) to begin ferrying the men to the surface. Before the capsule goes down, though, officials said, metal casing or tubes would have to be lowered into the hole to provide a buffer between the capsule and rock. ""We will need to build a platform and bring heavy winches that can lift 400 tons,"" Aguilar said, ""You can imagine how big they are, we will need to position them. The casing could take take 48 hours to implement."" Interior Ministry adviser Cristian Barra said that by October 8, all the personnel and equipment rescuers need -- including two additional rescue capsules and a field hospital to immediately treat the miners -- will be on site. Officials said the tentative date they are setting for the rescue is the beginning of November but that they will be ready for a potential rescue as early as the end of next week. The Plan B drill continued to lead the efforts to free the men, reaching a depth of 333 meters (1,092 feet) on Thursday, the government's rescue coordinator Andre Sougarret said. The drill was taken offline for about six hours after it lost pressure while hammering at the tough Chilean rock, officials said. On Tuesday the Plan B drill passed the halfway point to the miners, spurring a celebration in Camp Hope, the makeshift tent village where many of the miners' family members anxiously wait. The Plan A drill -- a mining drill -- reached 148 meters (486 feet), but the hole it was drilling would still need to be widened to 70 centimeters (27.5 inches) to accommodate the rescue capsule. The Plan C drill -- an enormous oil drilling platform that dominates the rescue site -- had reached 156 meters (512 feet), Sougarret said. Sougarret said that officials were working with physicians and psychologists to determine the order in which miners would be pulled from the mine, but said no decision had been made. Meanwhile, the miners continued to aid with their own rescue by clearing rock that had fallen into the mine as a result of the drilling. The miners used front-loader machines that were not damaged in the collapse to clear the rubble. Officials said the miners were clearing about eight tons of rock every 12 hours to keep the mine shaft clear. Officials had no comment on a lawsuit filed Thursday by some of the miners' family members against the San Esteban Mining Co., which owns the mine, and the government for negligence. An attorney for 27 of the miners families filed the lawsuit, which seeks $12 million (U.S.) from the mine and government for harm inflicted on the men. Chilean government officials has criticized the mine for not having the right safety measures in place. Chilean President Sebastián Piñera dismissed several officials in charge of mine safety after the cave-in. ""Everyone who is here recognizes and appreciates the work being done by the rescue workers,"" said lawyer Edgardo Reinoso. ""This has nothing to do with one government or another but we have to ask why are these miners at the bottom of a mine?"" The mining company did not return calls seeking comment. San Esteban is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings and its assets are being sought by creditors. Government officials have also said the company will bear the cost of the army of rescue workers and drilling teams being flown in from around the world. At Camp Hope, several relatives said they had not participated in the action and the lawsuit was of of little interest to them. Said family member Maria Segovia: ""I just want to get my brother out.""

863,"(CNN) -- A researcher who warned of Hurricane Katrina's catastrophic damage sued Louisiana State University on Wednesday, accusing university officials of pushing him out of his job over his criticism of the Army Corps of Engineers. Ivor van Heerden led the investigation into the failure of the levee system surrounding New Orleans, which flooded when the levees failed during the 2005 storm. The inquiry put much of the blame for the disaster on the Corps, which his lawsuit called ""an important funding source"" for LSU. The suit accuses LSU of putting ""the bureaucratic interests of university officials above the health and safety of millions of people who live in the path of the hurricanes that threaten the Gulf Coast every year."" It argues that school officials ""engaged in illegal reprisal"" against van Heerden, the deputy director of LSU's Hurricane Center, because of his critical research and testimony about the levee system. Van Heerden was told in 2009 that his contract, which expires in May, would not be renewed. There was no immediate response from LSU officials to the complaint, which was filed in a state court in Baton Rouge on Wednesday. In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, LSU Chancellor Michael Martin said the decision not to renew van Heerden's job was made before Martin joined the university administration, but he said he had reviewed the issue ""and am confident that the process was handled appropriately."" ""LSU cannot comment on confidential personnel matters or on pending litigation, but I can tell you that LSU wholeheartedly supports its faculty and values their research, teaching and scholarly publishing,"" Martin said. ""LSU also values its role as the state's flagship university, and, as such, will continue its work to help preserve Louisiana's coastline, mitigate hurricane damage and search for ways to protect the state's coastal populations."" Katrina killed more than 1,800 people when it struck near the Louisiana-Mississippi state line in August 2005. Most of the dead were in or around New Orleans, where more than three-quarters of the city flooded. Van Heerden has said the university barred him from testifying as an expert witness in a case against the Corps of Engineers. But he served as an adviser to the plaintiffs in that suit, which resulted in a finding of negligence against the agency in November.","NEW: Chancellor says ""process was handled appropriately""

864,"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The body of a missing sailor was recovered in the wreckage of a South Korean ship that went down in the Yellow Sea in March, Yonhap news agency reported Saturday. The ship sank mysteriously in an incident that heightened tensions between North and South Korea. South Korea is investigating what caused the ship to sink and has not ruled out a theory that North Korea was involved, but Seoul has avoided directly blaming North Korea, which denied allegations it was responsible. South Korea's Yonhap reported Saturday that authorities have lifted the remaining half of the vessel, which could help aid the investigation. The 1,200-ton patrol ship Cheonan sank near the western sea border with North Korea on March 26. Forty of Cheonan's 104 crewmembers have now been confirmed dead, and six more are also believed dead, though they are still listed as missing. Fifty-eight crewmembers were rescued before the vessel sank.","Crews recover body of missing sailor from sunken South Korea ship .

865,"New York (CNN) -- Exposure to debris at Ground Zero may be linked to heart problems in police officers, according to a new study announced Saturday. The study revealed that police officers who worked at the World Trade Center site in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks had unusually high occurrences of abnormal left and right ventricular functioning, leading doctors to consider the role Ground Zero played in their diminished heart function. The study, which started in January 2008 and ended in June, was funded by the Fraternal Order of Police of New York State. The study was not intended at first to focus on the effects of Ground Zero, but rather to test the strains of the job, said Dr. Lori Croft, the study's lead investigator. Many Ground Zero workers have been reported to suffer from lung ailments after exposure to dust and debris at the site, but this is the first study that offers evidence that work at Ground Zero may lead to cardiovascular problems, said Croft of the Mount Sinai Medical Center. Once microscopic matter is inhaled, it can result in harmful scarring to the lungs and heart, said Croft. Croft said that a healthy person's heart muscle relaxes when it fills with blood. In the cases of the study participants, Croft said the heart remains somewhat stiff, which hinders blood flow and can lead to heart disease later in life. Croft tested about 1,200 police officers over an 18-month period and found that 53 percent had abnormal left ventricular functioning and 59 percent had problems with their right ventricle. This would come as little surprise if they were in their 80s, but the mean age in the group was 49, Croft said. ""If you're talking about 80-year-olds with these statistics, that's one thing,"" she said. ""But these are people in their 40s and 50s. That's unusual."" About 7 percent of 50-year-olds have this problem, Croft said. Croft said some questions remain. Law enforcement is generally a stressful occupation and police often work varying shifts and might sit in a patrol car for long periods -- all unhealthy for the heart, she said. The study, while revealing, needs to be further explored, she said. For example, testing police officers in other cities might help put the findings in context, she said.","Study finds unusually high occurrences of abnormal left and right ventricular functioning .

866,"L'AQUILA, Italy (CNN) -- The youngest hadn't lived half a year. The oldest had lived nearly a hundred. A rescue worker Friday kisses the coffin of a child killed by this week's earthquake in central Italy. The official government list of victims from this week's earthquake in central Italy reached 287 on Friday, as Italians held a mass state funeral to lay the victims to rest. They included Antonio Loavan Ghiroceanu, who was born December 11. He would have been  6 months old on Saturday. The oldest-known victim of the quake was Evandro Testa, 96, who was born in 1913. More than 200 caskets were lined up at the funeral, draped with flowers. At least one small white coffin belonging to a child sat atop a larger coffin, a baby's pastel outfit hanging off the side. The funeral was being held outside a hangar in Coppito, a town adjacent to the earthquake's epicenter of L'Aquila. Officials elected to hold the Mass in the open air to avoid the risk of injury from falling debris. Aftershocks continue to shake the region more than four days after the earthquake, and some were even felt during Friday's funeral. All of the area's cardinals and bishops, along with 100 priests, attended the special funeral Mass. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was also there, greeting and embracing some of the thousands of mourners before the service. Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone presided over the Mass as an envoy from Pope Benedict XVI, who plans to visit the region after Easter.  Watch Italy bury its dead » . Bertone said the funeral was a ""precious moment"" to understand the meaning of life and death. ""Everything can stop in a second -- projects, plans -- everything finishes. All that remains is love,"" he said. Watch more on funeral . Mourners, who were transported to the funeral on buses, dabbed their eyes and noses. Some stared at the ground or held each other. Few appeared focused on anything but remembering the victims. ""I feel rebirth in the heart, because below that rubble there is a will to rebuild, to start again, to plan and to dream,"" Bertone said, offering a message of hope. The towns of L'Aquila and the surrounding region, he said, ""will come back stronger, will have more courage and give life to these places with that power and strength and dignity of the soul that distinguishes them."" As well as sending Bertone to deliver his message, the pope sent holy oils to L'Aquila and a chalice with which to take Communion. Archbishop Giuseppe Molinari of L'Aquila also planned to deliver a message. The 6.3-magnitude quake Monday morning left about 30,000 people without their homes. Almost 20,000 of them are braving chilly nights in tents while about 11,000 others are staying in hotels, said Agostino Miozzo, a spokesman for the Italian Civil Protection Agency. Watch more on the aftermath . Recovering from such losses and rebuilding the city of L'Aquila will take several years, according to Miozzo. The medieval city is about 120 km (75 miles) northeast of Rome. Berlusconi has said rebuilding will cost several billion euros. Aftershocks have heightened anxiety in the area -- including a moderate 5.6 magnitude tremor that struck the area Tuesday. ""The mood is a little bit afraid,"" said Marco Volponi of the Civil Protection agency. He was working in a tent camp, housing people whose homes were inhabitable. In the nearby village of Onna, 40 people -- more than one out of every eight residents in the town of 300 -- were killed in the earthquake. On some streets, every single home was destroyed. Anna Rita Difilice lost her son, Fabio, 20, to the quake -- the deadliest to strike Italy in decades and the first major quake in the country in seven years. She said she doesn't know what comes next for her. Her village has become populated with tents, fold-up beds and feeding stations handing out food, water and other supplies for survivors. But she said she knew one thing: she's not going anywhere. ""My son died here,"" she said.

867,"(CNN) -- As the swine flu outbreak escalates across the globe, U.S. travelers returning from Mexico are wondering what to do when they come home. Travelers leaving a Mexican airport fill out questionnaires about their health. On Wednesday, Christine Kovar of San Francisco, California, returned from a vacation to Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico. She said she wasn't sure whether she should attend work or stay home. ""I feel fine,"" said Kovar. ""It will be the discretion of my boss whether I go back to work."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, is advising U.S. travelers back from Mexico with at least two of the swine flu symptoms to stay at home and avoid public places upon return. Symptoms of swine flu, also known as 2009 N1H1, can include a fever, sore throat, cough, chills, headaches and runny nose. People with symptoms should report to a health care provider or local health department and provide itinerary details and symptoms, according to the CDC. If infected, the swine flu is contagious for up to seven days. People who aren't sick should continue to work and use normal precautions like washing hands, according to the CDC. They should monitor their health for seven days. ""As long as they aren't presenting any flu-like symptoms, there is no reason why they can't continue to do things that they normally would,"" said Llelwyn Grant, a spokesman for the CDC. Meanwhile, the death toll from swine flu continues to climb. On Thursday, the World Health Organization reported 236 cases of swine flu worldwide. In the United States, the CDC said it confirmed 109 cases of swine flu, or 2009 H1N1, in 11 states, an increase of 18 from its previous total. On Wednesday, the WHO raised the pandemic threat level to 5 on a six-step scale . These numbers are causing alarm among the public, as schools and businesses try to contain the disease and protect the health of others. Some companies are erring on the side of safety, telling employees who returned from Mexico to stay at home for a few days. One university in Pennsylvania barred nearly two dozen students back from Mexico from attending graduation. More than 100 schools across the country have shut down. Greenville County School District in South Carolina shut down on Thursday to clean the buildings and busses when 18 students reported flu-like symptoms after a band trip to Disney World in Florida. School officials are awaiting the test results of the children. ""We are being proactive and trying to take [the] right precautions,"" said Oby Lyles, spokesman for the Greenville County School District. Several state health departments such as the New York, where there are 50 confirmed cases, and Kansas, where there are two confirmed cases, said they haven't made state-level advisories yet on whether travelers from Mexico who feel healthy should attend work or not. If travelers are feeling sick, the state departments said travelers should follow CDC guidelines and stay at home. ""If you aren't sick, make sure you are practicing the common sense precautions,"" said a spokesman at the New York State Department of Health. ""Wash your hands. Cover your mouth when you sneeze."" In addition to advising ill U.S. travelers returning from Mexico to stay confined, government officials are turning to the travel industry for help, particularly air travel. The CDC is advising airline crew members who have arrived from domestic and international areas affected by the swine flu to be on the lookout for ill passengers. Airlines have been advised to stock the planes with gloves and face masks in case of an emergency. The CDC said airline crew members need to ask passengers who appear sick to be quarantined at one of the CDC's 20 locations across the country. It's been smooth sailing at U.S. airports, several passengers say. There have been no nationwide questionnaires being issued at the airports, according to a spokeswoman at U.S. Customs and Border Protection yet. In contrast, at some Mexican airports, travelers are asked to fill out forms asking about his or her health, passengers interviewed say. Still, travelers will find warnings about swine flu all over the airport. At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, travel warnings about the flu are being distributed. Signs informing passengers about swine flu, particularly in the international terminal, are posted. As of Friday, the CDC was recommending U.S. travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Mexico.","Travelers with flu-like symptoms coming back from Mexico should stay at home .

868,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Aircraft manufacturer Airbus is ready to fund a third search of the Atlantic Ocean if a second search, now under way, fails to find debris from last month's Air France crash, the company said Friday. Investigators pore over wreckage of Air France flight 447 which crashed killing 228 people on June 1. Airbus is discussing a payment of between 12 to 20 million euros ($17-28 million) to help pay for a third search, but it is still too early to settle on a figure, company spokesman Stefan Schaffrath said. ""We are ready to give a significant share, whatever is needed,"" he told CNN. The company is driven by the desire to understand what caused the crash of Air France Flight 447 on June 1, he said. All 228 people aboard were killed. ""Our priority is increasing aviation safety,"" Schaffrath said. ""The aviation community can learn from an accident."" Airbus is already helping in the second search alongside Air France and the French accident investigations agency, the BEA. French investigators began the second phase of their search for remnants of the flight Thursday, weeks after the locator beacons of the plane's flight recorders would have stopped working. A ship arrived in the area of the Atlantic considered the most likely location of the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, according to the BEA. Using two submersible units and lateral scanning sonar, search teams will look for debris sites on the sea floor that could lead to finding the recorders, the BEA said. The locator beacons of flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders are designed to emit acoustic beacons, or ""pings,"" for 30 days after a crash. Flight 447 went down in stormy weather during a flight from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, France, on the first day of June. The search for the pings ended July 10. Investigators hope the recorders will help them determine the cause of the crash. Flight debris recovered so far is being stored in France, authorities have said.

869,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The death of a 14-year-old girl in England after she received a vaccination for Human Papilloma virus (HPV) has prompted a widespread freeze on the country's national vaccination program. Millions of girls have received vaccinations for HPV since 2008, the virus that causes 99 percent of cervical cancers. More than 1.4 million girls have received the vaccination in England since the National Health Service (NHS) started administering it in September 2008. Natalie Morton's sudden death Monday occurred within hours after she received a shot of the vaccine Cervarix at the NHS at her school in  Coventry. Three other girls at the Blue Coat Church of England school suffered mild symptoms of dizziness and nausea after receiving the vaccine, according to media reports. It remains unclear if the vaccine caused Morton's death. Only an autopsy will be able to determine the exactly cause of death. Glaxo Smith Kline, the manufacturer of Cervarix, issued a recall of the batch of vaccine used in Coventry as a ""precautionary measure.""  Watch reaction to Natalie Morton's death » . ""At this stage the cause of this tragic death is unknown,"" the company said in a statement posted on their Web site. ""Following immediate quarantine of the batch involved last night, we have taken the decision to voluntarily recall this batch as a further precautionary measure while the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Natalie's death is conducted."" On Tuesday several NHS clinics and schools indefinitely postponed immunizations. ""As a purely precautionary measure, we have asked the NHS to quarantine all stocks of HPV vaccine from the batch related to this case,"" a spokesperson for the NHS said. ""Where the local NHS has supplies of vaccine from other production batches, they should continue with the vaccination program."" Many clinics were forced to close as they checked the numbers on their batches of the vaccine. What is HPV? HPV stands for human Papilloma virus. Although there are more than 100 types of HPV, only a few of them are known to cause cervical cancer. Most strains of HPV are harmless or cause genital warts. HPV is a common sexually-transmitted disease. Almost half of all women who have sex will be infected at one point in their life, according to the British National Health Service. HPV infects the cells of the surface of the cervix. Infections can clear up on their own or stay for many years without any symptoms and develop into cervical cancer. Ninety-nine percent of cervical cancers are caused by HPV. What is the Cervarix HPV vaccine? The Cervarix HPV vaccine protects against the two strains of HPV (16 and 18) that cause cervical cancer in over 70 percent of women. The vaccine is typically injected in the upper arm, or thigh, in three doses within six months, and is recommended for teenage girls. How effective is the Cervarix vaccine? According to the manufacturer, Glaxo Smith Kline, Cervarix is over 99 percent effective. Is Cervarix the most common vaccine for HPV? No. Gardisil, manufactured by Merck is used by the majority of vaccine programs worldwide. Gardisil protects against four strains of HPV (16, 18, 6 and 11). Strains 6 and 11 cause less serious conditions, such as genital warts. Gardisil proved comparatively effective in trials carried out by Merck. Of 23 million American girls who have already been vaccinated, 32 deaths were reported, though the reports do not determine if the deaths were caused by the vaccine or just a coincidence. Why was Cervarix chosen for the UK? According to the NHS, Cervarix, ""was selected because the bid from this company scored higher than the competitor in the adjudication process against pre-agreed award criteria. The pre-agreed award criteria were shared with the manufacturers during the process so that they were fully informed of the criteria against which their bids would be evaluated."" When was the vaccine introduced? In September 2008, England began a national program to vaccinate girls aged 12-13, and a three-year catch up campaign offering the vaccine to 13-18 year old girls. Do condoms protect against HPV? Using condoms reduces the risk of HPV transmission, but infection is still possible because HPV can be spread by contact with parts of the body that the condom does not cover. What are the known dangers associated with taking the HPV vaccine? Cervarix has undergone rigorous safety testing as part of the licensing process required in the UK and other European countries, according to the NHS. The most commonly reported side effects are mild swelling or pain at the injection site, nausea, a mild temperature, dizziness, diarrhea and muscle aches. In rare cases allergic reactions in the form of skin rashes and in very rare cases anaphylactic shock has occurred.","Teenage girl dies after receiving Cervarix vaccination for HPV .

870,"(CNN) -- ""Sometimes you can forget about the preciousness of life,"" hospital spokesman Allen Poston thumbed onto his Blackberry after peering into an operating room where a team of 15 doctors and medical staff separated conjoined twins in six hours in surgery. Two-month-old twins Preslee and Kylee Wells required surgical separation. ""I'm standing here in the operating room looking at the exposed beating heart of Preslee Wells,"" he wrote as he walked the halls at the Children's Hospital of Oklahoma University Medical Center. On Monday afternoon, 2-month-old Preslee and her conjoined sister, Kylee, rolled onto their own backs for the first time, he said. Poston, who updated friends and relatives on the surgery with constant posts from his hospital blog, snapped photos of each girl and showed them to friends and family who had been in the hospital waiting room since early Monday. The news of the operation's success prompted a gush of emotion, breaking the silence that had once filled the room, Poston said. After two months of waiting, the two girls were surgically separated. ""We waited because we wanted the organs to get a little bigger, a little stronger,"" Poston had told CNN over the phone earlier Monday. ""The primary concern was cardiac connection."" After cardiac imaging, doctors determined there was ""very little [cardiac] connection,"" but they remained concerned about a ""liver bridge"" connecting the twins. That bridge, Poston said, posed the greatest operational risk because of its dual use by the twins. Born October 25 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Stevie Stewart and Kylie Wells, the twins are being monitored in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. They are listed in critical condition. ""Today, they leave the OR in two different cribs, one following the other, still close in proximity, but might as well have been a mile apart,"" Poston wrote. ""And that is exactly what everybody was hoping for.""","2-month-old Preslee and her conjoined sister, Kylee, were in surgery for 6 hours .

871,"(CNN) -- The death of Mark Madoff, the son of convicted Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff, was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner's officer on Sunday, a day after the victim's body was discovered hanging from a ceiling pipe in his SoHo apartment. Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner, said the autopsy was completed around 1 p.m. Sunday. Borakove said medical examiners will conduct toxicology and tissue tests on the body. The result, she said, will not be made public unless Madoff's next of kin asks for the case file. Madoff killed himself two years to the day after his father was arrested for swindling $50 billion from investors in the largest Ponzi-scheme in U.S. history. None of Madoff's immediate family members have commented on his death. However, the attorney who represents the victim's mother, Ruth, said she ""is heartbroken."" The attorney, Peter Chavkin, responded by e-mail and said Ruth Madoff would not provide additional information. Mark Madoff killed himself while his wife was out of town and his 2-year-old son was asleep in a nearby bedroom, early Saturday morning, authorities said. Madoff's body, fully clothed and hanging from a living room pipe, was discovered by his father-in-law around 7:30 a.m. The boy was not harmed. Mark Madoff's attorney, Martin Flumenbaum, on Saturday called his client's death. ""a terrible and unnecessary tragedy."" ""Mark was an innocent victim of his father's monstrous crime who succumbed to two years of unrelenting pressure from false accusations and innuendo,"" Flumenbaum said. ""We are all deeply saddened by this shocking turn of events."" Bernard Madoff is currently serving a 150-year prison sentence for masterminding the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. Madoff bilked investors out of $50 billion by masquerading his investment firm as legitimate when it was nothing more than a front. He used funds from new investors to send payments to his earlier investors, falsely portraying them as proceeds from investments, when they were actually stolen money, prosecutors said. The 71-year-old Madoff pleaded guilty to the charges in 2009 and is now incarcerated at the Butner Federal Correction Complex, a medium-security prison in eastern North Carolina. Bernard Madoff's criminal activities have spawned a tidal wave of civil actions against Mark Madoff, his mother, siblings and hundreds of other defendants, accused of profiting off the Ponzi scheme by withdrawing more money from Madoff's fund than they invested, money they presumably thought was investment income. A person familiar with the Madoffs says Mark Madoff has not been in touch with his extended family for the past two years. Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee in charge of recovering and distributing Madoff's assets, has filed a slew of lawsuits in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan over the past week on behalf of some of Madoff's victims. One filed on December 8 named Mark Madoff -- as well as his brother Andrew Madoff and uncle Peter Madoff -- as one of several defendants in a civil lawsuit. On Saturday, Picard issued a brief statement expressing his condolences. ""This is a tragic development, and my sympathy goes out to Mark Madoff's family,"" he said. The other defendants include JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, UBS, an Austrian banker, and two accountants who are accused of knowing about the fraud but covering it up and profiting from it. The majority of Madoff's victims did not invest directly in his firm. They invested in third-party feeder funds, and therefore don't qualify for the financial protections extended to direct investors. So far, 16,394 claims have been filed by investors who say they lost money. The majority of the claims -- 13,054, or nearly 80% of the total -- have been denied, because the investors were invested through feeder funds.

872,"Adults who were exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke during childhood have lungs that look different on CT scans from those of people who grew up in a smoke-free environment, a new study suggests. The harmful short-term effects of secondhand smoke are well known; the long-term consequences aren't as clear. Specifically, their lungs have slightly more, and larger, emphysema-like ""holes"" than those with less smoke exposure, says Gina Lovasi, M.P.H., Ph.D., of Columbia University, and her colleagues. Although breathing tests showed that the smoke-exposed lungs were functioning just fine, Lovasi said the changes could signal an increased vulnerability to developing emphysema and other lung problems down the road. Health.com: Should smoking around kids be illegal? Emphysema is a progressive lung disease characterized by shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and weight loss. About 24 million people in the United States have emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis, which together are known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however about half of those people don't realize they have COPD. The lung condition is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States, and smoking is a major cause of COPD. Health.com: I'm a nonsmoker, but I have emphysema due to a rare genetic condition . ""The interesting part about this is that we don't know a lot about how the lungs change over time and whether they heal completely after being exposed to tobacco,"" says Lovasi, who is scheduled to present her findings on Tuesday at the American Thoracic Society's 105th International Conference in San Diego. ""We can still see a difference even decades later."" The harmful short-term effects of breathing other people's cigarette smoke are well known, but the long-term consequences aren't as clear. To investigate, Lovasi and her team looked at CT scans of the lungs of 1,781 nonsmoking 45- to 84-year-olds taking part in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) trial. Health.com: 5 celebrities who had -- or are at risk of -- the lung disease COPD . About half of the study participants said that no one with whom they lived  during childhood smoked cigarettes at home, 31 percent lived with one person who smoked at home, and 17 percent lived with two or more smokers. Lovasi and her team checked the lung CT scans for large areas where the density was similar to air (lung tissue is naturally denser than air), and also calculated what percentage of their lungs was made up of these ""holes."" Health.com: My smoker's cough turned out to be emphysema . ""The lungs are supposed to have air in them, but it's important that the air is interspersed with blood vessels so that we can get the oxygen out of the air,"" she says. ""Small holes can expand over time and merge to form larger holes."" For people who hadn't grown up with smokers, 17 percent of their lung tissue had this air-like density, while ""holes"" made up 20 percent of the lung area of people who had lived with at least two smokers during childhood. The more heavily smoke-exposed study participants also had more relatively large holes in their lungs. In comparison, ""someone with emphysema would typically have between 30 percent and 60 percent of the lungs classified as air-like (or emphysema-like) using the threshold we used for our study,"" says Lovasi. Health.com: 1 in 3 smokers would kick habit to protect pet . Lovasi says she and her colleagues will be following the MESA participants over time to see how their lungs change, and whether people with more early smoke exposure are indeed more vulnerable to lung problems later on.

873,"About 1 in 7, or 13.5 percent of adults who encountered intense dust clouds after the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11 were later found to have asthma, compared with just 8.4 percent who had no dust cloud exposure, researchers in Atlanta and New York City reported on Tuesday. Among rescue workers, the asthma risk was highest for those who worked on the pile on September 11. Likewise, among various groups of people connected to the Twin Tower collapse, rescue and recovery workers were more likely to have a diagnosis of asthma (12.2 percent) than passers-by (8.4 percent). The results are from a survey, conducted from November 2006 through December 2007, to assess the health status of more than 46,000 adults five to six years after the disaster. Health.com: Bad air day? Here's how to survive . That such a horrific event left lasting physical and emotional scars is, perhaps, no great surprise. Among adults with no prior diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 23.8 percent have reported symptoms after September 11, and the prevalence of symptoms has increased over time, researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The mental health effects, which can be debilitating and often chronic, ""seem to be the largest health problem coming out of 9/11"" says Lorna Thorpe, Ph.D., the deputy commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Division of Epidemiology and one of the coauthors of the study. ""But immediately after the 9/11 event, I don't think there was a clear understanding of what the physical impacts would be."" Health.com: Is your child's asthma under control? Take this test . People in the vicinity of the collapse had ""the potential to inhale huge amounts of particulate matter,"" observes Joan Reibman, M.D., an associate professor of medicine and environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and the director of the school's Bellevue Asthma Center, who was not involved in the study. ""We think that could act as a real irritant to the airways."" Some 23 million Americans have asthma, a lung condition that causes airway swelling and inflammation. People with asthma may experience repeated bouts of coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and tightness in the chest. Anthony M. Szema, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine and surgery and the head of the allergy diagnostic unit at SUNY Stony Brook School of Medicine, has studied the effects of the World Trade Center collapse on children living in Manhattan's Chinatown. His team's most recent study, accepted for publication in Allergy & Asthma Proceedings, will show that the rate of asthma at the closest elementary school to the World Trade Center (29 percent) is high compared with the rate of asthma in children in the general population. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 9.3 percent of U.S. children have asthma. ""[The new study] is entirely congruous with our findings,"" he says. Health.com: As a new mom, I struggled with my daughter's chronic cough . The CDC's Robert M. Brackbill, Ph.D., M.P.H., led the team of New York City and Columbia University researchers whose study examined the longer-term health impact of exposure to Ground Zero and its varying effect across groups of people. The analysis is based on data from the World Trade Center Health Registry, described as the largest post-disaster-exposure registry in U.S. history. More than 71,000 rescue and recovery workers, lower Manhattan office workers, nearby residents, and passers-by enrolled in the registry. Participants were interviewed from September 2003 through November 2004 to record their exposure to the disaster and document their pre- and post-event health status, and again in 2006-2007. Health.com: Diabetes plus stress can equal high blood sugar . For each group followed, intense exposure to the dust plume was associated with new asthma diagnoses. Among rescue and recovery workers, for example, the asthma risk was highest for those who worked on the pile on September 11. The risk diminished with later start dates. However, even downtown office workers and lower Manhattan residents were affected. Among these people, the risk of asthma was highest if there was a heavy coating of dust in their home or office, compared with no such damage. ""It shows that people who had heavy dust exposure in the initial period, that this was a risk to developing asthma but not the only risk,"" says Reibman, who also serves as the director of New York City's World Trade Center Environmental Health Center, one of three centers dedicated to treating September 11-related conditions. Reibman says the new study is important because, in addition to corroborating previous studies, it should help people with September 11-related asthma realize that their symptoms are real.

874,"(Health.com) -- An antibiotic widely used to treat diarrhea in travelers may also provide some relief to people with the common and difficult-to-treat condition known as irritable bowel syndrome, according to a pair of new studies in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved the antibiotic, rifaximin, for use in IBS, which affects as many as 1 in 5 U.S. adults. The agency is currently reviewing the drug for that purpose and is expected to make a decision in March. In the studies, 1,200 IBS patients took rifaximin or a placebo pill three times a day for two weeks. Roughly 40 percent of the patients who took the antibiotic reported substantial relief from symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, and loose stools for at least two weeks during the subsequent month, compared with a little under one-third of the patients taking placebo. All of the patients in the studies had a form of IBS that does not involve constipation. Health.com: 12 surprising causes of constipation . ""It made all the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome better, which we don't see too often in studies,"" says the lead researcher, Mark Pimentel, M.D., a gastroenterologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, in Los Angeles. The studies were funded by the maker of rifaximin, Salix Pharmaceuticals, which was also involved in collecting and analyzing the data. (This arrangement isn't unusual in these types of studies, which are known as phase 3 trials and are generally the last research step in the FDA approval process.) In addition, Pimentel and several of his co-authors report financial relationships with Salix, including receiving consulting fees from the company. Health.com: Quick cures for stomach troubles . Rifaximin, sold under the brand name Xifaxan for travelers' diarrhea, appears to be safe and doesn't seem to foster resistance among gut bacteria, meaning it can be used over and over, Pimentel says. That could be important, because the number of study participants who reported lasting relief from their two-week rifaximin regimen gradually declined in the 10 weeks following treatment. Despite the relatively small percentage of patients who responded to the drug, doctors who have been frustrated by the lack of effective IBS treatments say they would welcome another option. Charlene Prather, M.D., a professor of internal medicine at Saint Louis University, in Missouri, says that while she'd hoped to see a ""more robust effect"" from rifaximin in the studies, she nevertheless would like the FDA to approve the drug for IBS. ""It still provides me with something I can offer my patients,"" says Prather, who was not involved in the new research. Health.com: 10 things that can make incontinence worse . Currently, ""there are no good options"" for treating IBS, says Timothy Pfanner, M.D., a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M Health Science Center, in Temple. Rifaximin may benefit a subgroup of patients with IBS, Pfanner says, although he stresses that most people in the study did not experience relief from their symptoms. ""As a doctor, I'd need to treat 10 patients for one to improve,"" he adds. Rifaximin would be the first antibiotic approved by the FDA for the treatment of IBS. Aside from providing evidence of the drug's effectiveness, the study findings -- especially with regard to bloating -- support the theory that bacteria may be partially responsible for IBS. Health.com: Alternative therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Bloating is sometimes thought to be related to bacterial imbalances in the gut, and antibiotics are a class of drugs that work only against bacteria. ""That suggests that we hit upon a cause of IBS,"" Pimentel says. This theory is still controversial. Prather says that while there is some evidence to suggest that bacteria plays a role in IBS, it's unclear whether changes in gut bacteria are a cause or an effect of the syndrome.

875,"(CNN) -- Authorities have shut down a Texas food processing plant, saying it was contaminated by bacteria linked to the deaths of four people, state health officials said. The Texas Department of State Health Services on Wednesday ordered Sangar Produce and Processing to immediately stop processing food and recall all products shipped from its San Antonio plant since January. This comes after state laboratory results showed Listeria monocytogenes, a bacteria that can cause severe illness, in chopped celery at the plant. Four people died after contracting listeriosis after consuming celery that had been processed at the Sangar plant, said Carrie Williams, a department spokeswoman. State health authorities came to this determination while investigating 10 cases in which people with serious underlying health problems contracted listeriosis over an 8-month period. Six of those cases -- in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo counties -- were linked to chopped celery processed at the SanGar plant, the state health services department said. Four of those people died, as did one other person who authorities believe got listeriosis from another source not connected with Sangar products. Sangar, however, sharply questioned the state's findings and strongly denied wrongdoing, saying it has had ""an excellent record of safety and health"" over the past three years. Its president said outside tests ""directly contradict"" the state's conclusion. ""The independent testing shows our produce to be absolutely safe, and we are aggressively fighting the state's erroneous findings,"" said Kenneth Sanquist, president of Sangar. State health inspectors said they believe the bacteria found in the chopped celery may have contaminated other products at the company's plant. Sangar processes a wide variety of products -- including three varieties of lettuce, peppers, carrots, cucumbers and various cut-up fruit, as well as salad, fruit and soup mixes, according to the company's website. They are distributed primarily in sealed packages to restaurants, hospitals, schools and other large institutions that serve food. Besides the bacteria, inspectors found a condensation leak above a food product area, dirt on a food-preparation table, and hand-washing problems at the San Antonio plant, the state health department said. The state said that it is contacting distributors, restaurants and others who may have received Sangar products. Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium found in the soil, in water, and in animals that carry it without showing signs they are sick, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can get into vegetables from soil or manure that is used as fertilizer. The strain of bacteria is relatively resilient -- with an incubation period of three to 70 days, Williams said -- and some foods can be contaminated after cooking but prior to packaging. The bacteria have been tied to listeriosis, which sickens about 2,500 Americans and contributes to the death of 500 people annually, the CDC reports. People with weakened immune systems, including newborns and the elderly, are especially susceptible to listeriosis. Pregnant women are about 20 times more likely than other adults to contract the disease. In August, Sanquist told CNN affiliate KENS5 that food-safety measures were not tough enough, saying the U.S. Food and Drug Administration should be more involved in inspections. At the time, the SanGar president said that his company had never had a high bacteria count or had anything recalled. ""Ultimately, you can get someone very sick,"" Sanquist told KENS5, criticizing city health inspections as insufficient. ""We're talking about fresh-cut fruits and vegetables that need to be sanitized."" The Texas health department is taking the lead in the investigation, with assistance from the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC. The state justified its closure of the Sangar plant, citing Texas law that authorizes such actions if conditions pose ""an immediate and serious threat to human life or health."" ""At this point, the order prohibits the plant from reopening without our approval,"" said Williams. ""We will work with the company about setting up some guidelines before it can [reopen].""","NEW: Four people died after eating celery processed at Sangar plant, officials say .

876,"(CNN) -- When Tiffany Wilson noticed a small growth on her left hip, she didn't think much of it. Tiffany Wilson, 41, found a bump on her hip that she thought was a pimple. It turned out to be skin cancer. ""It was bizarre,"" recalled the 41-year-old salon owner from Minneapolis, Minnesota. ""I just thought it was a pimple."" Wilson, who is African-American, can't say exactly what prompted her to point out the bump to her physician, but she said she remembered thinking the diagnosis wouldn't be anything serious. ""It never occurred to me that it was skin cancer,"" she said. But it was. She had basal cell carcinoma, the most common skin cancer. Wilson spent long hours as a child in the summer sun at Lake Nokomis in Minnesota and went to the tanning bed before visiting relatives in the Caribbean, she said. She also said she never wore sunscreen. ""Back then, I just don't think people were aware of the effects [of the sun],"" she said. Those may seem like obvious red flags to people who are sun-conscious, but they were foreign concepts to Wilson, which is why her diagnosis came as a shock. ""I just assumed, 'I'm a person of color, I'll be OK,' "" she said. Dermatologists say they are concerned because skin cancer rates are increasing among minority groups in the United States. Like Wilson, many people of color often mistakenly believe skin cancer is not something they should be worried about. Pigmentation is no 'free pass' The reasoning is not completely far-fetched: Darker-skinned people do benefit from the protective effects of skin pigmentation. In fact, some studies suggest that for the darkest skin tones, pigmentation cells provide a natural sun protection factor, or SPF, of about 13. The problem is many dark-skinned people believe that means they are born with a natural immunity to skin cancer. ""Pigmentation doesn't give you a free pass,"" said Dr. Charles E. Crutchfield III, a dermatologist specializing in ethnic skin and the doctor who treated Tiffany Wilson. ""It doesn't matter what color your skin is, everyone can get skin cancer."" Bob Marley, for example, died of malignant melanoma, the most lethal type of skin cancer, that spread to his lungs and brain. All types of skin cancer are increasing among blacks and Hispanics, and their melanomas are more often fatal because they are usually caught later, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Crutchfield pointed out that pigmentation may have sun-protective qualities but even for the darkest skin it falls short of the AAD's recommendation of a daily SPF of at least 15 for everyone. Crutchfield feels many ethnic groups are missing that key part of the message, if they are getting the message at all. Blog: How to pick the right sunscreen . Researchers acknowledge that many of the messages regarding skin cancer prevention have traditionally targeted fair-skinned people, a group 10 times more likely to develop melanoma. Now, dermatologists say, more needs to be done to encourage all groups to take precautions against sun damage. A Consumer Reports survey found only 27 percent of people with self-described darker skin applied sunscreen when they were in the sun for four hours or more, compared with 64 percent of people with self-described light skin. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2009 there will be more than 1 million unreported cases of basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer -- most of them curable -- and that more than 68,000 cases of melanoma will be diagnosed. For melanoma, the key to a cure is early detection. That's why dermatologists caution everyone to be vigilant and learn the risks for their skin type. ""Race is very important because not all skin is the same,"" said Dr. Susan Taylor of The Skin of Color Center, a dermatology group focusing on the needs of patients of color. According to Taylor, people with darker skin often get diagnosed at later stages because the cancers often appear in atypical locations. Melanomas in African-Americans and darker-skinned Hispanics and Asians develop more commonly on the palms, soles of the feet, toenails, fingernails and in mucus membranes like around the mouth and genitals, she said. In Caucasian and lighter-skinned Hispanics, melanomas more frequently appear on the back in men and on the legs in women. Also, the signs of melanoma may vary depending on skin tone. ""Skin hue can affect the way lesions look,"" Crutchfield said. ""Things that appear red in white skin often look completely different in skin of color."" Historically, research and teaching was done on fairer-skinned people, making it more challenging for physicians to recognize suspicious moles on darker skin. While these differences present challenges, they are certainly not barriers. Experts say, the best thing to do is keep it simple. ""If you have any lesion or mole change at all, or if you have a spot that bleeds and doesn't heal in three weeks, see a physician or a dermatologist,"" Dr. Crutchfield recommended. ""That's something everyone can do."" Visit the American Academy of Dermatology Web site to find free screening locations in your state . Another piece of simple advice: ""All racial groups need to use sunscreens,"" Taylor stresses. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both deep-penetrating UVA rays and burn-causing UVB rays. Not all sunscreens protect against both. Visit the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep cosmetic safety database . Tiffany Wilson is heeding that advice. She said she's learned that when it comes to prevention, the worst thing you can possibly do is nothing. ""I use extreme caution in the sun and make certain that I use a sunscreen, even on a cloudy day,"" she said. ""You shouldn't underestimate the rays of the sun.

877,"(CNN) -- Dr Yves Jean-Bart, President of the Haiti Football Federation, tells CNN about the day that the earthquake struck, the devastating aftermath and his hope for the future of soccer in the country. What happened on the day of the earthquake? I went to the federation around 1pm to meet the President of the Women's league and the members of the commission of the league - we had to discuss a lot of matters. Also present at the meeting were Hancy Lescouflair (wife of the Minister of Sports and the Women's League President) and the national head coach Jean Yves Labaze. The meeting was over and I was getting ready to leave when I felt the house shaking. I ran towards the back exit of the house. While going downstairs it was shaking really badly, I lost my balance and fell and blocks of debris fell on my hand. I got up and fell again with a huge amount of debris falling on my body. I was scared but I got up again to move away from the house that I then saw collapse in a white cloud. With the few that were able to escape this tragedy, and also the friends of the football family, we started helping people trapped under the rubble. During the whole night, even in darkness and with their lives in danger, those young friends of football saved and removed a few injured colleagues under the rubble. Unfortunately, more than 30 perished and even more saddening, we were not able to recover their body for days. Every day we go to the ruins of our office, and we had a memorial ceremony for all our colleagues that perished. We were helpless, beside three cases, to remove their bodies and return them to their families. What was going through your mind after the earthquake? I had many thoughts going through my head for many days after and not having communication, we were unable to obtain information. When some friends were able to recover my Blackberry, I started working and trying to reorganize. I started by contacting the parents of the young boys and girls, miraculously saved because they were practicing at the National Stadium, and helped those that were in need. I was also deeply in pain with my injuries and the loss of some of my family. Psychologically, I had a lot of questions. I was terribly choked. What was left of the Haiti Football Federation? From the headquarters there was nothing left. All our office equipment, all of what we were able to acquire throughout the years in order to put together a decent office - our efforts to have a nice archive, our trophies and distinctions during the last years - we lost everything. But most of all we lost a lot of colleagues including our best coach for the past years, all the equipment of our national teams, thousands of balls recently purchased everything...everything. How did you cope in those days after the earthquake? It's hard to adapt yourself to this, it's a whole different ball game. I did not have any meds and my injured fingers started to get infected. We were sleeping on the ground with the mosquitoes, the wind, the cold and the loud noises of airplanes coming in and out of the airport. Fortunately some colleagues were able to recover my Blackberry -- it was damaged but functional. We were able to get together, us members of the federation, and we all did our best to get back to work progressively. My kids were fabulous - they were able to send me meds, tents, sleeping bags and some money to cover every day expenses. Physically things got better but it has been a horrible misery up to now. What help did you receive from your neighboring countries and from FIFA itself? The support we received was the most comforting. Less than four days after the earthquake, Captain Burrell, the President of the Jamaican Football Federation, arrived in two helicopters sent by the Presidents of FIFA & CONCACAF. We accompanied him on a small tour of the town and met leaders in the stadium and on the ruins of our headquarters. The very emotional report that he wrote touched the world football family even more on the hugeness of the tragedy. The president of the Dominican Football Federation sent colleagues to check on us and find out about our needs. He also sent me some meds that were very precious. President Blatter and a lot of his colleagues called me and assured me that we were not alone. About two weeks ago, with a lot of difficulties, FIFA Vice-President Jack Warner made it to Port-au-Prince in a private plane and brought us meds, foods and water. He promised to motivate the FIFA committee about our needs, promised that FIFA would help our national teams to keep competing, all in all helping us rebuild our soccer. At FIFA, last Tuesday, during the meeting of the associations, a lot of Presidents of Federations were present. A minute's silence was observed for all the victims of the earthquake and during a special meeting, President Blatter announced to me that a special fund was created for the reconstruction of our football. FIFA experts will come to Haiti soon to evaluate our needs, build projects that FIFA will finance from this newly created fund. This is a big solidarity move. On February 26 with the help of the Venezuelan government we will play a charity game in Caracas. On March 7th, with the help of a German TV station, our men's national team will play a game to raise funds that will be used to rebuild the stadium of Leogane that was completely destroyed. Some former world athletes have agreed to participate in this game. The Germans have already visited this stadium and plan to help us for a while with this project. Soccer federations of the whole world - Qatar, Switzerland, Honduras, Nicaragua and Mexico -- offered their help and we are deeply touched by this move. How many of Haiti's players were affected by the earthquake? The number of dead and injured announced, is really, really far from reality. The very bad construction of the country, the lack of organization in general, the fact that the first response help got on the ground days after, will make the final numbers very high, higher than the official numbers given. Fortunately with the fact the earthquake happened at 4:53pm, the players of Divisions 1 and 2 were unharmed. The players lost immediate families: parents, wives, children. A lot of young players are orphans. When communication is fully restored and obviously when teams start training again, we will have an idea but the numbers will never be exact. How does Haiti as a country feel about football? There is not one Haitian that has not touched a soccer ball. Football is part of the everyday life of Haiti, even with the scary living conditions in Port-au-Prince, even with the fields being occupied, they still play soccer. It is the only entertainment reserved for everybody. At the federation we had the great idea of distributing in the temporary shelters the few soccer balls we were able to recover and it was an explosion of joy. I think it is necessary and mandatory, to help with the psychological recovery of a major part of the population, to free the fields and allow the people to release some stress. In times of crisis like this does it help having something like football help to focus you? It is a big challenge that motivates us better, gives us the desire to live. My biggest objective is for the soccer family to become more united every day, because until recently the soccer family was disunited. We feel that we have more responsibility than before. With all this solidarity coming from all around the world, with the situation of the youth, with this cruel misery and this sudden loss for everybody, we feel that soccer has an important role to play in the reconstruction of this country. How will you rebuild the federation and how long will it take? It will be difficult - the conditions are impossible for us. My colleagues at the federation are aware that every time we try to restart the soccer world in Haiti an unfortunate situation puts us back to square one. In 2003 we had to stop everything during a political crisis. In 2003 we had Hurricane Jeanne. In 2005 there was the security crisis with the departure of President Aristide. In 2008 there were the four hurricanes of the summer. Every time it is an exodus of talent, the loss of the buying power of the population and each time we have to start from scratch. Fortunately with new players, the work that we maintain with the young players, with the heavy support of FIFA, we climbed back up the ladder because in all age categories our teams are some of the best in the region. Do you think the federation will grow strong again in the future? I want to talk about construction and reconstruction at the same time. Haitian soccer has existed for more than 100 years. Soccer is a tradition deeply involved in the culture, the life of the country. The misery of the country affected its international evolvement but not its creativity, its popularity, its power and national weight. In this domain, with no doubt, everything exists, we will have to motivate - sensibly, because the human factor exists - in order to create an elite of players, to allow young talents to use soccer to get out of the misery, with the goal of obtaining a major professional contract and bringing money back to the country, or attending school abroad. We need to take charge of the most talented and ask for the resources that we need. We ask for infrastructures in the reconstruction process that the government will start to put at the service of these young talents and sports associations. The Latin American countries insisted on sports infrastructures that didn't exist for the youth. FIFA will help to rebuild our headquarters. It should be a reality before the end of this year. For the destroyed fields at Leoganea and Petit Goave, this should not take time. Destroyed or not by the earthquake, all the soccer fields are only by name, all of them need to be rebuilt because they weren't really existent before. With the lack of resources we had in the past we were able to accomplish so much, now with all the support that we will get, we will come back stronger than before.","January's earthquake killed 30 of Haiti's Football Federation officials .

878,"(CNN) -- Actor Patrick Swayze's achievements include several feature films such as ""Dirty Dancing"" and ""Ghost,"" as well as living with advanced pancreatic cancer for longer than most patients. Patrick Swayze died at age 57 of pancreatic cancer. He fought the disease for nearly two years. That Swayze, who died Monday at age 57, survived nearly two years with the condition is ""quite an accomplishment,"" Dr. George Fisher, an oncologist who treated the star at Stanford Hospitals and Clinics, told CNN's Larry King on Tuesday. Fisher revealed in early March 2008 that the actor was fighting pancreatic cancer. Swayze participated in a clinical trial at Stanford and took an experimental drug there, Fisher said. Fewer than one in four patients who have the disease that has spread outside the pancreas, as Swayze did, are alive a year later, he said.  Watch Fisher talk to King about Swayze's case » . ""Patients can survive two years -- even longer, even with standard treatment,"" Fisher said. ""It's just sad that not as many do."" Pancreatic cancer has affected several other prominent figures, including National Collegiate Athletic Association President Myles Brand, who died of the disease Wednesday. Apple Inc.'s Steve Jobs and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg have also undergone treatment for the disease. The American Cancer Society puts pancreatic cancer as the fourth most common cause of death from cancer in the United States. Lung, colon and breast cancer are the first three. Experts say that about 95 percent of those with pancreatic cancer die from the disease. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice or sudden weight loss may lead doctors to look for pancreatic cancer, said Dr. Steven Cohen, acting chief for gastrointestinal medical oncology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Cohen was not involved in Swayze's care. Doctors say early detection carries a better chance of curing the cancer, but often a patient's disease is diagnosed after it has spread. CAT scans may detect the disease early, but that does not mean everyone should have a scan with their physical, Fisher said. ""We're developing algorithms for trying to identify people at risk, and then less invasive ... tests to try to figure out who's got it and who doesn't,"" he said. Despite his illness, Swayze went forward with plans to star in A&E network's ""The Beast."" After the actor responded well to cancer treatment, the network agreed to shoot an entire season of the show. Working on the show while undergoing treatment was ""a great idea,"" Fisher said on ""Larry King Live."" ""I had my doubts as to whether he could actually do it or not, and we had many conversations around that fact,"" Fisher said. Swayze understood ""how difficult the treatment could be, and he understood how difficult the disease could be. But it's just like Patrick to just say he's going to do it and damn it, nobody should get in his way."" ""The Beast"" was canceled in June because of Swayze's illness, after doctors told him the cancer had spread to his liver. For pancreatic cancer patients, doctors are not as concerned with what happens with the pancreas as they are with how the disease spreads elsewhere, often to the liver or abdominal cavity, Cohen said. Failure of other organs that the cancer affects may ultimately cause death. Swayze's participation in the Stanford clinical trial is an important take-away point, Cohen said. Only about 5 percent of cancer patients participate in clinical trials, he said. ""Particularly for a disease like pancreatic cancer, where the standard treatments help some patients but not the majority, the ability to look at new treatments that are promising in the context and controlled setting of clinical trials, I think, is really important,"" he said. Dozens of drugs are in development or being tested in trials for pancreatic cancer, Cohen said. One such medication is paclitaxel, which is currently only approved for breast cancer but has shown promise experimentally in pancreatic tumors, he said. Cohen said he and his colleagues encourage patients to continue their daily activities and live their lives normally as best they can while undergoing treatment. A chemotherapy drug commonly used in patients, called gemcitabine, does not have the harsh symptoms of nausea, vomiting and hair loss seen in other cancer drugs. But sometimes, patients are too ill from their underlying cancer to do much, he said. ""Toward the end, they can get increasing abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite, very low energy, sort of a wasting syndrome, and there, a lot of patients just don't feel up to do anything,"" he said.","Patrick Swayze battled pancreatic cancer for nearly two years .

879,"You could blame weeds, trees, and grasses if you start itching, sneezing, coughing, and wheezing this fall. But the usual suspects aren't the only triggers. A host of household items -- candles, chemicals, stuffed animals, and spices -- may be the real culprits. From blue jeans buttons to limes to teddybears, allergy triggers  come in many ways, shapes and forms. ""Many homes are filled with irritants, and if there's a high enough count of an irritant, you'll react,"" says Christopher Randolph, M.D., an allergy expert and professor of pediatric immunology at Yale University. Here, a rundown of 11 sneaky suspects -- and how to stop them from bothering you. Candles . You can't be allergic to essential oils -- which make candles smell like autumn leaves or dune grass -- but their odors can inflame your nasal cavities, according to James Wedner, M.D., chief of allergy and immunology at the Washington University School of Medicine. ""People with nasal allergies have a natural increased sensitivity, so they're likely to get a runny nose or watery eyes around candles,"" he says. ""To the person with the sensitive nose, it's no different than cigarette smoke."" What to do: If you're very sensitive, avoid candles altogether. But if you love the smell and want to use them at home, buy candles that have few ingredients and feature just one scent, such as pumpkin. By a process of elimination you may be able to pinpoint which scent or ingredient bothers you. (Smoke from candles can also be an irritant, though that usually comes from snuffing it out; open a window or blow out the flame outside.) If you have a bad reaction to a scented candle, getting some fresh air should make you feel better. Perfume . Fragrances can contain hundreds of chemicals that are mostly untested on humans, Wedner says. When those chemicals bond with the essential oils in perfumes and are then sprayed into the air, sensitive people may take offense. Sneezing, congestion, and headaches can be the result. What to do: Kindly ask your colleagues to go easy on their favorite fragrances, and bring a portable fan to keep your area as scent-free as possible. If the thought of not wearing a fragrance leaves you blue, stick with body creams and moisturizers that have light scents. These are less likely to irritate you. Soaps and detergents . You think it's the chemicals in cleaning products that make you itch? Surprise: ""The majority of skin sensitivities are caused not by the cleaning agent but by a perfume additive,"" Wedner says. ""And nearly every soap now has some sort of plant in it to make it fancy -- roses, elderberries, etc. The skin can respond with irritation, and give you a rash."" Read more on how to identify a rash . What to do: Buy organic or specially marked soaps; look for ""no additives,"" ""nonscented,"" or ""phthalate-free"" on the label. Phthalates are chemicals that help improve texture, but they've been linked to allergic reactions; products that contain them may have ""diethylphthalate"" or something similar on the label. Dove, Tide, and Ivory all offer low-irritant products, as do many organic brands. If fabric softener seems to be giving your skin fits, try using a sheet of aluminum foil in your dryer instead; this trick will get rid of static cling. Or use a scent-free, no-additive version, like Seventh Generation Free & Clear Natural Fabric Softener. If you're in a public laundromat, wash and dry towels first, which will soak up the residue left behind by previous users. Then be sure to use that same washer and dryer to clean and dry your clothes. Stuffed animals . Dust mites living in mattresses and pillows are a huge allergy trigger. Roughly 15 percent of the population is allergic to these microscopic bugs. Encasing mattresses and pillows with impen­etrable covers and cases is a useful step, but it's not enough. The mites also love kids' favorite furry toys. What to do: Wash, dry, then repeat ... and use very hot water. ""Toys should be washed at 140 degrees, which will ensure that the mites are killed,"" Randolph says. After they're clean store them on a shelf, not on the bed. What to do with the nonwashable toys? Every two to three weeks put them in a plastic bag in the freezer for a couple of hours, which will also kill the mites. Carpeting . You may love the feel of carpeting under your feet, but mites find it just as attractive. ""Even if you vacuum constantly, you've still got mites,"" Wedner warns. What to do: Remove wall-to-wall carpeting -- who doesn't like a beautiful wood floor? -- and use small rugs that can be washed in hot water monthly. ""And keep the humidity below 50 percent"" with your central air system or a dehumidifier, Randolph says. ""Dust mites thrive in humidity."" Read more on how to allergy-proof your house . Spices . They add nuance and zing to a variety of dishes, but there's no getting around spices' origin: pungent plants. For some people, eating the spices made from these plants leads to a just little sniffling. For others, it may cause itching, swelling, and even burning of the lips. What to do: Avoid the spices more likely to cause trouble: coriander, poppy seeds, pepper, dill, paprika, cumin, and saffron -- which, in broad strokes, means Indian and Middle Eastern food. If you're not sure which spices bother you, record what you've been exposed to each time you have symptoms and look for the common denominator. Need help planning an allergen-free Halloween? Read on for some tips . Christmas trees . A word to the wise before the holidays: Mold grows fast on Christmas trees. ""When you put that tree in a bucket of water, invisible mold grows almost immediately,"" Wedner says. ""Most people are allergic to or irritated by mold spores."" What to do: Try a fake tree. Can't live without a real one? Ask when it was cut down before you buy it; trees that were cut weeks in advance are already ripe with mold. Then, starve it of water and keep it for as short a period as possible. Mold grows on houseplants, too, so keep them on the dry side. Wall paint . The solvents and synthetic resins used in paint often lead to itchy eyes and headaches. Oil-based paints are a particular problem because they can continue releasing chemicals even after they dry. What to do: Keep windows open as often as possible and allow fresh air to circulate for four weeks after painting, no matter what kind of paint you use. ""Once it has dried -- and I mean really dried, weeks later -- the odor goes away, and you won't have a problem,"" Wedner says. If possible, use latex paint, which emits less gas than oil-based kinds due to its water base. By the way, there isn't any real latex in latex paint, so if you're allergic to latex gloves the same won't apply to the paint. What about paint with low levels of VOCs (volatile organic compounds)? They spew fewer chemicals into the air and are less smelly than regular paints. But that doesn't mean they won't bother you. To find these paints, look for the ""Green Seal"" certification mark on the label. Alcohol . An actual allergy to alcohol is quite rare, but being allergic to the grains and additives used in liquor is not: wheat or the preservative sulfur dioxide could cause a rash or a stuffy nose. New York City allergist Wellington Tichenor, MD, founder of the information site Sinuses.com, also blames grains like corn, bar­ley, and rye, as well as fruit flavorings. Wine and beer may create problems, too. What to do: Stick with grain-free liquors like potato vodka, rum (made from sugar), and tequila (the agave plant). Skip all flavored liquers. And if sulfite preservatives in wine bother you, red wine tends to have fewer preservatives than white. Also, look for wine labeled ""sulfite-free"" (it won't stay fresh for long). And remember that anything with carbonation (like a wine cooler) increases the likelihood of an allergic reaction, Tichenor adds. Blue jeans buttons . The buttons on your jeans are probably made with the metal nickel -- a rash trigger for up to 20 percent of women. A nickel rash near your waistline is usually itchy, red, and sometimes blistery. What to do: Take your pants to a tailor and have her replace the nickel buttons with plastic ones (another metal might also cause irritation). A second option: Coat the button with clear nail polish, a remedy found to be effective in a recent St. Louis University study. Just be aware that nail polish itself may lead to a rash if you're sensitive to it. Lemons and limes . Limonene, a zesty compound in lime and other citrus fruits, gives many people watery eyes and a burning sensation in the nose, Wedner says. It might even irritate your skin, whether you touch it or eat or drink products containing limonene. What to do: If you get a rash, treat it with topical hydrocortisone creams used for bug bites and poison ivy. Skip the lemon or lime wedge with your drink or salad, and look out for lime in salad dressings, desserts, and marinades (it's used in numerous dishes).

880,"Bakuriani, Georgia (CNN) -- The 21-year-old Georgian luger who propelled to his death after sliding off the track during an Olympic practice run in Vancouver was laid to rest in his hometown Saturday. Some 4,000 citizens from every walk of life mourned silently as Nodar Kumaritashvili was buried in his hometown of Bakuriani. The mourners included President Mikhail Saakashvili, who was clad in a Georgian Olympics shirt to show his national solidarity. ""I wanted to throw a wedding feast for you,"" the athlete's father, David Kumaritashvili, said in a eulogy. ""Instead we have a funeral."" Kumaritashvili died during a practice run when he slammed into a steel pole near the end of the 4,500-foot-long course and was propelled off the track, according to the International Olympics Committee. A preliminary inquiry said human error caused the accident because he came out of a turn too late. But Nodar's family and many Georgians don't accept that explanation. There had been concerns from athletes about the speed of the record-setting track at the Whistler Sliding Center in Vancouver ahead of the opening of the 2010 Winter Olympics, according to a Georgian official. ""There were some questions asked by other athletes even before this tragic accident,"" said Nikolas Rurua, Georgia's deputy minister for culture and sports, adding that there had been several crashes in the same area. ""But at this moment it would be premature for me to jump to any conclusions."" Video of the crash shows Kumaritashvili lying motionless after being thrown from his sled and striking the pole when he was coming out of the course's last turn. He was given cardio-pulmonary resuscitation by medical staff on site before being transported to a hospital where doctors were unable to revive him, the IOC said. The luge is often called the ""fastest sport on ice."" Sliders use their legs and shoulders to steer small fiberglass sleds down an icy track, at times approaching or surpassing speeds of 90 mph, according to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics Web site. They are positioned on their backs with their feet straight out in front of them and their heads back to be as aerodynamic as possible. A track speed record -- and world speed record -- was recorded at Whistler on February 21, 2009, when a single men's luge athlete, Germany's Felix Loch, topped 95 mph during competition. American luger Tony Benshoof held the previous world speed record of 86.8 mph set in 2001. A somber seven-member Georgian delegation wore black armbands to the February 12 opening ceremonies, and a black ribbon was tied atop the Georgian flag in tribute to Kumaritashvili. The team received a standing ovation from the 60,000 spectators in attendance. Kumaritashvili's death was the first time an athlete had been killed during the games since 1992, when a Swiss skier crashed into a snow-clearing machine on a public trail while training in the closing days of the games, according to NBC News, the official broadcaster of the Vancouver Games. Journalist Eka Kadagishvili contributed to this report.","Nodar Kumaritashvili killed during Olympics practice run in Vancouver .

881,"(CNN) -- A strengthening El Nino is expected to bring torrential rain Thursday to parts of Southern California, including Los Angeles, and authorities warned of possibly severe mudslides in areas denuded by forest fires. The storm could dump 8 inches to 10 inches of rain on the Los Angeles area and higher amounts in the foothills, the National Weather Service said. Late Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa -- expecting a dangerous storm Wednesday -- urged hundreds of Californians to leave their homes. A torrential rainfall Tuesday unleashed flooding and spawned a rare tornado warning.  Are you being affected by the storms? Send your images, video . There has been some resistance to the advice, a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department said. The detective, who wouldn't give her entire name, said she didn't know how many people decided to leave.  Flash flooding on California golf course . There was heavy rain Wednesday in San Francisco and Sacramento, California, but Los Angeles had little precipitation as of about noon.  Driving by homes, businesses under water . A warm ocean current from the South Pacific is responsible for this week's storms, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. With little vegetation to help contain the water, the vast expanses in southern California that were hit by wildfires late last summer are causing concern for officials. The largest of the fires -- known as the Station Fire -- charred 250 square miles of land last summer north and east of Los Angeles. ""If you are lower in elevation than where a fire happened earlier this year, you need to be very, very cautious,"" Myers said. Forecasters said several feet of snow would fall in the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada through the rest of this week, as low pressure systems continue moving into the area.","El Nino expected to bring torrential rain Thursday to parts of Southern California .

882,"(CNN) -- Federal investigators have found salmonella bacteria in chicken feed and in barn and walkway areas at Iowa farms at the center of the nationwide outbreak, officials said. The feed or feed ingredients could have become contaminated after they went through heat treatment that was sufficient to kill salmonella, officials from the Food and Drug Administration told reporters. Produced at a mill at a Wright County Egg Co. facility, the feed was given to pullet chickens at both Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms, which between them recalled more than a half-billion eggs since the salmonella outbreak. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a total of 2,403 cases of Salmonella enteriditis had been reported in the United States between May 1 and August 25. Normally, 933 cases would be reported in that time period. The dramatic difference of 1,470 cases may be linked, at least in part, to the outbreak and the tainted eggs, a CDC spokeswoman said. Officials indicated in a conference call that this is the largest Salmonella enteriditis outbreak since tracking began in the mid-1970s. Testing at Wright County Egg farms in Iowa showed the presence of salmonella in the food mill and in manure at two locations, said Sherri McGarry of the Food and Drug Administration. She said investigators are still drawing samples at Hillandale Farms. ''Feed were the sources [of the salmonella], but perhaps not the only sources,"" McGarry said. The feed could have been contaminated in a number of ways, including by birds, rodents and people's shoes or boots, officials said. Wright County Egg, in a statement issued later Thursday, said it will ""work with FDA as they expand their review of feed ingredients purchased from outside vendors for our farm, as well as for their ongoing review of our farms."" ""FDA while on our farm tested meat and bone meal that is provided by a third-party supplier as an ingredient for our feed. The ingredient is held separately in an overhead bin that was tested by FDA officials prior to being mixed in with our feed. ""This finding obviously is of great concern to us. As part of our internal investigation and in response to FDA's initial consideration of feed as a possible source, on August 23 we pulled and sent samples of all ingredients used in our feed for further SE [Salmonella enteriditis] testing. In addition, today we provided FDA with information about our third-party supplier and immediately notified that supplier of the testing results. ... ""We have received from FDA three positive environmental SE tests. It's important to understand that a positive environmental test does not mean eggs from that barn would have SE."" Wright County Egg spokeswoman Hinda Mitchell said the third-party supplier and manufacturer is Central Bi-Products. A call to the company was not immediately returned Thursday night. Thursday's update by federal regulators came amid rising questions of how the companies monitored their facilities and the speed of the government response. Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, announced a House subcommittee will hold hearings September 14 on the safety of the nation's food supply. The subcommittee has requested inspection reports and notices of any violations, among other documents, from Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms. ""We are working right now to respond to the Committee, and we will approach it in the same forthright manner as we have in our cooperation with FDA to date,"" said Mitchell, confirming that owner Jack DeCoster has been invited to appear. Hillandale Farms founder Orland Bethel also has been asked to attend, said spokeswoman Julie DeYoung, who likewise said the company is cooperating with officials. Dr. Jeff Farrar, the associate commissioner for food safety at the FDA, said it took weeks to trace the clusters of salmonella reports to contaminated eggs. Officials didn't believe a massive early recall made sense, nor did they want to wait for confirmed laboratory results, he said. ""We have to strike a balance between being timely and accurate,"" Farrar said of the FDA's move August 11 to ask the companies to do a voluntary recall. Iowa does not have an egg quality assurance program, McGarry said. ""We are not sure how and when this feed could have been contaminated,"" she said. FDA officials said new producer egg safety rules, which took effect in July after the outbreak began, will greatly reduce the possibility of a similar salmonella outbreak in the future. More people are likely to report becoming sick because of the two to three weeks it takes for salmonella to manifest itself, said Dr. Christopher R. Braden, acting director of the Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases at the CDC. No deaths have been linked to the outbreak, regulators said. Braden said elderly people living in nursing homes have not fallen sick, as they might have in past outbreaks. Increased egg safety procedures in restaurants, along with pasteurization and thorough cooking, have put a dent into the outbreak, he added. Egg consumers had two new brand names to search for in their refrigerators. Wright County Egg, which was responsible for 380 million of the 550 million recalled eggs, said 60-egg cases sold under the Cardenas Market brand in California and Nevada were being recalled.  Eggs included in the recall are labeled with plant number 1026 and date codes ranging from 136 to 228. Dates and codes can be found printed on the label. The plant number begins with the letter P and then the number.  The Julian date follows the plant number, for example:  P-1026 228. In addition, Trafficanda Egg Ranch released a statement saying it was doing a voluntary recall of Wright County-supplied shell eggs. The Trafficanda Egg Ranch-branded eggs were distributed to grocery stores and food-service companies in California in 12-egg cartons, 20-egg over-wrapped packages, and 60-egg over-wrapped packages with date codes ranging from 136 to 229 and plant numbers 1026, 1413, 1720, 1942 and 1946. According to a spokeswoman for the Egg Safety Center, the two newest ""subrecalls"" don't add to the total number of eggs recalled; both the Cardenas Market and Trafficanda Egg Ranch eggs were counted already as part of Wright County Egg's 380 million. New regulations went into effect July 9 requiring egg producers with more than 3,000 hens to take measures designed to prevent the spread of salmonella. While FDA inspectors typically didn't inspect farms until after an outbreak of illness, Farrar, the associate commissioner for food safety at the FDA, said that under the new rule, ""We will be beginning routine inspections of egg farms throughout the United States."" While the recall involves hundreds of millions of eggs, they represent less than 1 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the United States each year, said Krista Eberle, director of the food safety program at the Egg Safety Center. But even that risk level is too high for some restaurant patrons in Michigan, the most recently added state on the list of those receiving tainted eggs. ""It makes you not even want to order or buy the eggs,"" Audrey Karas, a customer at a Big Boy in Warren, Michigan, told CNN affiliate WDIV. Big Boy uses eggs unaffected by the recall. ""It makes you uneasy about buying eggs, even if they are supposed to be safe.""

883,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered its inspectors to make sure regional airlines' training programs are in line with federal regulations, authorities announced Tuesday. Regional airline Colgan Air's Flight 3407 crashed near Buffalo, New York, on February 12. ""It's clear to us in looking at the February Colgan Air crash in Buffalo that there are things we should be doing now,"" FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said. ""My goal is to make sure that the entire industry -- from large commercial carriers to smaller, regional operators -- is meeting our safety standard."" Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed near Buffalo, New York, on February 12, killing all 49 passengers and crew members aboard. One person on the ground was also killed. Federal investigators held hearings on Capitol Hill last month on the cause of the crash but have not concluded their inquiry. Several shortcomings of the crew came to light during the National Transportation and Safety Board hearings when it was revealed that Colgan Air Capt. Marvin Renslow failed to reveal two pilot exam failures in his job application. Testimony at the hearings also revealed that fatigue apparently contributed to the failure of Renslow and First Officer Rebecca Shaw to save the plane as it approached Buffalo Niagara International Airport. USA Today newspaper reviewed the safety board's accident reports over the past 10 years and found that in nearly every serious accident involving a regional airline during that time, at least one of the pilots had failed multiple skill tests. ""In eight of the nine accidents during that time, which killed 137 people, pilots had a history of failing two or more 'check rides,' tests by federal or airline inspectors of pilots' ability to fly and respond to emergencies,"" USA Today reported Sunday. ""In the lone case in which pilots didn't have multiple failures since becoming licensed, the co-pilot was fired after the nonfatal crash for falsifying his job application."" In addition to reviewing regional airlines' training programs, Babbitt and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood have called on representatives from major air carriers, their regional partners, aviation industry groups and labor to participate in a ""call to action"" in Washington on Monday, according to a U.S. Department of Transportation news release. The review will address pilot training, cockpit discipline and other flight safety issues, the release said.","FAA to examine training at regional airlines to make sure it meets federal standards .

884,"Devecser, Hungary (CNN) -- Rescue workers searched Wednesday for six elderly people missing at Kolontar, one of three villages in southwest Hungary that was hit Monday by a wave of toxic red sludge from an alumina plant reservoir that burst. Wearing chemical protection suits, the workers used metal sticks to poke through muck three-feet deep (1 meter) for the presumed victims, reported MTI, Hungary's official news agency. At least 116 people were injured, eight of them seriously, when the mishap occurred Monday afternoon, the agency said. Most of them were flown to hospitals in the capital, Budapest. The reservoir has been repaired and the flow from the pool has halted. But the material that flowed out of the reservoir continued to pose a threat. On Wednesday, more than 500 National Disaster Management Authority staffers and soldiers and employees of Hungarian Aluminum Production and Trade Company (MAL), the company that owns the alumina plant's reservoir, were trying to halt the advance of the sludge before it reaches the Danube River's tributaries, said Jeno Lasztovicza, head of the defense committee, according to MTI. The sludge had already reached the Marcal River, which flows into the River Raba, which empties into the Danube. It was expected to show up in the Danube as soon as this weekend, said Imre Szakacs, head of Gyor-Moson-Sopron County's defense authority, MTI said. Emergency workers were pouring plaster and fertilizers into the Marcal River in hopes that it would bind with the sludge and counter its alkalinity before it reached the Danube, the continent's second-longest river, some 70 km (43 miles) north, reported MTI. But the material will have been neutralized by the time it reaches the Raba, Interior Minister Sandor Pinter told reporters. Untreated, the sludge contains heavy metals, which cause burns and eye irritation, he said. Four people -- two children ages 1 and 3, an elderly woman and a 35-year-old man whose SUV overturned in the sludge -- have been confirmed dead in the environmental disaster, which occurred 160 km (99 miles) west of Budapest, near the town of Ajka. Residents were advised not to eat produce from gardens that were covered when the dam burst, releasing at least 1 million cubic meters of thick red mud. It was not clear when residents evacuated from affected areas in the villages of Kolontar, Devecser and Somlovasarhely would be able to return home, nor were the long-term consequences clear. A state of emergency has been declared in three counties, the State Secretariat of Governmental Communications said. In a statement on its website, MAL said it ""offers its honest condolences to the relatives of all of the victims who lost their lives in the catastrophe.""

885,"Jackson, Mississippi (CNN) -- LaShawn Traylor was rushed to the hospital as Hurricane Katrina was carving its way through South Florida on August 25, 2005. She couldn't breathe and she was seven months pregnant. Doctors told her she had an enlarged heart and needed an emergency Cesarean section or Traylor and her baby would die. Lorenzo Traylor was born weighing 2 pounds, 11 ounces. But LaShawn Traylor slipped into a medically induced coma and was put on a ventilator inside Methodist Hospital in east New Orleans, Louisiana, not far from the city's Lower 9th Ward. Read about another mother's separation story . As she lay in the coma, Hurricane Katrina became a monster storm and the pleas for New Orleans residents to evacuate got louder. Lionel Traylor decided he and his wife's four other children would drive to Jackson, Mississippi for a few days. ""I left a picture of Lorenzo on her chest and kissed her goodbye. I thought we'd be back in a few days,"" Lionel Traylor said. Three days later, LaShawn Traylor emerged from the coma, but she was alone. On August 28, 2005, then-New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin issued a mandatory evacuation of the city. Nurses told Traylor her premature newborn was taken to another hospital for better care. This was the beginning of Traylor's Katrina ordeal, a separation that would take months to overcome. ""When I woke up they said the storm was coming, but it was sunny outside,"" said Traylor. ""I couldn't imagine how serious it was."" The next part of the story is well documented. The storm came, the levees broke and New Orleans flooded. The bottom floors of Methodist Hospital filled with water. There was no escape for Traylor and hundreds of other patients. ""It was horrific; it was chaotic. It was something out of a horror movie,"" she said. The scene inside Methodist Hospital deteriorated with every passing hour. Without power, patients on ventilators were dying. Doctors and nurses were using their hands to keep the ventilator pumps going and patients alive. Food and water was dwindling. ""I thought I was going to die,"" Traylor said. ""It was pitch dark and it was really scary."" And in the midst of all this, Traylor couldn't stop thinking about her baby boy. She hadn't even had a chance to hold him or call him by his new name, Lorenzo. She'd been told that Lorenzo was taken to Children's Hospital. But if her world was collapsing what was happening to Lorenzo, she thought to herself. As more time passed she feared the worst. ""I thought Lorenzo was dead already,"" Traylor said. ""I thought who in the world is going to keep up with a 2-pound baby during times like this."" Two days after the storm, helicopters started landing on the rooftop of Methodist Hospital to evacuate patients. Traylor says she was airlifted and dropped off on a bridge on the western edge of New Orleans. She spent the next 18 hours sitting under a bridge, still recovering from the delivery, waiting for help. LaShawn Traylor says, ""a nurse told me she didn't think I was going to make it."" Dehydration was taking its toll. On September 1 help arrived in the form of a bus ride to the New Orleans airport and a seat on an airplane out of town. When she arrived at the airport, I was there reporting on the evacuation efforts. Traylor was in a line of female patients evacuated from the Methodist Hospital maternity ward. All the other mothers had newborn babies in their arms, LaShawn Traylor was only holding Polaroid pictures of Lorenzo. She approached me and said, ""I don't know where my baby is. I'm looking for my baby."" It was a rushed interview, the moment so chaotic that I only had time to get a few basic facts. But moments later we broadcast her story, and Traylor and the picture of her baby boy were loaded onto a plane bound for Texas. ""All they told us is you need to get out of the city. I didn't want to leave the city without knowing where my baby was; I just thought that was weird,"" Traylor said. A friend of Traylor saw the interview and relayed word to her husband, who had now gone six days without hearing a word about his wife and baby. But when Lionel Traylor finally tracked down his wife in a Red Cross shelter in Fort Worth, Texas, the most important part of the story wasn't passed along accurately. ""I thought Lorenzo was with her and when I first saw her she told me 'I don't know where the baby is' and that's when my heart sank,"" said Lionel Traylor. Aid workers and caregivers heard Traylor's story and started making an intense round of phone calls. In a September 14, 2005, posting on the website of U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess of Fort Worth, the congressman's staff detailed the efforts to track down Lorenzo. ""Lorenzo had traveled to three different hospitals during the hectic evacuation,"" according to the congressman's website. ""After 24 hours of searching...""Baby Boy Traylor"" had been located at Baton Rouge General. The moments that followed were priceless -- tears of joy followed by laughter."" The family tried to return to New Orleans, the city both LaShawn and Lionel Traylor had always called home. They returned four months after Katrina to find their home destroyed by the floodwaters. They moved into a FEMA trailer but for a family of seven it proved too difficult. ""Going back to a city that needed to be rebuilt was just too much for the kids, leaving New Orleans was really hard,"" said LaShawn Traylor. In Jackson, Mississippi, the Traylor family is flourishing. Lorenzo is healthy and 5 years old. LaShawn Traylor is 31 and returned to school, completing degrees in accounting and psychology. Lionel Traylor is a full-time pastor of The Church at Jackson. LaShawn Traylor also started a foundation helping Katrina evacuees called ""Rise Above Katrina."" The organization helps Katrina survivors find homes, rental assistance and offers financial planning. ""Life is better now,"" says LaShawn Traylor. ""What Katrina did for me was a wake-up call; it made me start to live my life in a better way. I'm living my life now with a purpose.""","Days before Katrina slammed into New Orleans, LaShawn Traylor gave birth to a son .

886,"(CNN) -- After dealing a walloping blow to Haiti, where at least six people died and a number of homes were destroyed, Tropical Storm Tomas weakened rapidly Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. As of 4 p.m. ET, Tomas was located about 500 miles (805 kilometers) south-southwest of Bermuda, forecasters said. It was downgraded to a tropical storm early Sunday. Its maximum sustained winds were at 60 mph (95 kph), but Tomas was not posing a threat to land. The storm was heading north-northeast at near 3 mph (6 kph). It was forecast to turn northeast or east-northeast and accelerate in the next couple of days, the Hurricane Center said in its last advisory on Tomas. Further weakening is expected, forecasters said. In Haiti, a nation still grappling with the effects of a killer earthquake and a deadly cholera outbreak this year, Tomas ruined houses and turned some streets into rivers. Six people were also killed by the storm, according to the Haitian Civil Protection Authority. January's 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed 250,000 people and left 1 million more homeless. Many of those Haitians have been living in tent camps, and aid workers had been working in recent days to move the residents to safer housing, which was difficult to find. Aid workers were already struggling to keep up with the cholera outbreak, which has killed 501 people since the first cases were reported in October. An additional 7,000 are hospitalized. The bacterial disease causes diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to deadly dehydration within hours. In Leogane, west of Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince, residents waded in knee-deep water after Tomas. Box trucks got stuck in water, said relief worker Roseann Dennery of Samaritan's Purse. While the flooding receded somewhat over the weekend, the threat of waterborne disease remained a concern. ""Samaritan's Purse is moving quickly to set up cholera treatment centers in areas where there currently aren't any, and where new cases are appearing as the bacteria continues to spread,"" Dennery said. Mudslides also remain a risk because many of the nation's mountains have been stripped of vegetation, which means rain can flow downhill relatively unimpeded, said CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. ""We could see mudslides a week after the storm has passed,"" Wolf said. Tomas has also dumped more than 10 inches of rain in the Dominican Republic. Earlier, it caused extensive damage and killed 12 people on St. Lucia and also caused damage on St. Vincent.

887,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- International flights to the Indonesian island of Bali were canceled Friday because of volcanic ash, according to a transportation official. Mount Bromo in East Java has been erupting since late last year. Although the threat level was downgraded recently, it continues to spew out ash columns, according to the Indonesian Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation agency. East Java is in close proximity to Bali. A volcanic ash monitoring center in Darwin, in northern Australia, issued a Notice to Airmen warning that the ash could affect aviation. That prompted all international airlines to cancel flights. International flights of the airlines Cathay Pacific, Virgin Blue, Jetstar and Value were affected, said Bambang Ervan, spokesman of the Transportation Ministry. Domestic flights were not canceled, as the they may go through another air route that is deemed safer, officials said. ""Our team and also the (Bali's) Ngurah Rai Airport team is still monitoring the conditions at the airport,"" Ervan said. Airlines are asking passengers to check flights before the scheduled date of departure for updates.","An ash cloud has affected flights to the Indonesian island of Bali .

888,"(CNN) -- Aid is getting to Haiti but it's not as simple as getting a direct flight to the quake-battered nation. CNN followed one aid container from the headquarters of ShelterBox in Cornwall, England, to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to see the hurdles aid groups face. Minutes after the earthquake struck on January 12, the ShelterBox crew sprang into action. The international disaster relief organization is the brainchild of Tom Henderson, who was recognized as a CNN Hero in 2008. ""If you've lost everything as they have in Haiti, it's all about shelter, warmth, comfort and dignity,"" says Henderson. ""That's what ShelterBox is."" A ShelterBox container -- containing relief supplies including a 10-person tent, water and blankets -- is designed to be easily carried by two people and stackable for easy storage. To get to Haiti from Cornwall, the box went on four flights and one overland trip over five days before being distributed to a mother and her newborn baby. Once in the Dominican Republic -- Haiti's neighbor -- there were delays because of security concerns and a national holiday that meant local help was limited. The ShelterBox was one of 720 boxes eventually loaded into a four truck convoy in Santa Domingo for a U.N.-escorted drive to Haiti. The drive from Santo Domingo to the Haiti border took about 11 hours because of poor roads and a puncture. Twelve ShelterBoxes are being used to build an emergency field hospital at the airport, said Mark Pearson who is in Haiti for the charity. Each ShelterBox contains individual survival equipment like water carriers, a tool kit and a children's pack containing drawing books, crayons and pens. By February 1, Shelterbox hopes to have more than 7,000 boxes in Haiti, housing up to 70,000 people. But Henderson acknowledges there is much more to be done. ""There are thousands of people dying every day. That's what drives us forward. This is not a job for us. It's a passion."" Want to get involved?

889,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A young, female suicide bomber was behind a blast in Pakistan that killed at least 46 people and injured 105 others at a food distribution point, an official said Sunday. Zakir Hussain Afridi, the top government official in Bajaur Agency, Pakistan, said that the preliminary investigation into the explosion shows that a girl between the ages of 16 and 18 blew herself up. The determination was made from remains of the bomber that were recovered. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for Saturday's blast in that Asian nation's tribal region. Azam Tariq, the central spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, told CNN in a phone call that it targeted people who had formed what he called a pro-government and anti-Taliban group. The blast took place about 600 meters from a U.N. World Food Programme distribution point at a security checkpoint in Khar, according to Amjad Jamal, a spokesman for the agency. He said that more than 300 people were going through a security screening to get food and other items at the time of the explosion. Khar is the headquarters of Bajaur Agency, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan. Jamal said that those who had been internally displaced during military efforts in Bajaur Agency get a month's supply of food and other goods. Afridi said that the suicide bomber was in a burqa, a traditional full-body covering worn by some Muslim women. He said she was stopped for a security check at a checkpoint, where she detonated herself. The official said it was the first instance of a female suicide bomber in Pakistan that he could recall, though various international news groups have reported at least one previous case of a female suicide bomber in the country. The New York Times reported a woman detonated explosives in Peshawar in 2007, killing herself. The Pakistani Taliban denied that the bomber was a woman. ""We have thousands of male suicide bombers ready who are keenly waiting for their turns. Then why would we use a woman, which is against the traditions of Islam?"" the Pakistani Taliban's Azam Tariq said. Jamal said all staff members of the World Food Programme and its partner organizations are safe, but added that all four of the program's food distribution points in Bajaur Agency have been temporarily closed for security reasons. Still, the U.N. agency will continue to provide services elsewhere in the country, Jamal said. U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement condemning Saturday's ""outrageous terrorist attack,"" which he called ""an affront to the people of Pakistan and to all humanity."" ""The United States stands with the people of Pakistan in this difficult time, and will strongly support Pakistan's efforts to ensure greater peace, security and justice for its people,"" Obama said. The blast took place a day after about 150 militants fired at five security checkpoints in Mohmand Agency -- another of the seven districts in Pakistan's volatile tribal region along the Afghan border -- killing 11 soldiers. Security forces later killed 40 militants who were among the group, authorities said Saturday. The security forces pounded militant hideouts in Mohmand Agency with helicopter gunships, said Maqsood Amin, a senior government official in the area. Twenty-four militants were killed during retaliation Friday while 16 were targeted Saturday. CNN's Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.","An official says the suicide bomber was a teenager .

Sixty-three structures, 21 of them homes, were destroyed, and three civilians and two firefighters were injured. The sheriff's department said the fire forced the evacuation of about 15,000 people. As of Tuesday, 18 of 23 wildfires in Southern California were completely under control, and the remainder were at least 70 percent contained, according to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fires are blamed for 14 deaths and charred more than 508,000 acres, destroying about 1,600 homes. Five people were arrested in arson probes last week, and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Saturday vowed to ""hunt down"" people responsible for setting wildfires.

Witnesses reported seeing the 1998-2004 model truck with chrome tubular running boards on Santiago Canyon Road on October 21 at about the time the Santiago Fire started. Authorities said last week they had found evidence at the scene, although they declined to describe it.

891,"Tokyo (CNN) -- A Japanese volcano was erupting for a second day on Thursday, spewing smoke and ash up to 9,800 feet (3,000 meters) into the air, officials said. The smoke from the Mt. Shinmoe volcano, on the boundary between Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures, is rising and falling from the volcano crater, said the Kagoshima Meteorological Observatory. Some people in Miyazaki voluntarily evacuated Thursday morning, but all have returned home, and the government has issued no evacuation advice, according to the Miyazaki disaster prevention office. However, the alert level was raised Wednesday to 3. That prevents people from entering the mountain area. The eruption began Wednesday. Smoke was drifting southeast, the observatory said. Ash was seen in Miyakonojo city in Kagoshima prefecture. The last Mt. Shinmoe eruption was in July. A large-scale eruption such as this one, however, was last observed about 52 years ago, the meteorological observatory said.","Mt. Shinmoe's last eruption was in July .

892,"(CNN) -- An Indiana judge Monday froze the assets of Marcus Schrenker, a suburban Indianapolis financial manager who authorities say tried to fake his own death by crashing his private plane into a Florida swamp. Marcus Schrenker exited his small plane before it crashed, and investigators are looking for him, police say. Investigators looking into his business dealings for possible securities violations requested the temporary restraining order in Hamilton County Superior Court, said Jim Gavin, spokesman for the Indiana Secretary of State. He said the order, which also applies to Schrenker's wife, Michelle, and to his three companies, is aimed at protecting investors, and is related to a receivership filing. He didn't elaborate. Heritage Wealth Management, Heritage Insurance Services and Icon Wealth Management are ""the subjects of an active investigation by the Indiana Securities Division,"" Gavin said. Public documents list Schrenker as president of Heritage Wealth Management in Fishers, Indiana. A search warrant related to the inquiry was served December 31, Gavin said. According to The Herald Bulletin in Anderson, Indiana, Michelle Schrenker filed for divorce in Hamilton Superior Court on December 30. A hearing was set for February 5. Schrenker, 38, took off alone Sunday night in a corporate plane, a Piper PA-46, from Anderson, Indiana, en route to Destin, Florida. Authorities said the Fisher, Indiana, businessman parachuted to the ground before letting the plane crash in the Florida panhandle. The craft came down near the Blackwater River, only 50 to 75 yards from homes, said Sgt. Scott Haines of the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office.  Watch more about the mysterious flight » . ""It is a neighborhood -- some very nice waterfront property,"" he said. Military aircraft from Whiting Field, which were dispatched to intercept the plane after Schrenker reported an emergency, witnessed the crash about 9:15 p.m. CT. The crews fired flares and noticed the plane's door was open and the cockpit was dark, Haines said in a news release. They got no response. Haines said the plane appeared to have been put on autopilot at around 2,000 feet, over the Birmingham, Alabama, area, before the pilot parachuted to the ground. Schrenker had contacted air traffic controllers, saying that the windshield imploded. ""The pilot stated that he was bleeding profusely,"" the news release said. ""Radio contact with the plane was not able to be established after that point. When deputies located the plane at the crash site, no blood was present and the door to the plane was open."" The Childersburg, Alabama, Police Department reported that Schrenker approached one of its officers shortly before 2:30 a.m., ""and said that he had been in a canoeing accident with some friends,"" a news release said. Childersburg is about 35 miles southeast of Birmingham. Childersburg officers, unaware of the plane crash, took Schrenker to a hotel in nearby Harpersville. After hearing about the crash, they went back to the hotel, where they found that Schrenker had checked into the hotel under a fictitious name. ""When authorities entered Schrenker's room, he was not there,"" the release said. Authorities said Schrenker checked in under a fake name, put on a black cap and fled into a wooded area. Hotel manager Yogi Patel, who identified Schrenker on surveillance video, told CNN that Schrenker was the only guest overnight. He signed in as Jason Galouzs of Bolingbrook, Illinois, Patel said. A hotel employee said Schrenker went up to his room, but didn't enter before leaving the building. iReport.com: Are you near the crash site? Tell us about it . Steve Darlington, manager of Anderson Municipal Airport, told CNN the plane was in fine condition at takeoff, and said Schrenker is ""an accomplished pilot"" who owns ""a couple of airplanes"" and flies regularly. No agency has come forward to lead the probe. ""The FBI is looking into the matter, along with other agencies,"" said Paul Draymond, of the Birmingham FBI office. Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said several factors indicated the pilot likely left the plane before the crash: a ""detailed review of radar data,"" the fact that the plane was switched to autopilot before it crashed, the sighting by military jet crews and the fact that the cockpit was found mostly intact with no one inside. After the pilot alerted air traffic controllers about the alleged problems with his plane, authorities tried to persuade him to land in Pell City, Alabama, east of Birmingham, Haines said. Schrenker also flew an acrobatic plane, and made a video featured on a YouTube site. A message preceding the video warns, ""No pilot should attempt this stunt. You will get yourself killed. Pilot specially trained to fly unlimited acrobatics and shows."" CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","Authorities say pilot tried to fake his own death by crashing his private plane .

893,"(CNN) -- A rash of inclement weather shut down Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Tuesday morning, raising questions as to whether Super Bowl fans will face travel problems ahead of Sunday's big game. Icy road conditions on Tuesday forced schools and some government offices to close, while 60 municipal trucks salted and scraped their way through Dallas, Texas, said mayoral spokesman Frank Librio. But forecasters expect the blustery winter weather to leave the region -- and much of the country -- by Thursday, just as the first wave of pigskin enthusiasts are due to arrive. ""We have been planning for this for a whole year,"" Librio said of Sunday's match-up between the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers. ""We'll be ready."" Both teams and their fans are cold weather clubs, accustomed to the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. iReport: Planning for a Super Bowl road trip? But as a massive winter storm sweeps across the nation's heartland, up to 500 Dallas flights are expected to be canceled, said airport spokesman David Magana, making re-bookings difficult for those with early travel plans. With more than 30 states under winter storm warnings or blizzard warnings, air traffic came to a halt in some places. Dallas and Houston in Texas and Chicago, Illinois, are feeling the most impact, said FAA spokeswoman Tammy Jones. Transport personnel had reopened one runway at Dallas-Fort Worth airport by Tuesday afternoon, authorities said. Meanwhile, Dallas Love Field Airport was down to one open runway, according to the FAA. Forecasters say the sub-freezing temperatures will let up Friday, reaching highs of 42 degrees. But Super Bowl XLV, scheduled to begin Sunday at 6:30pm ET, is expected to draw thousands of fans to the Texan gridiron in search of warmer weather. Forecasters say Dallas temperatures will bump up to a high of 61 degrees by game day. While not exactly balmy conditions, the warm weather Super Bowl tradition could more abruptly end three years from now. The New Meadowlands Stadium, co-owned by the New York Giants and Jets, won the bid to host Super Bowl XLVIII in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Fans may be forced to don winter gloves underneath their foam fingers in what could be the nation's first true cold-weather classic in 2014. The big game is customarily played in either domed stadiums or warm weather states. The 1967 ""Ice-Bowl,"" in which the Packers edged out a 21-17 win over the Dallas Cowboys, was played in frigid temperatures at Lambeau Field in the 35th National Football League championship game. Green Bay then traveled to Los Angeles to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs 35-10 in the very first Super Bowl.","Icy weather in Dallas is raising questions over whether Super Bowl fans will face travel problems .

894,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When a grenade bounced off his chest and fell to the floor near his fellow troops, Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Monsoor acted out of instinct. His actions didn't stem from a lack of training. His instant reaction was to protect his comrades. The Navy says he committed a selfless act: jumping on the grenade and taking the full force of the blast. President Bush presented Monsoor's parents with a posthumous Medal of Honor for their son at an emotional White House ceremony on Tuesday.  Watch Monsoor's sister share her memories » . Bush quoted one of the SEALS saved by Monsoor as saying, ""Mikey looked death in the face that day and said, 'You cannot take my brothers. I will go in their stead.'""  Watch the president bestow the award » . Monsoor was one of the U.S. military's most highly trained combatants, a Navy SEAL. He's the first SEAL to receive the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq. On September 29, 2006, Monsoor was part of a major clearing and isolating operation to root out enemy fighters holding parts of Ramadi, the Sunni insurgent stronghold west of Baghdad. Monsoor was in a sniper position on a rooftop along with two other SEALs when a grenade flew into his location from out of nowhere. It bounced off his chest and landed in an area where it probably would have killed or seriously wounded all three of them. Monsoor was in a position to escape before the explosion but instead leapt on the grenade. ""He recognized immediately the threat, yelled 'grenade' and due to the fact that two other SEAL snipers, our brothers, could not possibly escape the blast, he chose to smother it with his body, absorbed the impact and lost his life in the process,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Seth Stone, Mansoor's platoon commander. The blast did not kill him right away; he hung on for 30 minutes. His two comrades were wounded but survived the shrapnel that ripped through their bodies. Stone said: ""He essentially saved [the] Navy SEALS on the rooftop and three Iraqi soldiers who were there."" Until this month, when the White House announced that Monsoor would receive the Medal of Honor posthumously, few people knew of his story. Born in 1981 in Long Beach, California, Monsoor excelled as a high school athlete. He joined the Navy before the September 11 attacks. In 2004, Monsoor graduated from the basic SEAL training course as one of the top members of his class. By March 2005, he had completed his training and was assigned to SEAL Team 3, Delta Platoon. In April 2006, that unit deployed to Iraq's troubled and violent western provincial capital of Ramadi. Monsoor would not return home alive. His five-month stay in Ramadi was marked by constant attacks. As a heavy machine gunner, Monsoor had to stay behind the point man on foot patrols and protect the unit from attacks. Delta Platoon was involved in attacks on 75 percent of its missions in a highly contested part of Ramadi called the Ma'laab district, according to the Navy. On a patrol less than a month after arriving in Iraq, Monsoor showed some of his selfless instinct when gunfire hit a fellow SEAL in the leg. Monsoor ""ran out into the street with another SEAL, shot cover fire and dragged his comrade to safety while enemy bullets kicked up the concrete at their feet,"" according to Navy documents. He received the Silver Star, the third highest award for valor in combat. His unit continued to endure the constant barrage of attacks and some 35 firefights with insurgent forces over the scorching Iraqi summer. Monsoor also was saddled with carrying heavy radio equipment on his back as the ""SEAL communicator"" who called in tank and other support during firefights. He received the Bronze Star for his work as an adviser for Iraqi troops. ""His leadership, guidance and decisive actions during 11 different combat operations saved the lives of his teammates, other [U.S.-led] coalition forces and Iraqi army soldiers,"" according to Navy documents. But it was his instinct on his last operation on that Ramadi roof that solidified Monsoor's standing as a hero.

895,"(CNN) -- Airlines canceled thousands of flights for a second day and began to regroup as a historic winter storm pushed through the upper Midwest and into the Northeast on Wednesday. O'Hare International Airport was expected to have limited or no flight operations as up to two feet of snow was forecast to fall on the Windy City, said Karen Pride, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of Aviation. More than 1,300 flights were canceled on Tuesday. At Chicago's Midway Airport, airlines canceled flight operations on Tuesday. The carriers expect to begin operating again on Wednesday afternoon, although most weren't likely to resume before evening, Pride said. Both Chicago airports remained open despite the grounding of flights. Hundreds of cots were made available to passengers stranded by the storm, according to Pride. Some concessions were to remain open to accommodate them. Airlines canceled more than 4,000 flights on Tuesday as the massive storm surged out of the southern Plains, spreading snow and ice from Texas into the Ohio Valley. ""It's going to take days to clear out this storm,"" said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. ""This is a monster."" It was also slow going at other airports. Dallas-Fort Worth International reopened late Tuesday morning after shutting down for several hours because of ice, spokesman David Magana said. American Airlines canceled about 1,900 flights for Tuesday, 800 of those at Dallas-Forth Worth alone. The carrier is also scrubbing more than 1,000 flights for Wednesday. American Airlines is allowing travelers who are scheduled to fly on Monday through Thursday from more than 30 airports in the Midwest -- including those in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- to change their plans without penalty. Southwest Airlines canceled more than 900 flights on Tuesday, according to spokeswoman Marilee McInnis, who said hundreds of flights will likely be grounded for Wednesday. Passengers with reservations for travel through Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit and other cities are eligible to reschedule their flights. AirTran Airways scrubbed 185 flights for Tuesday and has canceled another 75 flights on Wednesday, spokesman Christopher White said. AirTran passengers traveling through two dozen cities in the region -- including Chicago, St. Louis and Boston -- can change their reservation without penalty. Delta Air Lines canceled 625 flights for Tuesday and was grounding at least 800 more for Wednesday. Ahead of the storm, Delta issued a winter weather advisory for the northern United States. Passengers traveling to airports in 20 states through Friday can reschedule their itineraries without a fee or get a refund if their flights are canceled or significantly delayed. Continental Airlines, which canceled 650 flights, will allow changes for travel to, through and from nearly three dozen airports, including the airline's hubs in Newark in New Jersey and Cleveland for travelers scheduled to fly through Thursday. Continental said operations at Newark airport would be suspended through noon Wednesday. US Airways has also relaxed its change-fee policies for passengers scheduled to fly through Thursday to or from 27 cities from Portland, Maine, to Akron, Ohio. Travelers on JetBlue flights to and from six cities and metropolitan areas in the Northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday will also be able to change their plans with no fees. United Airlines, which canceled 800 flights, has issued travel waivers for passengers traveling to, from or through 19 states in the Midwest and Northeast as well as five Canadian cities.

896,"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Flights into Thailand have been thrown into chaos Wednesday after explosions at two Bangkok airports wounded four people and triggered the closure of its main international gateway -- a major hub in the region for travelers, authorities said. Passengers face a long wait inside Suvarnabhumi airport with most flights canceled. The blasts come a day after thousands of anti-government protesters stormed the airports to protest the return of Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat from the APEC summit in Peru. One blast occurred at Suvarnabhumi Airport at 5 a.m. (2200 Tuesday GMT), an airport official said. One person was wounded in that attack. Continued protests caused authorities to cancel all incoming and outgoing flights there, an assistant to airport director Serirat Prasutanond told CNN. Three protesters also entered the airport's control tower, demanding the prime minister's flight schedule, The Associated Press quoted Group Capt. Chokchai Saranon, a control tower official, as saying. As the airport had been shut down, there were no controllers in the tower, AP reported.  Watch what's behind protesters' demands » . The other blast occurred at 6:40 a.m. Wednesday (2340 Tuesday GMT) at the Don Muang International Airport, wounding three people, police said. Suvarnabhumi Airport later canceled all flights, AP reported. On Tuesday thousands of anti-government protesters partially shut down Suvarnabhumi Airport, the country's main airport, an airport spokesman said.  Watch fists fly in the terminal » . Pro- and anti-government protesters also exchanged gunfire, a Thai police official said. Protesters with golf clubs and long wooden sticks also clashed with airport taxi drivers, with each side throwing things at the other. The clash started when the anti-government group People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) was mobilizing supporters near the Don Muang airport, which the government is using as its temporary office. iReport.com: Are you there? Send pics, video . The PAD ran into a pro-government group, resulting in an exchange of abusive words, and the pro-government group threw rocks into the PAD crowd prompting an exchange of gunfire, the police official said. The PAD has been leading protests against the government since May, accusing the government of being a front for ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Protesters surrounded the parliament building on Monday, forcing lawmakers to postpone their session. Thaksin was ousted in a bloodless coup in 2006, only to return after the People Power Party won elections in December 2007 . He left again in August of this year, shortly before he was to face trial on corruption charges. In October Thailand's Supreme Court ruled that Thaksin had abused his powers while in office and sentenced the absent former leader to two years in prison. The case was one of several lodged against Thaksin, who protesters want to return to Thailand to face trial. Thaksin stayed in the United Kingdom for much of this year before British authorities revoked his visa. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report. Copyright 2008 CNN.

897,"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Final preparations are being made for the funeral Monday of slain Irish newlywed Michaela Harte-McAreavey. The 27-year-old was found strangled in her hotel room on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius last Monday. She was killed less than two weeks after her wedding. Her funeral will take place Monday afternoon at the church where she married Gaelic footballer John McAreavey on December 30. The president of the Republic of Ireland, Mary McAleese, will head dignitaries among thousands expected to attend a requiem mass at St. Malachy's Church, Ballymacilroy, Northern Ireland. The Catholic primate of all Ireland, Cardinal Sean Brady, will be among senior clerics at a service led by McAreavey's uncle Bishop John McAreavey, who married the couple two and a half weeks ago. Hundreds of people attended Harte-McAreavey's wake at the Harte family home in County Tyrone over the weekend. Three suspects in her death are all employees of the luxury hotel where the newlywed was found strangled, according to the Mauritius Police Force. Room attendant Avinash Treebhoowoon, 29, and Sandip Moneea, 41, a floor supervisor, have been charged with murder. Room attendant Raj Theekoy, 33, faces a conspiracy charge. Police said one of the men has confessed and participated in the reconstruction. Authorities believe the men were inside the teacher's hotel room when she returned alone. ""We presume they were inside and burgling the room when the lady returned and were surprised and attacked her,"" Mauritius police Superintendent Yoosoof Soopun, who is leading the investigation, said last week. Authorities said the killer used an electronic key card to enter the room. The former beauty queen's husband was in the restaurant of the hotel when his wife was killed, and is not a suspect, Soopun said. An autopsy showed that she died of asphyxiation. Harte-McAreavey taught Irish at St. Patrick's Academy in Dungannon, County Tyrone, in Northern Ireland. She won the Ulster Rose of Tralee contest and participated in other beauty pageants. She was the daughter of Tyrone Gaelic football manager Mickey Harte.","Michaela Harte-McAreavey was strangled while on her honeymoon in Mauritius .

898,"(CNN) -- Tennis superstar Roger Federer is hoping to help the victims of the Australian floods by setting up a fund-raising event this weekend. Rising waters in Queensland have left the state's premier warning of ""the worst natural disaster in our history"" as homes have been flooded and power cut off in the capital city Brisbane. Federer, who is in Melbourne preparing to begin the defense of his Australian Open title next week, set up a similar exhibition following the Haiti earthquakes a year ago. ""The floods here in Australia are devastating! I am on my way to practice now and am going to speak with Tennis Australia to see if we perhaps can organize something on Sunday to help raise some funds for the people of Queensland who have been affected,"" Federer said on his Facebook page on Wednesday. ""Stay tuned as it would be great if the sport of tennis can help out right before the Australian Open begins."" Tense waiting game for Brisbane residents . The 29-year-old Swiss player supports several charities, having launched his own foundation in 2003 to help disadvantaged children. He and tennis rival Rafael Nadal raised $2.6 million in the first of two offseason charity matches in Zurich in December. He also visited tsunami victims as part of his role as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Tennis stars have already contributed to the Queensland disaster fund, with American Andy Roddick donating $10,800 after reaching the final of the tournament in Brisbane last weekend. Australian star Samantha Stosur also made a donation, and Roddick's website reported that the men's and women's ATP and WTA ruling bodies would pledge $10 for every ace serve hit by their players in Brisbane, Sydney this week and the Australian Open.","Queensland has been hit by rising flood waters in the past week or so .

899,"(CNN) -- A Texas produce distributor has recalled nearly 7,000 cases of cilantro and curly parsley after samples in Quebec, Canada, and Michigan tested positive for salmonella, the company said Monday. The latest recall comes days after dozens of people fell sick after consuming bacteria-tainted alfalfa sprouts in an apparently unrelated situation. The ""precautionary, voluntary recall"" announced Monday pertains to cilantro and parsley from J&D Produce, Inc., packed between November 30 and December 6, the Edinburg, Texas-based company said in a statement. Cilantro and parsley processed and branded as Little Bear between those dates can be taken to retailers for a full refund. No one has reported getting sick from eating the vegetables, according to J&D Produce. Also Monday, the Food and Drug Administration announced a source of a salmonella outbreak that had sickened at least 89 people in 15 states and the District of Columbia. Health officials said those first cases became known November 1, with many getting ill after eating alfalfa sprouts in products from Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches outlets. The FDA said Monday that those vegetables came from Tiny Greens Organic Farm. Tiny Greens' alfalfa sprouts and spicy sprouts (which have alfalfa sprouts plus radish and clover sprouts) were distributed in 4-ounce and 5-pound containers to farmers' markets, grocery stores and restaurants including Jimmy John's. In addition to a variety of sprouts, the Urbana, Illinois, produce company distributes arugula, broccoli, fennel, cauliflower, onion, radish and other items, according to its website. In a letter to Jimmy John's franchisees, founder Jimmy John Liautaud said that the chain had pulled sprouts from all its Illinois establishments after store locations came up negative for the bacteria. About 23% of those sickened in that outbreak were hospitalized, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last Thursday. No deaths have been linked to the outbreak. The FDA said Monday that the sprouts were distributed in Indiana, Iowa, Missouri and possibly other Midwestern states, with roughly half the illnesses occurring in Illinois. The separate J&D Produce recall, meanwhile, came after independent tests found salmonella on the company's parsley in Quebec and its cilantro in Detroit, Michigan, both of which came from the same processing line in Texas. The company's products are sold retail as well as to wholesalers, who may then distribute them to restaurants and other establishments, according to Sharon McNerney, a public relations consultant for the company. The recall involves 2,498 cases of the parsley -- which have expiration dates 12 days after being packed -- that went out to the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario and the U.S. states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The 4,411 recalled cases of cilantro, carrying the same packing and expiration dates, were distributed in Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin as well as Quebec and Ontario . After the positive results, regulators and health officials in the United States and Canada have stepped up inspections of J&D Produce's facilities, the company's president, James Bassetti, said. They also undertook other measures, including stopping and sanitizing all production lines, adding manual inspections, rinsing products more and bringing in consultants. ""We have a good track record, but we'll bring our expectations and standards to even higher levels,"" he said. ""We've already begun improving our systems."" In addition to cilantro and parsley, the Texas company gathers, packs and distributes a variety of fruits and vegetables such as carrots, limes, eggplants, peppers, greens, onions, melons, mangos and asparagus, according to its website. Those with questions can call J&D Produce at 956-380-0353. Salmonella is a bacterial infection that usually lasts four to seven days. About 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported each year in the United States, according to the CDC. Those who get it typically develop fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea between 12 and 72 hours after becoming infected. Most people recover on their own, without needing significant treatment. But salmonella in very young and very old people, as well as those with weakened immune systems, can lead to severe illness and even death. The CDC recommends that anyone suspecting he or she may be ill from eating contaminated food should talk to a doctor.","NEW: A recall of parsley and cilantro affects 14 states and 2 Canadian provinces .

900,"(CNN) -- A small plane landed on a New Jersey highway on Monday, fire officials said. The two-seater craft was heading toward an airport in Teterboro, New Jersey, but instead touched down on Interstate 80 in Hackensack, New Jersey, after the pilot reported a loss of fuel pressure, said the city's fire chief, Thomas Freeman. There were no reports of injuries. Authorities closed one highway lane as emergency vehicles towed the plane alongside the beginnings of rush-hour traffic.","A plane lands on Interstate 80 in Hackensack after the pilot reports a loss of fuel pressure .

901,"(CNN) -- Medical workers expressed alarm Friday over the increase in hospitalizations and deaths in Haiti's cholera outbreak as the earthquake-devastated nation's already strained health system overflowed with the sick. On the outskirts of the capital city of Port-au-Prince in the slum of Cite Soleil, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) saw 216 cases of cholera at Choscal Hospital on Thursday. Five days ago, that number was only 30. Stefano Zannini, the head of mission for Medecins Sans Frontieres, said his staff was seeing seven times the cases they were seeing three days ago. ""The trend is extremely, extremely alarming,"" he said. ""We have not reached a peak yet, but it could arrive next week."" The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs put the death toll Friday at more than 800, with more than 12,000 people hospitalized. Epidemiologists predict the outbreak could last for months and say the entire nation of almost 10 million people is at risk because they have no immunity to cholera. The United Nations warned that Haiti is facing one of the most severe outbreaks of the disease in the past 100 years. It appealed to international donors for $164 million in aid and said it anticipates as many as 200,000 people to be sickened with cholera over the next six to 12 months. ""A major effort has already been made, but the sheer quantity of relief items that need to be delivered in the days and weeks ahead is going to require more logistical and financial support for the government by all humanitarian agencies and donors and very close coordination,"" said Nigel Fisher, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Haiti. ""Without this the epidemic could well outrun our efforts."" Of grave concern are cases that originated in the tent cities of Port-au-Prince, which sprang up to shelter those left homeless by the massive earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people last January. Health officials fear that infection could spread quickly in the makeshift cities' congested, unsanitary conditions and in impoverished neighborhoods where clean drinking water is at a premium. Symptoms of cholera, an acute, bacterial illness caused by drinking tainted water, can be mild or even non-existent. But sometimes they can be severe: profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps, which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration, shock and death. Aid workers in Haiti are scrambling as the nation recovers not only from the earthquake, but from last week's hurricane. ""We are stretched thin,"" said Julie Schindall, a spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency Oxfam. Zannini reminded the world that cholera is as much a logistical problem as a medical one. It's not just a matter of medical donations or more doctors on the ground, he said. Who will supply clean drinking water? Who will make sure there are proper bathroom facilities? Who will dispose of the waste? Or for that matter, the dead bodies? ""It's not just about donating money,"" Zannini said.

902,"(CNN) -- Professional kiteboarder Sean Reyngoudt is unique -- and it is not just the dangerous stunts he performs that set him apart. ""I'll be out there doing all my tricks and everything -- having a good time and then I come in to the beach and people realize that I'm missing my leg and they are totally shocked by it,"" says Reyngoudt. Reyngoudt, 27, is an amputee. About eight years ago, he fell off a forklift and the accident caused him to lose his left leg just below the knee. Before the accident, Reyngoudt had played football, baseball, soccer and ran track for his high school team. His mother Esthi Reyngoudt was devastated when she saw her son after the surgery. ""I just saw my kid without a leg and thought that he would sit around on the couch and he wouldn't be able to do anything anymore,"" she said. That thought did not last long, since her son was back in the water swimming before he was even fitted for his prosthesis. ""When I first got my prosthesis, that made a huge difference,"" says Reyngoudt, ""I was running out of their office."" He hasn't stopped running since. It was soon after when Reyngoudt took up extreme sports like kiteboarding and wakeboarding. His dedication and perseverance had Reyngoudt exceeding all expectation and his talent landed him a spot on the Best Kiteboarding Team. He now competes solo. Fellow professional kiteboarder Matt Sexton agrees that it is Reyngoudt's abilities and not his unique status as the only professional amputee that earns him respect. ""He's beaten us a lot of times in races and freestyle stuff,"" says Sexton. ""It's motivating for us as much as it is for people sharing the same problems as his."" Reyngoudt says he doesn't view his amputation as a problem. He says he looks at it as more of a challenge -- one that he appears to have overcome. ""We actually have a poster of Sean up in the shop, riding,"" says Mike Walsh, owner of Otherside Boardsports a sponsor of Reyngoudt. ""Unless you look close, it's just a sick picture of a kiteboarder doing a nice trick."" Walsh didn't look close when he first met Reyngoudt. He says Reyngoudt must have been wearing long pants when he first started coming into his shop because it took months until Walsh noticed his leg. It was Reyngoudt's talent that Walsh first noticed. ""It is a disability, but I don't think he's by any means disabled."" ""I don't have a disabled parking sticker on my car, I enjoy walking far away from the store,"" Reyngoudt says. ""It doesn't bother me."" Referring to him as disabled doesn't bother him either, says Reyngoudt. ""I think what every amputee should do is to just take full advantage of what you have. And live life every day as you can and enjoy it."" Reyngoudt and his friends enjoy spending every minute they can out on the water where he isn't treated any different. Walsh says, ""It just takes an extra minute to get ready, but other than that, he's just one of the boys."" Getting treated like and acting like one of the boys is exactly what his mother hoped for after her son's accident. Offering advice to other families of amputees, Esthi Reyngoudt says, ""You got to encourage them to get up every day and do what they did before and not give up. Because it's not the end of the world. It's your attitude that keeps you going."" It's Reyngoudt's attitude that has put him in the unique position of being the only professional kiteboarder that happens to be an amputee. ""He's an excellent ambassador for the sport,"" and that has nothing to do with his leg, says Walsh, and everything to do with ""his personality, his perseverance, his commitment, his loyalty.""","Sean Reyngoudt is a professional kiteboarder, which includes dangerous stunts .

903,"(CNN) -- Firefighters battled bushfires in and around Perth in Western Australia on Monday, emergency officials said. The raging flames have destroyed at least 59 homes, Sally Bowery with CNN affiliate Seven Network reported, citing fire authorities. Western Australia's premier, Colin Barnett, said that the severity of the fire damage was bad enough that he has declared a natural disaster in the Perth's hills region. The declaration means residents can qualify for emergency accommodation, food, essential clothing and other personal items, temporary living expenses, housing repairs and replacement of household furniture. Fire and Emergency Services Authority (FESA) officials declared a total fire ban for ""Perth, Perth hills and surrounding areas, Mandurah, inland parts of the Central Wheatbelt and the Central West."" The flames are being fanned by 75 kph (47 mph) winds. An initial investigation indicates the fire was accidentally started from sparks caused by a person using an angle grinder.","Investigators believe the fire was accidentally started .

904,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Nine crew members aboard the French speed sailing trimaran l'Hydroptere were injured on Sunday when the boat flipped while traveling at more than 60 knots (over 110 kilometers an hour) off the southern coast of France. Capsized: French trimaran l'Hydroptere floats upside-down after flipping in high winds Sunday. The boat, which is the world's fastest yacht over one nautical mile, has been trying to claim the world outright speed sailing record, which would require an average speed of 60 miles per hour (about 52 knots or 96 kilometers per hour) over 500 meters. The current record is held by French kite surfer Alexandre Caizergues who managed an average speed of 50.57 knots. Sunday's accident occurred in heavy wind gusts of over 45 knots off Napoléon beach at Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhône, near Marseille. View photos of the capsized boat » . A statement from the l'Hydroptere team said the nine crew members had sustained minor injuries when an unexpectedly strong squall hit the boat and capsized it. All of the crew had escaped serious injury and rescue crews on standby managed to pick them up from the water. A spokeswoman from the team told CNN it was understood the mast may have been broken, which could put the boat out of action for several months. • Read more about the intense race to become the fastest boat on the planet. The team skipper Alain Thebault and his crew had organized for the trimaran to be towed to shore and moored in Fos sur Mer, before being put in dry dock to assess the damage. The spokeswoman said conditions were too rough to remove the boat from the water on Sunday, so it was hoped this would be done Monday afternoon. Despite the injuries, the crew were delighted to have achieved speeds of more than 60 knots, as it had confirmed the boat's potential, the spokeswoman said. It was understood that no other vessels as large as l'Hydroptere had managed to pass the 60 knots barrier.

905,"(CNN) -- Flames danced hundreds of feet in the east Texas sky hours after a fire broke out at a natural gas and chemical facility. There were no injuries reported at the fire in Mont Belvieu, about 35 miles east of Houston, said Rick Rainey, a spokesman for Enterprise Products. A worker who was unaccounted for was believed to be away from the site, but the company was conducting a search, Rainey said. The fire broke out shortly after noon at a facility used to store natural gas liquids. The cause was not known. A two-mile perimeter was cleared around the plant. A nearby school restricted outdoor activities. ""The plant is within five miles of the school and according to the emergency command center, there is no indication that the fire is of a toxic nature, since they believe the fuel driving the flame is natural gas,"" said Barbers Hill Superintendent Greg Poole. ""Additionally, the wind is blowing away from us."" ""We don't believe this is a safety issue,"" Poole said. ""However, we do have a lot of parents here at the school who are employees over at Enterprise, so that's caused a lot of concern for us here."" According to its website, Enterprise Products owns or has interest in approximately 19,200 miles of onshore natural gas pipelines that provide for the gathering and transmission of natural gas in Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming.

The bus was traveling to Raleigh, North Carolina, when the gun-toting passenger approached the driver Thursday night, said Maureen Richmond, a Greyhound spokeswoman. The passenger screamed for the driver to pull over. The driver did. Thirty-three of passengers were allowed to get off the bus at that time, according to Vance County Sheriff Peter White. The driver, the gunman and the two remaining passengers then continued on to a nearby gas station where police were waiting. The suspect, identified as Jose Flores, was shocked with a stun gun and then arrested, said White. Flores faces a charge of one count of kidnapping, said Capt.

908,"London (CNN) -- The hijacking of a U.S.-bound oil tanker carrying 2 million barrels of crude on Wednesday marks what one shipping official calls ""significant shift in the impact of the piracy crisis,"" with major oil lines to the West under severe threat. Pirates seized the MV Irene SL, a Greek supertanker, in the afternoon -- marking the second such incident in two days. They occurred in the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean where hijacking have become commonplace in recent years. The European Union Naval Force said the Irene departed Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates and was destined for the Egyptian port of Suez in the North Arabian Sea when it was attacked. But the force doesn't always report the final destination. Joe Angelo, managing director of the trade association INTERTANKO, citing the owner, Enesel S.A., said the ship was ultimately headed for the U.S. gulf. ""The hijacking by pirates of 2 million barrels of Kuwaiti crude oil destined for the U.S. in a large Greek tanker in the middle of the main sea lanes coming from the Middle East Gulf marks a significant shift in the impact of the piracy crisis in the Indian Ocean,"" Angelo told CNN. ""If piracy in the Indian Ocean is left unabated, it will strangle these crucial shipping lanes with the potential to severely disrupt oil flows to the U.S. and to the rest of the world."" The Wednesday incident took place about 350 nautical miles southeast of the Omani city of Muscat in the North Arabian Sea. The crew consists of 17 Filipinos, seven Greeks, and a Georgian. A Greek Merchant Marine Ministry spokesman said the ship was carrying 266,000 tons of crude oil. There has been no communication with the ship, officials from Greece and the European Union Naval Force said. On Tuesday, the MV Savina Caylyn, an Italian-flagged oil tanker, was headed from Sudan to Malaysia when five people on a skiff launched a ""sustained attack"" on the tanker with small arms and rocket propelled grenades and then got on the ship. The naval force also said on Wednesday it received reports that the Golden Wave, a South Korean fishing vessel seized in October off the Kenyan coast, has been released from pirate control. The condition of the 43 crew members are not known, but the naval force says ""they are in need of food, water and medical aid.""

910,"(CNN) -- A lot gets carried in a plane's cargo hold, but US Airways is still against people, especially those still on the clock. A baggage handler at Reagan National Airport in Washington was found locked in a US Airways plane's cargo hold before takeoff Monday, said Laura J. Brown with the Federal Aviation Administration. Employees were searching for their co-worker when banging was heard outside the fuselage, she said. While loading a departing flight, the employee watched from inside the cargo hold as a co-worker closed the forward bin door from outside. According to the FAA, within ""a matter of minutes,"" a third employee arrived and questioned where the baggage handler was, because the handler also was expected to tug the plane away from the gate. Upon opening his window, the first officer reportedly heard banging coming from inside the plane. The worker was released and went on to operate the tug. The plane departed ahead of schedule. Republic Airlines Flight 3336, listed as a US Airways flight, had 29 passengers on board and very few checked bags, Brown said. Liz Landau, a spokeswoman for US Airways said, ""The engines never started and (the plane) never left the gate."" It is not uncommon for baggage handlers to enter a cargo hold as part of their job, Landau said. An investigation by US Airways is under way.

911,"(CNN) -- An electrical outage at a power station in northern New Jersey left 20,000 households -- and a major airport -- without power Monday, prompting authorities to restrict incoming and outgoing flights at Newark International Airport, officials said. Several people were removed from stalled elevators, while others were stranded in the airport's monorail trains, according to a spokesman for the Port Authority for New York and New Jersey. The outage occurred around 2:30 p.m. after an equipment failure at Bayway Switching Station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, according to Public Service Electric and Gas Co. spokeswoman Bonnie Sheppard. Power was restored at Newark airport around 4 p.m., and flights resumed with minor delays. Emergency crews were working to restore service across the region, Sheppard said.","NEW: Power was restored at Newark aiport around 4 p.m.

912,"Teresopolis, Brazil (CNN) -- It was like a tsunami from the sky in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state as floodwater gushed through hill towns and giant boulders catapulted from hillsides, instantly crushing cars and houses. At least 540 people have been killed and another 10,000 people living in what used to be picturesque mountain towns popular with tourists have been affected by the torrential rains that began at the start of the year, civil defense authorities told the official Agencia Brasil news agency. Rescuers have not been able to reach some hard-hit areas and many more people are feared dead, the agency said. Conditions were so treacherous that rescue teams called it quits Thursday night and resumed their search and recovery work Friday morning. The rain is predicted to continue for several days in areas already submerged in water or slathered with mud. Thousands of families are still living on mountain slopes or on riverbanks and face extreme risk of being washed away. One resident described the disaster as a tsunami that fell from the sky. Chaos reigned in the especially hard-hit city of Teresopolis, where some residents donned masks and helped clean streets or deliver first aid. Others combed the city, searching desperately for missing loved ones. Schools and police stations turned into overflowing morgues, where people waited to identify their family and friends. Municipal worker Reginald de Oliveira came to see if he could find the body of his uncle, missing in the floods. He was trying to save his family when a wall of water washed him away. Red Cross volunteer Maria Helena de Jesus was helping with first aid. ""You have to almost have a heart of stone,"" she said. ""It was very difficult."" Teresopolis Mayor Jorge Mario Sedlacek declared his city a natural disaster area. At least 229 people died in Teresopolis, while 246 were killed in the town of Nova Friburgo, Agencia Brasil reported. President Dilma Rousseff flew over flood-affected areas Thursday and landed in a slushy, trash-littered soccer field in Friburgo, the agency said. The floods are her first test as president. She trudged through mud in her rain boots to talk to residents in a neighborhood where four of seven firefighters attempting to rescue people had been buried under mud. Three others were pulled out alive. ""We are going to take firm action,"" to help the devastated areas, said Rousseff, who assumed office at the first of the year. Brazilian authorities have been criticized for a lack of disaster planning and allowing people to build homes in areas known to become treacherous in the rainy season. They are under increasing pressure to show a strong response. Brazil is scheduled to host the World Cup in 2014 and the 2016 Olympics. The roofs of houses and treetops peeked out from the water. People used inflatable rafts or inner tubes to navigate submerged roads. One family sat perched on the roof of their house, their predicament broadcast on television. Another person grasped onto a rope, defying, at least momentarily, the force of an ocean of murky brown water. With more rain forecast, Brazilian authorities have ordered evacuations for at least 5,000 families living in especially perilous areas in Rio de Janeiro state, Agencia Brasil said. Another 3,000 families from a mountainous region were homeless and sheltered in schools and gymnasiums, the news agency said. ""The most important thing right now is to assist the homeless population and reach the most critical points,"" said Rodrigo Neves, the state secretary of Social Welfare and Human Rights. State health officials pleaded for people to donate blood that will be sent to the Serrana region, where only 36 units of blood remained for treatment of flood victims. Rain has affected neighboring Sao Paulo as well, killing 24 people there, authorities said.

913,"(CNN)  -- Ricky Ponting looks set to lead Australia into the Boxing Day Test against England at the MCG despite a broken finger. Ponting came through a batting practice session in Melbourne on Friday, spending about half an hour in the indoor nets before venturing outside to further test the injury. The 36-year-old suffered the mishap to the little finger of his left hand as he attempted to catch a ball on the final day of his side's triumph in the third Test in Perth. The victory leveled the five-match series at 1-1, making the Christmas clash all the more important. Is Australia's one-day reign set to end in 2011 ? Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke is confident Ponting will be fit to play on Sunday. ""We are all very hopeful and pretty confident that unless they cut his finger off, it is going to be really hard to leave 'Punter' out,"" he told gathered reporters. ""I think he is going to have to wait until tomorrow to see how it pulls up after having a bat today, but he is pretty happy with how things went."" The uncapped Usman Khawaja has been added to the Australian squad as cover for Ponting. Meanwhile, England's injury worry James Anderson also appears to be winning his fitness battle. The 28-year-old pace bowler suffered a side strain in the defeat in Perth, but came through an hour-long net session Friday. Australia level series with crushing Perth win . ""Jimmy seems absolutely fine,"" said captain Andrew Strauss. ""He's done quite a lot of bowling, but it (the side strain) has settled down nicely."" Anderson's fitness is key to England's hopes, the tourists having already lost fellow fast bowler Stuart Broad for the rest of the series due to injury. Organizers at the MCG are expecting an official Test record 91,000 crowd for the first day of the match.","Australian captain Ricky Ponting comes unscathed through practice session on Friday .

914,"Baghdad (CNN) -- A wave of bombings left 51 people dead and more than 120 wounded Thursday in various Baghdad neighborhoods, including one in which angry residents later threw stones at security forces, the Interior Ministry said. At least 48 people were killed and 121 wounded when a parked car bomb detonated near a funeral tent in the predominantly Shiite neighborhood of Shula in northwestern Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said. After the Shula bombing, people threw rocks at security forces, the official told CNN, and some people fired guns. Security forces withdrew until an Iraqi Army unit dispersed the crowds by shooting in the air and imposing a partial curfew in Shula, the official said. The gathering of the crowd reflects the growing frustration and anger against the government and security forces, especially by the country's Shiites, who have come under intensive attacks in recent days. Iraq has witnessed in the past 10 days constant high-profile attacks, mainly targeting Shiites and security forces, that have claimed the lives of more than 200 people. Some 151 people were killed in the entire month of December. Attacks on security forces in Tikrit and Diyala were claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq. There was no claim of responsibility for attacks on the Shiites. Officials have blamed al Qaeda and other Sunni extremist groups of carrying out these attacks in an attempt to reignite the sectarian war that gripped Iraq for years. Many Iraqis blame their security forces for not preventing these attacks and question the abilities of these forces to secure the country, especially as the U.S. military prepares for a complete troop withdrawal by the end of this year. Many have blamed the deteriorating security situation on politicians still not agreeing on key security posts that remain vacant in the government formed more than a month ago. Meanwhile, three people died in three other attacks in the Iraqi capital. A roadside bomb exploded next to a police patrol in southern Baghdad, killing a civilian and wounding seven people, including three police officers. In another attack in southeastern Baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded near a government convoy. It missed the convoy but killed one civilian and wounded three others. In central Baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded on a busy road, killing one civilian and wounding four. The blasts came after Wednesday night's assassination of three government employees by gunmen using pistols equipped with silencers in three neighborhoods in Baghdad. Two of the three government employees worked at Iraq's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the third employee worked at the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction.","NEW: Angry citizens throw stones at security forces .

916,"New York (CNN) -- Three people who contracted cholera at a wedding in the Dominican Republic before returning to New York have recovered, and the risk of their infecting anyone else is low, officials said Sunday. None of the three adults had to be hospitalized, said Erin Hughes, spokeswoman for New York City's health department. Person-to-person transmission of the disease is highly unlikely, Hughes told CNN in an e-mail. ""Cholera is spread by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacteria. This happens in places with inadequate water treatment and poor sanitation. New York City's water is clean and safe."" On average, one case a year of cholera is reported in New York, she said, and it is ""almost always in someone who has traveled abroad."" The Centers for Disease Control will test samples to confirm the illness and determine from which strain the people were sickened, said CDC spokeswoman Candice Burns Hoffman. Cholera is a ""nationally notifiable"" disease, she said, and samples from all suspected U.S. cases are sent to the CDC for lab testing and confirmation. The Dominican Republic is investigating the outbreak at the wedding, Hoffman said. ""It's not uncommon for cholera outbreaks, like the one that has moved rapidly through Haiti, to spread to other countries,"" Hoffman said. ""We have seen a few cases in travelers returning to the U.S. The risk for secondary infection in the U.S. is low.""","The 3 adults were guests at a wedding in the Dominican Republic .

917,"(CNN) -- Robert Kubica's Lotus-Renault team said Monday that the F1 star was ""much better"" after undergoing emergency surgery in an Italian hospital following his crash while competing in a motor rally. The 26-year-old Pole spent the night in an induced coma after a seven-hour operation to repair multiple fractures to his right arm and hand. Kubica required several transfusions during the procedure to stabilize his condition after losing a lot of blood following the high-speed accident. But in a statement on the team's official website, they said that Kubica had been briefly woken by doctors at the Santa Corona hospital in Pietra Ligure and was able to talk to his relatives. ""He was also able to move his fingers, which is an encouraging sign for the rest of the recovery process,"" it said. Dr. Mario Igor Rosello, the specialist who operated on Kubica, claimed the lack of swelling or infection on his right forearm was also a ""good sign"" but added it will be ""several days before it is known if the operation is 100 per cent successful."" Kubica badly hurt in rallying crash . Kubica suffered multiple fractures to his right arm and leg after hitting a guard rail when he lost control of his Skoda Fabia during the Ronde de Andorra rally in Italy. With the first race of the new Formula One season in Bahrain next month, his Lotus Renault team defended Kubica's decision to take part in a rally so close to the start of the season. ""He loves rallying,"" team boss Eric Boullier told Italian news agency Ansa. ""We knew the risks and so did he. We didn't want a robot or a corporate man for a driver. It was agreed."" Kubica finished 2010 in eighth position and was due to start his fifth campaign as a first-choice driver, but there are now doubts as to whether the former Sauber driver will be fit to play any part in the 2011 campaign. When asked about the length of time it could take for 2008 Canadian Grand Prix winner to recover, Rossello is reported by the BBC to have said, ""One year. One year is the best provision."" Kubica also suffered fractures to his shoulder and elbow and Lotus Renault said the hospital would decide over the next few days if further operations were necessary on these injuries. Support has been offered from throughout the close-knit world of F1 for the only Polish driver to have ever driven at this level, including a specially-designed ""Twibbon"" on the social-networking site Twitter. McLaren's 2009 world champion Jenson Button tweeted, ""Shocking news about Robert Kubica. I wish him a speedy recovery."" Another driver to offer his sympathies was Williams' veteran Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, who used his Twitter blog to say, ""I would like to ask you for your best wishes to Kubica,"" and ""we all like him and he deserves all the best."" If Kubica is unable to take to the grid for the start of the season, Lotus Renault may choose to promote one of their two reserve drivers. The team's two options are Bruno Senna, who raced for HRT in 2010, and Frenchman Romain Grosjean. The 2011 Formula One season is set to get underway at Bahrain's International Circuit on March 13.","NEW: Lotus-Renault say Robert Kubica ""much better"" after his rally crash .

919,"(CNN) -- A tractor-trailer clipped one bus carrying students back from a college visit and then struck another head-on, leaving three dead, Mississippi authorities said Tuesday. A teacher, school bus driver and the driver of the big rig died in the Tuesday afternoon incident near Calhoun City, authorities said. ""I've been doing this for 41 years and this is the worst wreck with this number of people I've seen,"" said Calhoun County Sheriff Billy Gore. ""It's troubling to see so many young kids so so frightened."" The school group was returning from a visit to the University of Mississippi, officials said. Mitchell Diggs, a spokesman for the University of Mississippi, said the group from Ackerman High School in Choctaw County was in Oxford for a typical admissions visit for seniors. The students later took a tour and had lunch before departing the campus around 1 p.m., Diggs said. About 60 children were on the buses, and 10 were transported to area hospitals after the 2:30 p.m. collision, officials said. One patient was airlifted, Gore said. The rest suffered mostly bumps and bruises, he said. The accident happened on state routes 8 and 9, which are combined for several miles. Footage provided by CNN affiliate WMC in Memphis, Tennessee, showed the damaged bus on a narrow bridge. The truck continued a few hundred yards before coming to a stop. Calhoun City is in north central Mississippi. The investigation is continuing. CNN's Craig Bell and Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","NEW: Teacher, bus driver, truck driver are killed in Mississippi wreck, officials say .

921,"(CNN) -- Making the catch was never a life or death matter for Jeff Bryant until a baby dropped from a burning apartment building in a Portland, Oregon, suburb fell into his hands Saturday morning. If Bryant had failed, the boy would have landed on a concrete parking lot. As it was, the child and his mother survived, but two other sons of the mother died in the blaze. Bryant discovered the Milwaukie apartment building was on fire as he walked out the door of his nearby residence around 9:30 a.m. ""I could hear buzzers and saw black smoke as I walked down the alley,"" Bryant told CNN. ""Then I saw a woman hanging out of a fourplex holding a baby in her hands."" Without hesitating, Bryant dumped the coffee cup he was carrying, ran to the building and yelled at the woman to drop the baby to him, he said. ""Are you sure you'll catch him?"" Bryant recalled the woman shouted at him. ""Of course I will,"" Bryant said he replied. ""I knew for a fact that I was not going to drop that baby."" Bryant, who played basketball in the eighth grade, said he wasn't thinking about snagging a rebound. ""It had nothing to do with my hands, it had to with coordination,"" Bryant said. That, said Bryant, and, ""I pictured one of my own children hanging out that window."" The woman, whom authorities identified as Kimberly Hasty, 24, then dropped her 1-year-old son, Wani Lemi, into Bryant's arms. Bryant then ran to the far side of the parking lot to get the child away from the intense heat. Hasty then jumped out of the second-story window of her apartment. Bryant wrapped Wani in a quilt a friend brought to him. He said he then told others who arrived at the scene to take Hasty away from the burning building. ""I was worried the windows were going to explode,"" Bryant said. ""Which they did."" Bryant said the flames were so large they threatened other buildings in the complex, including his own. Bryant said he then told his wife and two children to get out of their apartment. Clackamas Fire District 1 spokesman Steve McAdoo said it took three minutes for firefighters to respond to the blaze. By the time they arrived, the baby and his mother had been rescued and the apartment was engulfed in flames. Two of her other sons -- 4-year-old Ladu Lemi and Appolo Lemi, 5 -- died after firefighters pulled them from the burning apartment building. An autopsy by the Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office found that the boys had died of smoke inhalation. McAdoo said that had Bryant not been there, the blaze could easily have killed all four family members. Hasty and her surviving son were listed in stable critical condition at a nearby hospital, authorities said. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Bryant was reluctant to accept being called a hero. ""I just thought it was the correct thing to do,"" he said. ""If it was me and my child, I would hope a passerby would do the same thing for me.""","NEW: Victims of Portland-area blaze identified .

923,"(CNN) -- Billy Powell, keyboardist with the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, died of a heart ailment at his condo in the Jacksonville, Florida, suburb of Orange Park, police said Thursday. He was 56. Billy Powell, center, poses with other members of Lynyrd Skynyrd at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2006. Powell, who died early Wednesday, had survived the band's October 1977 plane crash in Mississippi that killed lead singer Ronnie Van Zant; guitarist Steve Gaines; Gaines's sister, vocalist Cassie Gaines; an assistant road manager; and the pilot and copilot. Powell was seriously injured in the crash. More than 40 fans left messages on a fan Web site. ""Billy, you are truely free now. Rock on with Ronnie and the gang. You also will be forever missed,"" read a note signed by traceyspruill. ""I cannot believe the hurt that I have felt from being a Skynyrd fan, but I realize that it only hurts so much because I love the members of this band like my own family. We will always miss you, Billy. I can hear your fingertips rolling off those ivory keys right now. Thanks for being you. Rest in peace and may God bless you,"" another fan wrote. According to Orange Park Police Lt. Mark Cornett, Powell called 911 around midnight Tuesday from his condo at the Club Continental, complaining about chest pains. ""When paramedics and police arrived, they found him unresponsive on the bed,"" Cornett said. Powell was pronounced dead at the scene, and his cardiologist signed the death certificate at 1:52 a.m. ET Wednesday. According to the officer, Powell missed an appointment with the same doctor on Tuesday. Powell joined the original Skynyrd band in 1972, but he worked for the Jacksonville, Florida-based band for several years before that as a crew member. Among the Southern rock band's acclaimed songs are ""What's Your Name,"" ""Freebird"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" all released in the 1970s. ""Sweet Home Alabama"" reached the top 10 in 1974. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Two years after the plane crash, Powell, Allen Collins, Gary Rossington and Leon Wilkeson formed the Rossington-Collins Band. It broke up in 1982. A new Lynyrd Skynyrd band formed in 1987 and included Johnny Van Zant, Ronnie's brother. It began a tour in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where the plane was headed when it crashed. The band's last album, ""Vicious Cycle,"" came out in 2003.","Billy Powell called 911 Tuesday night complaining of chest pains, police say .

924,"(CNN) -- The explosions that killed one person and wounded two others in central Stockholm, Sweden, were ""an act of terrorism,"" a Swedish police official said Sunday. Two explosions occurred within minutes of each other Saturday in the district full of Christmas shoppers, Swedish authorities said. A Swedish news agency and police said they received e-mailed threats 10 minutes before the explosions, but Swedish authorities have not confirmed the three events are connected, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said Sunday. The Swedish Security Service said the incidents appeared to be the work of ""a single perpetrator."" Reinfeldt called the explosions ""completely unacceptable"" as he mounted an impassioned defense of Swedish society in the face of what seems to be its first suicide bombing. ""This is not the path we want to go down. It is very serious that this has already happened,"" he said. ""Sweden is an open society,"" Reinfeldt added. ""It is an open society which has demonstrated a will that people must be able to come from different backgrounds, believe in different gods or not believe in any god at all. Be able to live side by side, together, in our open society."" Posts on websites that frequently feature statements and propaganda videos from Islamic radical groups posted a name and photo of a man identified as the attacker on Sunday. But Swedish police did not confirm the name Sunday evening, saying they were still trying to notify relatives of the dead man. Regional police chief Carin Gotblad said the bomber had ""failed."" ""While this was a very serious event, no innocent people were seriously hurt. If that was the intention, then the perpetrator failed,"" she said, adding that the country would not increase its terror threat level. Anders Thornberg, head of the security measures division for Swedish security police, told reporters Sunday that based on the agency's criteria for terrorism and a chief prosecutor's assessment, ""it is our judgment that this was an act of terrorism."" He said authorities are investigating whether the two explosions were related to one another, ""but there may well be a connection."" On Sunday night, London's Metropolitan Police executed a search warrant in Bedfordshire, north of London, in connection with the Stockholm probe, a police spokesman said. The spokesman, who would not give his name, said the warrant was executed under Britain's Terrorism Act 2000 and that ""no arrests have been made ... and no hazardous substances have been found."" The writer of the e-mailed threats to the Swedish news agency and police mentions the presence of Swedish troops in Afghanistan and a Swedish cartoonist who depicted the prophet Mohammed, according to TT, a Swedish news wire that received the threats. The e-mails contained sound files featuring a person speaking in Swedish and Arabic, TT reported. About 500 Swedish troops are in Afghanistan, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force. The sender referred to Swedish silence regarding the Afghanistan troops and the controversial cartoon by Lars Vilks that depicted Mohammed as having the body of a dog. ""Now your children, daughters and sisters will die like our brothers and sisters and children are dying,"" the e-mail states, according to TT. ""Our actions will speak for themselves,"" the person said in an audio recording attached to the e-mail. ""As long as you don't end your war against Islam and the humiliation against the prophet and with your stupid support to Lars Vilks the pig."" Police said the explosions were in a popular pedestrian shopping area. ""One explosion happened at the intersection of Drottninggatan and Olof Palmes Gata,"" two busy streets in central Stockholm, said police spokeswoman Petra Sjolander. She said the car exploded multiple times. ""It is likely that this was some kind of gas tubes that have caused the car to explode multiple times,"" Sjolander said. Two people at the site of the car explosion were hospitalized with minor injuries, Sjolander said. Video on Sweden's TV4 showed flames spewing from the car, which was parked behind several other vehicles. A second explosion occurred about five minutes later, at the intersection of Drottninggatan and Bryggargatan streets, Sjolander said. ""We don't know at this point what caused the second explosion,"" Sjolander said, describing it as suspicious. An unidentified man was found dead at the scene of the second blast. A bag was found near the body, Sjolander said. ""We had bomb technicians on site, but I can't give you any details of what they did,"" she said. A bomb robot rolled up to the body and removed the bag for examination, according to the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter. Thornberg said Sunday that he could not confirm whether the man blew himself up. When asked about the possibility of suicide bombing in Stockholm becoming a new trend, Thornberg replied, ""Yes, absolutely -- if that is the case, then it is very serious."" Thornberg said authorities are working on both intelligence and a normal police investigation and will try to determine ""if there may be any more acts of terrorism like this one being planned. At this point, we don't think there are more acts coming, but we can't say for sure."" ""What has happened does not signify a change of the current terrorism threat level in Sweden, but we will continuously be reassessing this to see if what has happened warrants a change in threat level,"" he said. In a message posted on Twitter Saturday, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said, ""Most worrying attempt at terrorist attack in crowded part of central Stockholm. Failed -- but could have been truly catastrophic."" Swedish terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp told CNN that he did not believe the attacker acted alone. ""This was not something where he just woke up and thought that he would blow himself up,"" said Ranstorp, a professor at the Swedish military academy and a former professor in terrorism studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. The e-mail writer ended the message with a call for action ""to all Mujahadeen in Europe and Sweden,"" TT said. ""Now is the time to strike, don't wait any longer,"" the message read, according to TT. ""Step up with whatever you have, even if it is a knife, and I know you have more than a knife. Fear no one, fear not prison, fear not death."" TT said that it was not clear from the e-mail or the audio files if the person belongs to any specific organization. The person claimed to have been to the Middle East and asked family for forgiveness for lying to them. ""I didn't go to the middle east to work,"" the writer said. ""I went there for jihad.""

925,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A powerful bomb planted in a car killed nine people and injured 21 others in northwest Pakistan on Wednesday, a senior police official said. The bomb rocked a neighborhood in the outskirts of Peshawar and destroyed several shops, said Peshawar police chief Liaqat Ali Khan.

And another car bomb targeted a police patrol in south Kirkuk, Taher said. These coordinated attacks resembled past attacks by al Qaeda in Iraq, Kirkuk police said . In other attacks, eight civilians were wounded Wednesday morning when two roadside bombs exploded in two Baghdad neighborhoods, police said. On Tuesday, an Iraqi army officer, Brigadier General Ahsan Ali Mohammed, was killed when a bomb exploded outside his house in western Baghdad's Ghazaliya neighborhood, police said.","The attacks occurred in Iraq's oil-rich northern city of Kirkuk, police said .

927,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A suicide bomber wearing an explosives-packed vest attacked a police recruitment center in northern Iraq Tuesday, a bloody strike that killed at least 65 people and wounded 160 others. The attacker -- who blew himself up when he was among hundreds of recruits -- staged the assault at a checkpoint where people usually wait their turn to enter the center. The explosion caused a fire at a fuel station nearby, police in Tikrit said, and most of those killed and wounded were young men who came to join police forces. Tikrit's general hospital was overwhelmed with wounded people, some of whom had to be sent to hospitals in nearby towns of the Salaheddin province and to other locations, such as Irbil and Kirkuk. Salaheddin Deputy Governor Ameen Mohammed told Iraqiya state TV that security forces in the province are on full alert, and police said the local government announced a three-day mourning period in Salaheddin. Iraqi Prime Nuri al-Maliki wants to get to the bottom of the incident, which he calls the latest of similar ""heinous crimes."" He said it reflects ""clear negligence and a shortcoming by the concerned authorities, so we will follow up this matter with all seriousness in order to determine those who are negligent, particularly those who are responsible of the recruitment cases and those who are behind today's painful tragedy."" Vice President Tariq Al-Hashimi deplored what he called a ""cowardly"" act. ""This new tragedy added to the tragedies of the unemployment of Iraqi youth,"" al-Hashimi said. The vice president called on authorities to tackle unemployment and to keep young people from sinking into hunger and crime. He also said authorities need to reconsider how to protect recruits at such centers, which he called soft targets. Mosques urged Tikrit residents to donate blood for the wounded. The center is located nearly 100 miles north of Baghdad in Tikrit, the hometown of late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, and the facility is in one of Hussein's former palaces. There has been no claim of responsibility but al Qaeda in Iraq, the Sunni Muslim-dominated militant group, has frequently claimed responsibility for such attacks. Tikrit is largely a Sunni Muslim city. Iraqi recruitment centers have frequently been targeted in warfare over the years. On August 17, 48 were killed when suicide bombers attacked a military recruitment center in the Bab al-Moudham commercial area of central Baghdad. The same center was attacked again in September, and 12 people were killed. The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group for al Qaeda in Iraq and other Sunni extremist groups, claimed responsibility for that bombing, authorities said. U.S. troops have ended their combat mission in Iraq and have focused on training and advising. But they feel the violence that occasionally erupts. On Saturday, three U.S. soldiers were killed, two in northern Iraq and another in the central part of the country. Under a U.S.-Iraqi security agreement, all U.S. troops are to leave Iraq by the end of the year. There are fewer than 50,000 American service members there now.

928,"(CNN) -- Eleven people were killed and 29 injured during a stampede at an election rally for Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, officials said. The stampede happened during a rally at Port Harcourt stadium in the country's southern delta, Rivers state spokesman Rita Inoma-Abbey told CNN. The area is the president's home turf and a main area of support. A presidential spokesman said that Jonathan has called for a full-scale investigation into the cause of the stampede. The president ""has received with shock and sadness, news of the unfortunate loss of lives"" at the stadium, Ima Niboro said. ""I am sad, and heavily weighed down by this incident. It is sad, unfortunate and regrettable. I mourn with those who mourn tonight. May God grant us all the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss,"" Jonathan said. The stampede follows what has been an imperfect start to Jonathan's campaign. At his first campaign stop in Nassarawa state, youths defaced his posters, burned tires, and two people were killed in the confusion. At another stop in Kano, supporters walked out before his speech, and in Ogun state he was criticized for calling opposition candidates ""rascals.""","A stampede at an event for President Goodluck Jonathan killed 11 .

929,"Miami (CNN) -- A Florida father found in a contaminated pest control truck with his seriously injured son and a bagged body has been charged with aggravated child abuse, authorities said Tuesday night. George Barahona, 53, will likely face other charges from the ""complicated"" investigation, said Chase Scott, a spokesman for the West Palm Beach Police Department. The incident began Monday morning when a pest control truck pulled to the side of Interstate 95 in the West Palm Beach area. Firefighters called to the scene found the man and boy suffering from some type of illness, Scott said. Barahona and his son, Victor, 10, were rushed to hospitals in serious condition, Scott said. The father is in intensive care in another hospital, but is lucid and has talked with investigators, police said. The charge is related to his 10-year-old son. The boy suffered burns and injuries from inhaling unknown contaminants, Scott said. ""He is in a difficult medical condition"" and is in isolation. ""He did suffer some burns from the chemicals that were on his clothing and his body,"" Scott said. Investigators found in the rear of a truck a somewhat deteriorated bagged body. Workers had to don emergency hazardous materials outfits and wrapped the body twice more to limit exposure. The workers were later decontaminated. Police don't know how long father and son were exposed to the toxins, Scott said. ""They were incredibly toxic chemicals."" The body was taken to the county medical examiner's office for positive identification, said Scott, adding investigators have an idea of who it might be. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining the truck and chemicals, Scott said. The entire vehicle, which was emitting fumes, is covered in unidentified chemicals, according to Scott. The FBI has been asked to assist; it is taking samples to identify the makeup of what Scott described as a highly toxic liquid. Neighbors of Barahona told reporters that he is an exterminator. Within the past few days a child protection investigation had been opened to look into a complaint involving the Barahona family, said Florida Department of Children and Families spokesman Mark Riordan. The agency is responsible for investigating allegations of abuse, abandonment and neglect of a minor. He would not elaborate on the nature of the complaint in this case, but said the agency has investigated complaints about the family in the past, ""Several times we've been out to the home,"" he said. The Barahonas had adopted four children, including Victor, from Florida's foster care system, Riordan said. Police have spoken with Victor's mother, Scott said. ""We're in the preliminary stages of an extremely tragic, complex set of circumstances,"" Riordan said. ""We're working side by side with law enforcement from two jurisdictions to make sure from DCF's perspective that the children are safe."" To ensure their safety, the ""remaining"" children have been removed from the family home and have been placed with a close relative, Riordan told CNN. He would not specify how many children were removed. Law enforcement officials in West Palm Beach are handling the death investigation, while authorities in the Miami area, where the Barahona home is located, are looking into the family and the safety of the children, Riordan said. Scott said some firefighters became sick from fumes coming from the vehicle, but they have all been treated and released. A guard and others at the hospital where the boy was taken also complained of feeling ill. CNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report .","NEW: Father charged with aggravated child abuse .

930,"Atlanta (CNN) -- Investigators in Georgia were looking Friday for a man who left the scene of a suburban Atlanta house fire that killed three children, authorities said. They said the fire was caused by a suspected methamphetamine lab in the Lilburn, Georgia, home. Gwinnett County Police Capt. Jake Smith said Ivan Gonzalez had been charged with two counts of murder Friday, a day after firefighters found him attempting to douse the blaze with a garden hose. Gonzalez, who Smith said received burns in the fire, told authorities he was a family member and was headed to the hospital to be near the children injured in the fire. Gonzalez, who is not related to the children, never reached the hospital, authorities said. Authorities checked other area hospitals and did not find Gonzalez. Gonzalez is described as 5 feet, 7 inches tall and 190 pounds, with a tattoo of the Virgin Mary on his leg. The victims, whose names were not released, are an 18-month-old girl and two boys, ages 3 and 4. Passersby pulled the children from the burning building. The children were taken to Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta. One died Thursday and the others two died Friday morning. ""The children had significant burn injuries and significant smoke inhalation injuries,"" said Gwinnett County Fire Department Capt. Tommy Rutledge. Rutledge said the fire started in a hallway between the kitchen and a stairwell in the center of the house. Smith said a third murder count is pending against Gonzalez. Neibi Brito, the victims' mother, is charged with drug trafficking, Smith said. ""The lack of responsibility, of course, is disturbing,"" Smith said. ""We have a tragic case involving three young children, but we're going to treat it professionally and not let the emotions of it get in the way of the investigation in any way.""

932,"(CNN) -- Philippine seismologists issued an alert on Mount Bulusan Sunday after the Luzon Island volcano erupted twice during a 24-hour period, according to a bulletin released by the nation's volcano-monitoring agency. However, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHILVOCS) said the eruptions posed little threat to the villages surrounding the Luzon Island volcano. Most of the villages lie outside the 4-kilometer (2 1/2-mile) danger zone, the bulletin stated. Philippine volcanologists, according to the agency, aren't expecting Mount Bulusan to erupt again soon. The volcano is located about 249 kilometers (155 miles) southeast of Manila. The area immediately surrounding the Bulusan Volcano is mostly rural. There are several villages, but most are outside the danger zone, according to PHILVOCS. The most recent eruption, which took place before dawn local time on Sunday lasted about 20 minutes, according to the agency. In declaring an ""Alert Level 1,"" the agency warned nearby residents not to enter the 4-kilometer ""permanent danger zone"" because of possible steam and ash explosions. Area residents were also warned of the possibility of flooding if heavy rains push sediment-filled streams out of their banks.","Philippine seismologists declare Alert Level 1 for Mount Bulusan volcano .

933,"(CNN) -- A Florida exterminator and father of four children adopted from Florida's foster care system has told police that a body found in the pest-control truck he was driving is one of them -- his 10-year-old daughter, authorities said Wednesday. Jorge Barahona, 53, already faces a charge of aggravated child abuse for injuries to the dead girl's twin, Victor, who was also found in the truck, which was parked on the side of I-95 near West Palm Beach, Florida, officials said. According to a probable-cause affidavit filed by the West Palm Beach Police Department, a roadside assistance ranger with the Florida Department of Transportation stopped to check the red Toyota pickup Monday around 5:30 a.m. and found the 10-year-old boy inside next to an open gas can. The boy ""appeared to be in respiratory distress and (was) trembling"" and his clothing ""was soaked with an unknown chemical,"" the affidavit said. The ranger then found Barahona on the ground beside the truck and called for help. The boy was hospitalized in intensive care with severe burns to his abdomen, upper thighs and buttocks, the affidavit said.  While examining the boy, doctors noted he had sustained previous injuries, including a broken collarbone, a broken arm, scarring to his buttocks and lower abdomen, and ligature marks on both wrists, police said. After Barahona and his son were taken to a hospital, a worker decontaminating the truck discovered the body of the girl, wrapped in a plastic bag, the document said. Barahona told police he was distraught over the death of his daughter, and had intended to commit suicide by dousing himself with gasoline and setting himself afire, the affidavit said.  Barahona said he didn't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him, the document added. ""Basically, to paraphrase, he was stating that he placed his daughter in a plastic bag being distraught over her death,"" West Palm Beach Police Spokesman Chase Scott told reporters. ""He drove here from South Florida accompanied by his son, Victor. He then pulled off to the side of the road saying that he poured gas on his self, intending to light himself on fire. His son's head was in his lap and he decided, after giving his son some sleeping pills, that he wasn't going to do that."" Barahona told police that he doused himself with gasoline and inadvertently got some on the boy, Police Capt. Mary Olsen said. But, she added, the man's story doesn't add up -- there was no gasoline on the boy. Instead, he was covered with another chemical whose composition had yet to be determined. ""That's why we're still treating this as a hazmat (hazardous materials case),"" she said. Scott said the chemicals were so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well, he said. Victor, who was transferred Wednesday morning to a specialized burn unit at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, has not been able to talk to investigators because he is on a breathing tube, she said. Olsen said police would decide how to charge Barahona further once the autopsy on his daughter determines her cause of death. Asked whether Barahona has expressed remorse, she said, ""He feels remorse, but we're not getting consistent statements with what we're seeing in our evidence."" She added, ""It's a complex case."" At a hearing Wednesday in Miami attended by Barahona's wife, Carmen, a judge ordered that the remaining two children in the home be placed in foster care. Florida's Department of Children and Families had opened a child protection investigation within the past few days to look into a complaint involving the Barahona family, and it wasn't the first such complaint, spokesman Mark Riordan said. Reporters in the courtroom Wednesday heard tales of abuse, mainly concerning the twins, from state officials and experts.  The caller to the child protection hotline in the latest case reported that the twins were routinely locked in a bathroom for long periods of time and had been bound with tape, the court heard. The story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home, officials said in court. An investigator told the court that she had showed up last Friday night at the family's home but had not seen the children. Instead, she said, she had left the family's house after speaking with Carmen Barahona, planning to return on Monday. Asked why she had not planned to return sooner, she said, ""I'm not allowed to do investigations on a weekend."" However, a spokesman for the department, John Harrell, said it is the job of investigators to follow through immediately or refer to someone else in the department to follow through when a matter is urgent.

934,"Parker, Colorado (CNN) -- When the sniper's bullet hit his neck, Staff Sgt. Matthew Keil nearly blacked out. ""I had heard the gunshot, and it felt like someone had kicked me right in the back. A ton of bricks swung and hit me in the back, and I fell,"" he said. ""I couldn't feel my body. I could only feel my head, and it felt like I was floating."" He was on a rooftop in Ramadi, Iraq, leading a nine-man squad. His men rushed to his aid, stopped the bleeding and then strapped him to a stretcher to evacuate him. This is when Keil finally closed his eyes. A short time later, a world away, in Colorado, Tracy Keil's phone rang: Her husband had been severely wounded. Tracy Keil was a successful accountant working in corporate America. She didn't know it at the time, but that day, February 24, 2007, was the last day she would ever work a regular job. A much more difficult job and an uncertain future awaited her. Sgt. Keil opened his eyes again three days later at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Tracy was by his side. ""My wife was standing next to the bed, and she said, 'I'm here, I'm not going anywhere. I'll be here as long as you need. You're stuck with me,' "" he recalls. Matthew's legs and right arm were paralyzed, and he had minimal control over his left arm. He would use a wheelchair for the rest of his life. This is the point where some spouses call it quits. ""I could have. I watched a lot of wives leave. When we said our vows, I meant every word of it. It didn't matter what physical or mental condition he was in. It just didn't. He was alive, and that's all that mattered,"" Tracy says. Down, but not out, they set about building a new life: Months of physical therapy and rehab, then back to Colorado. It was a lot for any couple to handle, but Tracy, 33, and Matt, 29, were still newlyweds. They had exchanged vows just six weeks to the day before Matt was shot. While most young couples are focused on building careers and starting a family, the Keils were focused on learning to live in their new roles: him as paraplegic, her as caregiver. They were determined to not let the injury define them. They would have a full and productive life, but it would take determination and hard work. ""I think Matt and I were more prepared as a couple for death than for an injury like this,"" Tracy says. ""We had talked about a lot of things, but we have never talked about this."" So they turned to the Department of Veterans Affairs for help. The Keils say the VA has taken good care of Matthew's primary medical concerns, but there was no help for Tracy. She longed for support and to be recognized for her role as Matthew's caregiver. In the Army, Matthew loved the feeling of being part of a team. But the Keils felt abandoned. Then, in May 2010, a new federal law passed that promised to help caretakers like Tracy. Under the law, caregivers would receive a financial stipend, health care, training and -- perhaps most importantly -- respite care.  Trained health care providers would come into the home and give the caretaker a break. Obama signs $3.6 billion veterans caregiver bill . The law was supposed to take effect on January 31, but so far, none of the new benefits have been implemented. The VA says it is unable to provide a timeline for when the benefits will be available, but in a statement, the agency says it's working as quickly as possible. ""VA understands that every day is a challenge for the Caregivers of our most critically injured or ill Veterans. That's why VA is working to move forward with deliberate haste to implement this complex Act. Different benefits will have different implementation timelines based upon the law's requirements and the complexity of the benefit."" During the signing ceremony in May, President Obama hailed the legislation as ""a major step forward in America's commitment to families and caregivers who tend to our wounded warriors every day."" When asked about the delay in implementation, a White House official said ""the President views delays in payments to caregivers as unacceptable. He has directed his team to work through options immediately to get these benefits to the caregivers who need them."" The VA says that the new program is complicated to implement and that it has never before given benefits to nonveterans, so systems must be out into place to determine eligibility and prevent fraud and abuse. The delay has left the Keils felling abandoned once again. Tracy has been forced to give up her career and faces decades of caring for Matt. As much as the benefits, Tracy is looking for recognition for the work she does to help her wounded warrior husband. ""I had a great job, I made good money, we had plans to buy a house and move forward. I had a lot of potential."" She says. ""Now it's like I'm working for the VA for free."" Matt is unable to even get himself out of bed and needs constant care with everything from feeding to using the toilet. For Tracy, it's a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week job. ""There are days that I think, 'How am I going to do this for the rest of my life?' "" She says, ""I love him, and I would do anything for him, and that's what gets you though those really, really hard days."" Through their hard work, the Keils have built a new life. A nonprofit group, Homes for Our Troops, built a wheelchair-accessible house for the Keils, and through artificial insemination, the couple's hope of starting a family has come true: Twins Faith and Matthew Jr. were born in November. The babies add even more work for Tracy. Given Matt's injury, some people have told them they have no business having kids. ""I feel like we should be afforded all the same hopes and dreams that everybody else has,"" she says. ""I don't think because he is injured, we should have any less dreams than anyone else."" After four years of dealing with the VA, Tracy Keil says she has developed a reputation as a fighter. It's a part of her role as caretaker that she takes very seriously, but she looks forward to a day when she won't have to waste her valuable energy fighting for their benefits. ""Despite what the VA must think, I don't enjoy fighting with them for every little thing. It would be nice to just be able to just ask for something and them say 'Sure, it's in the regulations, here you go.' That would be wonderful."" She says. ""But the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and I squeak a lot.""","A sniper's bullet in Iraq left Staff Sgt. Matthew Keil paralyzed .

935,"Chimaltenango, Guatemala (CNN) -- In rural Guatemala, all it takes is a few minutes for tons of heavy mud to plow into a vulnerable hillside community and swallow its people and their homes. Sometimes, the devastation is there for all to see. But not always. ""I met a couple who lost their children and their home ... all of it just gone,"" Anne Hallum said, recalling a trip to the country in 2005. ""We arrived, and it was hard to believe anyone had died. There weren't bodies lying around. ... They were buried under."" Hundreds of dangerous mudslides occur every year during Guatemala's rainy season, which lasts from mid-May until October or November. In one extreme case, a mudslide resulted in 700 deaths, according to CEPAL, the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America. There are plenty of natural reasons why Guatemalans are vulnerable to mudslides: frequent earthquakes, hurricanes and heavy rains oversaturate Guatemala's mountainous terrain and muddy the soil. But Hallum said there's another mudslide trigger to consider. ""Deforestation -- or the absence of trees -- causes mudslides to occur,"" said Hallum, co-founder of the Alliance for International Reforestation, a nonprofit trying to help the villagers protect themselves from mudslides. ""Trees are cut for firewood and to make room for the crops, and without realizing it ... they've taken away their protection. Where it used to be rainforest becomes an open space for the mud to come right on through."" Nearly 373 square kilometers of trees are destroyed each year in Guatemala, according to the University of Santa Barbara's Department of Geography. Through her group's efforts, Hallum is inspiring villagers to stop chopping and, instead, use trees to safeguard their lives and crops against mudslides. The effort, nearly 20 years strong, was one Hallum said she never really planned. A political science professor at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, Hallum traveled to the rural town of Nueva Concepcion, Guatemala, in 1991 as an adviser for a university field trip. It was her first trip outside the United States, and despite not being able to speak Spanish, she was moved by a blatant poverty that ""broke her heart"" and birthed a ""new purpose."" ""I went into the villages where lots of the trees were cut down, and I held some of the children,"" said Hallum, 57. ""They were listless and couldn't hold themselves up. Their eyes were dull, and it became pretty clear that they were malnourished."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . The farms she visited were not sustainable, she said, because the soil was eroded and lacked nutrients. Hallum, a self-proclaimed nature lover, was not formally trained in agriculture, but she knew some basic facts about trees and food products that could be cheaply grown. With the help of a former student, she researched rural resources and learned that many local Guatemalan tree varieties could be strategically replanted to provide fruit, fertilizer, coffee, food and medicinal herbs where resources were failing or nonexistent. ""When we started, it was all about fighting poverty,"" Hallum said. ""We wanted to help families farm better and feed their children better. But we started to notice that in the areas where (pine) trees were planted, the mudslides were no longer occurring. So that brought a new focus for us. Food, shade, fertilizer and mudslide protection -- the trees can do it all."" Not all trees that are planted can protect against mudslides, but Hallum said pine trees planted on high mountain slopes can be most effective. Pine trees have long, anchoring tap roots that can extend 6 meters below the soil. When they are planted in slopes above residential areas, Hallum explained, heavy rains are unlikely to loosen their grip on the soil. ""We learned the hard way that without trees, we are at risk, and our land is at risk,"" said Jose Avelino Boc, a lemon farmer and Alliance program participant. Boc, 53, has lost family and friends to mudslide disasters, and he now attributes his life and the success of his farm to Hallum's nonprofit. ""The trees give us life,"" he said. ""If there is too much rain, they keep the soil. And the mountainside doesn't fall down anymore."" Constant land surveys, particularly during the rainy season, help Hallum and her team identify which rural areas need assistance. But the easiest way to determine which village to target next, Hallum said, is simply ""to answer the door."" ""They're coming to us directly now to ask for help,"" Hallum said. ""People know us, and now they trust us."" Local Guatemalan staff -- all trained agroforestry technicians -- are assigned six villages each and provide free weekly instructional courses on topics like tree planting, sustainable farming and air quality. Each technician remains in his or her assigned communities for five years. Hallum credits her group's success to this commitment of staying within a community until the community itself can see and reap benefits. ""It's a lot of work,"" Hallum said. ""We don't come in, plant some trees and leave. We do that, and they'll cut them down. It's a step-by-step process that starts with education. In a little time, they notice their crops are doing better; mudslides aren't happening. And the behavior changes: They start to protect the trees. We say: 'All right, you've got it. You know how to do this now.' Then we leave ... on to the next village."" The Alliance for International Reforestation has helped 110 rural villages plant more than 3.8 million trees throughout Guatemala. As an added incentive for attending classes and planting trees, the group donates and installs ecofriendly, fuel-efficient cooking stoves to some program participants based on economic need. These stoves require very little firewood and give off no emissions. With the stoves, not only are fewer trees cut down, but families no longer inhale dangerous fumes caused by stovetop, chimney-less cooking. The group also provides educational resources and promotes economic independence within communities. Its agroforestry textbook series has been adopted by more than 200 Guatemalan schools. Hundreds of women have also benefited from the rural farming initiative. They help generate income for their families from the sale of fruits, salves and shampoos created from trees and fruits they learned to harvest. ""I learned so much from AIR and from Anne,"" Doña Elena Siquinajay said. ""We're 50 women in our village working together. ... We come together and plant in the tree nurseries or pack the products, and we support each other. It is a lot of work, but we enjoy it very much. Without the program, some of us would not learn anything."" Although Hallum remains a full-time university professor, she spends all of her free time in Guatemala. After 40 visits, she is happy with the progress of the program and vows to keep returning to the ""place where her heart remains."" ""I can go back to areas that were nothing but mudslides and soil erosion, and now I see forest,"" Hallum said. ""This is not just a project. We are a team. It's about building the community and saving the planet. ... It's about a better future for the children."" Want to get involved?

936,"New York (CNN) -- A veteran police officer died from his injuries Friday after a shooting in Poughkeepsie, New York, according to the Poughkeepsie Police Department. The name of the deceased officer, an 18-year veteran of the department, was not released pending notification of relatives. Another police officer was being treated for a minor injury at Vasser Medical Center, Poughkeepsie Police Chief Ronald Knapp said at a press conference Friday afternoon. ""Today is the worst day our city has seen in perhaps our history,"" Mayor Mike Tkazyik said. Two other people died in the incident. The suspected gunman died from gunshot wounds at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, according to hospital spokesman Greg Zurawick. Another victim, an unidentified female, was also shot, according to Knapp. She is believed to be the wife of the suspected gunman. The deceased officer suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, according to Knapp. A confrontation began around 1 p.m. Friday after Poughkeepsie authorities received reports of a shooting in a small parking lot. An officer noticed a man fleeing the scene of the shooting with a child in his arms and tried to confront the man. The child was removed from the man, but another confrontation involving multiple officers ensued, Knapp said. That was when the fatal shootings took place. The child is now in custody of New York state juvenile authorities.","Mayor: ""Today is the worst day our city has seen perhaps in our history""

937,"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- One person was killed and more that two dozen were hurt in a fresh round of anti-government protests in Yemen on Thursday, eyewitnesses and an opposition lawmaker reported. An 18-year-old demonstrator died in Aden when police fired to disperse protesters, said Aref al-Qubati, a participant who said the victim was a friend of his. It was the second fatality reported in the past two days in Aden, where authorities cut off power to the Al-Mansoora district and fired into the air to break up the crowd of about 3,000. At least 12 other people were wounded in clashes with security forces throughout the day, witnesses said. But journalists have been barred from the city's Al-Naqeeb hospital, and about 400 guards surrounded the facility. And in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, at least 20 people were injured in clashes between stone-throwing pro- and anti-government demonstrators, opposition lawmaker Ahmed Hashid told CNN. Police at the scene did not try to intervene, he said. The clash took place in western Sanaa, with about 600 government opponents there at the peak, anti-government demonstrators claimed. The opponents had planned to gather at Sanaa University, but said they found government supporters there who forced them to leave, they said. By the time CNN arrived, there were about 100 anti-government protesters and 300 to 400 supporters of the government near the intersection of Rabat Street and Fitteen Street. One injured person was carried away while CNN was present, but it was not clear how serious the injuries were. Gunfire was heard in the area as well, but it was difficult to determine who was shooting or what the target was. Yemen is among several Middle Eastern nations to find itself convulsed by daily protests after the revolts that toppled the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt in recent weeks. Anti-government protesters have called for the ouster of longtime Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has ruled the country since 1978. The country has been wracked by a Shiite . Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives, a secessionist movement in its once-independent south and a looming shortage of water. In an attempt to quell growing discontent, Saleh has announced that he won't seek another term in 2013 and would postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for April to allow more time for reform talks with the opposition. It is not clear who the pro-government demonstrators are. Anti-government activists say the government is putting hired thugs and plainclothes police on the street to break up protests, but pro-government demonstrators have told CNN they are there of their own volition and are not being paid. The government has not responded to CNN questions about the pro-government demonstrators. The top European Union foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, is ""very concerned"" about the events in Aden, her representative said in a statement Thursday. Ashton ""strongly deplores the loss of life and violence and calls for calm and restraint of all parties,"" the statement said, calling for ""genuine, comprehensive and inclusive national dialogue."" Human rights activists accused pro-government demonstrators of beating students after a similar protest in Sanaa Wednesday. Witnesses in Aden said the victim was an 18-year-old who was shot by security forces as they tried to disperse the crowd. Video distributed by student activists appeared to show the youth being carried away, bleeding heavily from his left side. But CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video, and there was no immediate confirmation of the fatality from hospital officials. The Aden protest drew thousands of demonstrators, mostly students, to the city's Al Mansoora district for a sixth straight day. And in Sanaa, students at Sanaa University rallied inside the gates of the campus in a demonstration organized by the head of the university's student union, said Omar Al-Nihmi, a third-year media student at the school. The three students injured in Sanaa were attacked while on their way home from the university demonstration, human rights activist Abdul Rahman Barman said. Barman said he took one of the students to the hospital with head injuries from being hit with sticks, but the other two had only minor injuries. The student protest began as a call for an improved curriculum, for removal of the university dean and for security forces to remain off-campus. But about 90 minutes into the event, the mood turned anti-government, said third-year student Salah Al-Janadi. More students showed up, both Al-Nihmi and Al-Janadi said, and the protesters began chanting anti-government slogans such as ""The people want the fall of the regime"" and ""Oh Ali, son of Saleh, your regime is no good."" They also chanted, ""Our protests are peaceful and we don't have weapons."" Shortly afterward, hundreds of pro-government demonstrators turned up -- but they were outside the university gates, while the students were inside. The pro-government demonstrators began throwing rocks, Al-Janadi said. Al-Janadi said he was told by the protest organizers ""that because today's protest was a student union protest at the university, security forces at the scene would not interfere."" Hundreds of police were on the scene as well. They did not interfere with protesters, Al-Janadi said, but fired bullets into the air, successfully dispersing the crowds.

939,"(CNN) -- A space rocket carrying communications equipment exploded soon after takeoff Saturday evening in India, a news agency reported. The unmanned rocket strayed from its flight path and broke into pieces, according to the Press Trust of India. Video of the incident showed huge plumes of white and copper-colored smoke streaming across the sky. CNN's sister network, CNN-IBN, reported that the rocket lifted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota. Its launch was originally scheduled for December 20, but had been postponed because of an engine leak, CNN-IBN said. It was not immediately clear what caused the failure, which the Press Trust called a setback to India's space program.","An unmanned rocket carrying communications equipment exploded, media reports .

940,"New York (CNN) -- The fall that seriously injured an actor in the stage musical ""Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark"" was caused by human error, an actors' union said Wednesday. The ""Spider-Man"" company met Tuesday with officials from the union, the Actors Equity Association, and members of Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York State Department of Labor. The union said after consulting with OSHA and the labor agency, it concluded that the fall was caused by human error. The union did not give any details but said it worked with the other agencies to develop a safety plan to address the issue. Christopher Tierney, 31, is listed in serious condition, said Bellevue Hospital spokesman Steven Bohlen. Jonathan Dealwis, a tourist from New Zealand who was in the audience, said Tierney fell ""about 6 meters,"" or about 20 feet, Monday night. Reeve Carney is the actor who plays Spider-Man, but nine people perform Spider-Man's stunts when the character is masked, according to show spokesman Jaron Caldwell. Dealwis said the accident happened near the end of the show. ""Spider-Man was on a bridge, and Mary Jane was dangling from it,"" Dealwis said. ""I think he was meant to sort of swoop over there, but he just fell off. ... The harness, you could see it just flick off his back and fly backward."" Afterward, Dealwis said, ""It just went black, and the producer came on and said we're going to pause for a moment. You could hear Mary Jane weeping."" A producer then came out and said the show was over, Dealwis said. Dealwis said the performer was wheeled away in a neck brace and was alert when he was taken to Bellevue Hospital. Rick Miramontez, another show spokesman, issued a statement confirming the performer fell from a platform and the show was stopped. ""All signs were good as he was taken to the hospital for observation,"" Miramontez said. Wednesday's matinee performance was postponed after the incident, Miramontez said, but all subsequent performances will proceed as scheduled. Show director Julie Taymor said the accident was ""obviously heartbreaking for our entire team and, of course, to me personally."" ""I am so thankful that Chris is going to be all right and is in great spirits,"" Taymor said in a statement Tuesday. ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our 'Spider-Man' family, and we'll continue to do everything in our power to protect the cast and crew."" The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and The Edge, is the most expensive in Broadway history, but the production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems. CNN's John Roberts, Ethel Bass and Logan Burruss contributed to this report.","Director Julie Taymor calls fall ""heartbreaking""

941,"(CNN) -- Last year was the safest in aviation history for passengers flying on Western-built jets, an international aviation trade group said Wednesday. The 2010 global accident rate was 0.61 per million flights, a rate equating to one accident for every 1.6 million flights, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). That is just below the previous historic low rate of 0.65 rate in 2006, and a ""significant improvement"" over the rate of 0.71 recorded in 2009. There were 17 plane accidents -- or hull losses, in the lingo of the business -- involving Western-built jet aircraft in 2010, compared to 19 the previous year. A hull loss is an accident in which a plane is destroyed or damaged beyond repair. There were 786 fatalities in passenger aircraft compared to 685 in 2009, IATA said. As in the past, there were significant regional differences in the accident rates, with North America having relatively low rates and Africa having the worst rate. While Africa's hull loss rate was 7.41 -- four Western-built planes crashed in Africa -- it was lower than the 2009 rate of 9.94. IATA Director General Giovanni Bisignani said African systems must improve. ""Flying must be equally safe in all parts of the world,"" Bisignani said. ""An accident rate in Africa that is over 12 times the global average is not acceptable."" He said African carriers should make use of an IATA audit system to improve safety. Runway excursions -- instances when a plane leaves the runway during take-offs or landings -- accounted for 21 percent of the worldwide accidents, IATA said, saying the number has dropped because of attention to the problem. Some of the accidents occur when planes land on wet runways; others when the aircraft approaches too fast, too high or touches down beyond the desired spot on the runway. IATA said it is working with the industry and regulators to address the issue. IATA said 2010 had the following results: . 2.4 billion people flew safely on 36.8 million flights. 94 accidents for all types of aircraft -- Eastern and Western built -- compared to 90 in 2009. 23 fatal accidents for all passenger aircraft types, compared to 18 in 2009.

942,"(CNN) -- A commercial flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Minneapolis was aborted shortly after takeoff Sunday morning because of an indicator warning that one of the aircraft's engines had been damaged, according to airline officials. Delta Air Lines Flight 1846 returned to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport within minutes of its 7:45 a.m. takeoff without incident or injury to any of its 119 passengers or six crew members, according to an airline spokesman. All were rescheduled to take another flight to Minnesota later Sunday afternoon, said Delta spokesman Anthony Black. Black said Delta mechanics confirmed that parts of the twin-engine Boeing 737-800 had been damaged, though the spokesman did not know which ones. ""Incidents like this are extremely rare, but the crew knows the protocol and it's clear the pilot took appropriate action,"" Black said. Broward County Aviation Department spokesman Greg Meyer told CNN affiliate WPLG-TV that pieces of what appeared to be parts of the jet's damaged engine were recovered near the airport. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said an initial inspection of the aircraft revealed a ""contained failure."" ""Engine turbine blades exited the rear of the engine, they did not penetrate the engine cover,"" wrote Bergen in an e-mail to CNN. Bergen said the FAA is continuing to investigate the incident.

943,"(CNN) -- The nation's most energy-efficient National Christmas Tree doesn't appear to be the nation's most energy-resistant one. The 42-foot Colorado blue spruce snapped at its base during high winds Saturday morning in Washington. Sustained winds at 25 miles per hour and wind gusts up to 50 miles per hour swept through the area and snapped the tree 4 feet above the ground, the National Park Service said in a statement. By 5:30 p.m., less than seven hours later, the tree was reduced to mulch by work crews. The tree was trimmed over the holidays with green-hued LED lights and snowflake ornaments in an area called The Ellipse directly between the south lawn of the White House and the Washington Monument. The first family lighted the tree, a tradition going back 87 years, on December 9, 2010, as blues legend B.B. King, Maroon 5, and others performed at the ceremony. It stayed lit each evening until New Year's Day. According to the National Park Service, decorations are provided by sponsoring organizations from every state and are placed in a protective plastic globe to protect them from bad weather. The Park Service has identified a successor tree and will announce this spring when it will be brought to the Ellipse, the statement said. The spruce had been in its current location for more than 32 years. It came from the Myers family farm outside York, Pennsylvania, the Park Service said. ""The tree had been planted and watered by the Myers' grandchildren. When the tree was 6 years old it had been planted in the Myers' front yard as a Mother's Day gift for Mrs. Myers. After discussions with the NPS horticulturists, the Myers agreed to let the tree go to become the nation's Christmas tree.""","High winds snapped the tree Saturday morning .

944,"(CNN) -- Scientists in New Zealand said there had been less than a one in twenty chance of Tuesday's earthquake being so destructive. The fatal 6.3 magnitude quake that has damaged much of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island was actually an aftershock of the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that struck the same area in September last year. Seismologists for GNS Science had calculated on Monday that there was only a 35% chance of a 5.0 magnitude aftershock hitting the region in the near future, but only a 4% chance of a 6.0 or above aftershock. Check out CNN's hi-res image gallery of the earthquake . ""It's part of a sequence, so not uncommon, but this was so large it will have aftershocks of its own,"" said Dr. Bill Fry of GNS Science. Tuesday's quake caused widespread damage as the epicenter was only around 3 miles (5 kilometers) below the earth's surface. ""Anything less than 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) deep is really shallow,"" said Fry. Fry and his colleagues had been monitoring the region since the September 4 earthquake. That quake struck before dawn and authorities said the deserted streets at that time likely kept injuries to a minimum. Most earthquakes happen away from the Christchurch region, said Fry, but in a country that experiences around 15,000 earthquakes each year, it wasn't completely unexpected, he said. The majority of those quakes are hardly felt and do not damage property. On average New Zealand only experiences a few magnitude 6 earthquakes each year. Prior to Tuesday's quake the most damaging to hit the country was in 1931 near Hawke's Bay on the North Island. The country is on the south western edge of the Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes and earthquakes that ring the Pacific ocean, and straddles the Pacific and Indian-Australian tectonic plates. Movement of the plates causes earthquakes across the country and volcanic activity in the North Island. Christchurch is New Zealand's second biggest city on the eastern side of the South Island. The population of around 390,000 and enjoys a mild climate and close proximity to beaches and mountains. Aftershocks are expected to continue to hit the Christchurch region in the coming days and weeks. The usual pattern is for a large aftershock followed by others of diminishing magnitude, said Fry. ""The country is very seismically active. We probably won't see another (aftershock) this big, but there is still a statistical chance,"" Fry cautioned. Dean Irvine contributed to this report .","New Zealand is a globally a very seismically active area; 15,000 quakes each year .

945,"(CNN) -- Cricket officials plan to commemorate the victims of the New Zealand earthquake when the country's national team plays neighboring Australia at the World Cup in India on Friday. Emergency workers are searching for survivors after at least 65 people were killed in a 6.3-magnitude quake in the southern hemisphere nation's second-biggest city Christchurch on Tuesday. ""At times like this, sport can only offer its support and its deepest sympathy to those who have lost loved ones during such a tragedy,"" International Cricket Council chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement. ""It's a helpless feeling but I will be discussing with the organizers of the Cricket World Cup how we can most appropriately remember those who lost their lives or have been injured and affected when the Black Caps play their next match against Australia in Nagpur on Friday."" New Zealand Cricket's headquarters is based in Christchurch, which is reeling from its second serious earthquake in six months. The first in September was stronger but caused no fatalities. It is the South Island's third tragedy in that period, following the mine explosion that killed 29 people in November. ""The news we have is that the NZC offices have been severely damaged but thankfully everyone who works for NZC seems to have escaped without injury,"" Lorgat said. The New Zealand players opened their World Cup campaign on Sunday with a comfortable win over Kenya, but are now preparing for a much more difficult task against four-time champions Australia. ""The greatest thing I think we can do for everyone is win our game against Australia. That'll bring a little bit of light relief to a lot of people going through a tough time,"" captain Daniel Vettori told the NZC website on Tuesday. ""It's been a tough morning. Five or six guys from the team and the management are based in Christchurch. It's been a rough time for them finding out that their families are safe. ""For everyone within the team, they have family or friends in Christchurch so they're feeling it too. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the Canterbury community."" Some of the Kiwi players wrote about the situation on social networking website Twitter. ""Everyone's families are fine. But quite a numb and flat feeling in the squad. Training was tough yet surprisingly the quality very high,"" said Scott Styris. Netherlands captain Peter Borren, who was in action against England in Nagpur on Tuesday, was born in Christchurch and actually played for New Zealand at youth level before switching international allegiances in 2006. ""I managed to get hold of my immediate family, who were all okay, so that was a relief,"" he said at a press conference after the match. ""Obviously it's a tragedy and it's been a tough day back in Christchurch. Hopefully everyone can look after themselves and move on."" Borren scored 35 not out as team lost by six wickets after setting England a victory target of 293 in 50 overs, with Ryan ten Doeschate top-scoring on 119 for the Dutch. England passed that with more than an over to spare, as captain Andrew Strauss led the way with 88 and Jonathan Trott scored 62. The venue for the tournament's April 2 final, Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, has been cleared by fire safety officials following earlier concerns, the Press Trust of India reported Tuesday. Christchurch, meanwhile, is scheduled to host seven matches at the 2011 Rugby World Cup in September and October, including two quarterfinals. The International Rugby Union said it was too early to evaluate whether the city would be able to fulfill its commitments. ""The thoughts and deepest sympathies of the global rugby family are with the people of Christchurch, their families and all New Zealanders at this very difficult time,"" it said in a statement. ""We feel it would be inappropriate to comment at this stage on the status of Rugby World Cup 2011 infrastructure or operations. The focus at this point must be on the emergency response.""","ICC plans memorial for Christchurch earthquake victims at Cricket World Cup match .

946,"(CNN) -- The December death of a 27-year-old woman at the Missouri home of beer tycoon August Busch IV was ruled an accident, a medical examiner said Wednesday. Adrienne Nicole Martin died of an oxycodone overdose, the St. Louis County Office of the Medical Examiner said in a statement. She was found dead December 19 at Busch's Frontenac, Missouri, home, authorities said. The medical examiner's office said that information, and its complete report, was forwarded to the law enforcement agencies investigating Martin's death. Police responded to a call from the home about an unresponsive woman, authorities said. ""This girl is not waking up,"" Michael Jung, a home staff employee at the Busch estate, told the operator. ""Is she breathing""? the 911 operator asked Jung. ""We don't know,"" Jung replied. ""It's dark. I'm going to get a light to see."" The call ended after the operator told Jung an ambulance had been sent to the property. Martin had no apparent signs of trauma or other indications of cause of death, police said. Oxycodone is a narcotic pain medication. Busch's lawyer, Art Margulis, described Martin as a friend of his client's. ""There's absolutely nothing here that would indicate that this occurred under any suspicious circumstances,"" Margulis said at the time. ""It's a tragic death of a ... very nice young lady."" Frontenac, a community of about 3,500 people, is 11 miles west of St. Louis. Martin was a model and aspiring art therapist, described as Native American on her page on iStudio.com, which says it serves ""the modeling, photography, and associated industries."" In the About Me section of her page, she wrote that she had been in beauty pageants for years and ""would really like to do beer advertising."" Busch, 46, became chief executive officer of Anheuser-Busch in December 2006, after years of working in the company's brewing, operations and marking divisions. He was in charge in 2008 when Belgian brewer InBev engineered a $52 billion takeover of the then-St. Louis-based, company. With that move, the combined Anheuser-Busch InBev became the world's largest brewer. That also largely ended the Busch family's long legacy in brewing, namely heading the legendary eastern Missouri institution known for its Budweiser and other brands. The story started with Adolphus Busch, the company founder and August Busch IV's great-grandfather. August Busch IV is the only representative of the family -- and its former namesake company -- on the Anheuser-Busch InBev board of directors.","Adrienne Martin died of an oxycodone overdose, officials say .

947,"(CNN) -- Navy police shot one sailor in the gut and took another into custody early Saturday after their vehicle smashed into two police cruisers following a chase at San Diego's naval base, a military spokesman said. The wounded sailor is in stable condition at the University of California San Diego Medical Center after undergoing surgery, said Brian O'Rourke, the Navy's public affairs officer for the southwest region. The other sailor was uninjured. No charges have been filed against either the driver, who was shot, or his passenger. O'Rourke said that they had been stopped around 1:30 a.m. at a gate outside the San Diego Naval Base on strong suspicions of drunken driving. A gate guard then called for assistance from Navy police units. But before a Breathalyzer could be given, the driver sped inside the base and was soon pursued by military police. The sailors tried to go through another gate, which had been shut down according to protocol, but instead slammed into the security vehicles, O'Rourke said. The passenger then got out of the car, but the driver continued. Naval police officers then opened fire, eventually hitting that sailor in the abdomen. In a statement, the Navy said its police decided to use ""deadly force"" after determining ""the driver represented a threat to the lives of officers."" The passenger is being held on base, the biggest on the West Coast and home to 59 ported ships and thousands of sailors. O'Rourke said police and others at the base just finished a week of security training, preparing them for an incident like this. Formal charges -- which have not yet been specified -- are likely to be filed Monday against the car's driver and possibly its passenger, the spokesman said.","A Navy sailor had surgery and is stable at a hospital after being shot in the abdomen .

948,"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Smoke billowed into the sky over Egypt's capital Wednesday from a fire at the Interior Ministry compound, a blaze witnesses say was set by protesters upset about labor issues. Part of a building, surrounding buildings such as the criminal records building, and several cars had been torched.  Witnesses said the flames could have been ignited by Molotov cocktails. Soldiers and police rushed to scene and a couple of men were detained, the witnesses reported. The compound is three blocks away from Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the sometimes violent clashes that eventually brought down the 30-year regime of President Hosni Mubarak February 11.  Skirmishes also took place near where the fire burned Wednesday. The incident comes as Egyptians continue to work to create the new leadership structure of the country after the revolution. State-run media reported Wednesday that there have been about 1,300 official complaints lodged against former Egyptian ministers and government officials. Interior Minister Mahmoud Wagdi said he ordered that all of the complaints, many of them about government waste and corruption, be investigated, the state-run EgyNews website reported. The investigation comes after Attorney General Abdel Meguid Mahmoud requested that the assets of Mubarak and his family be frozen, according to EgyNews website.  Along with the former president's assets, those belonging to his wife, Suzanne, were also frozen, along with the assets of the former president's eldest son, Alaa, and younger son, Gamal, and both of the sons' wives, according to the report. As CNN correspondent Ivan Watson was filming the aftermath of the fire outside the Interior Ministry Wednesday, an Egyptian military officer with two stars on his epaulets grabbed Watson and demanded he turn over his camera. Watson showed the officer his Egyptian government press accreditation. Saying, ""Be quiet, don't talk!"" the officer dragged Watson away from bystanders and demanded Watson delete video of the incident.  ""If you delete the video, I will let you go free,"" the officer said, identifying himself only as ""Mohammed."" Eventually, another officer intervened, and escorted CNN journalists from the scene. Journalists, especially photographers, routinely have been harassed by Egyptian authorities since protests erupted last month.  Cairo-based photographer Roy Mattieu wrote Wednesday on his Twitter account, ""I've been arrested three times by the army for my camera & lens, afraid to take them out of the bag now, thought it was improving, not."" Egypt has faced a wave of labor unrest since Mubarak was ousted.  Workers at banks, factories, government ministries and at the strategic Suez Canal have gone on strike, demanding better wages and the resignation of executives accused of corruption. Egypt's new military rulers have repeatedly called for an end to the strikes. CNN's Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","Egyptian military officer demands CNN delete footage .

949,"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (CNN) -- A brazen daylight shooting in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on Monday afternoon left four people dead and injured two others, including a 5-year-old boy, a Juarez municipal police spokesman told CNN. Among the dead was a 10-year-old who was nearly decapitated by projectiles from the high-caliber weapon used in the attack, spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. The 5-year-old and the other injured person, 16, were taken to a local hospital where they were being treated for their injuries, police said. Witnesses said an armed man approached their vehicle while it was stopped and opened fire, according to journalist Arturo Chacon. There was no motive for the attack, Sanchez said. Images from the scene showed a white sedan the victims were driving in when they were attacked. The car's side windows were broken and large bullet holes peppered the body of the car. On Sunday, five men were shot and killed at a bar in Juarez, and three others were injured. There are no suspects in either incident. The police offered no other details when asked about the shooting. ""There are no reasons why some days the violence is high and some days the deaths are low in number. This is an ongoing war. It is impossible to try and justify why these things happen here,"" Sanchez said. Journalist Arturo Chacon contributed to this report .","Armed man shoots into stopped car, witnesses say .

950,"(CNN) -- Severe weather descended on the Southeast Monday, killing at least one person, reducing homes to rubble and leaving drivers stranded in flooded streets as the storm system moved northward up the East Coast. One man was killed in Tennessee after being pinned by a trailer that was lifted by strong winds, said Sgt. Chris Guess, a spokesman for the Franklin County Sheriff's Office. A woman in the home was taken to a hospital with back and leg injuries, he said. The winds also downed trees and caused significant damage in the northern part of the county, northwest of Chattanooga, Guess said, adding that the sheriff's office could not yet confirm whether the destruction was due to a tornado. In neighboring Hamilton County, as many as five buildings and several cars sustained damage from high winds, said Bill Tittle, the county's emergency management chief. About 37,000 homes and businesses were without power in the Chattanooga area as of 3 p.m., Lacie Newton of Electric Power Board told CNN affiliate WTVC. Also Monday, two tornadoes touched down in Kentucky, officials said. In Henry County, the twister leveled two homes, leaving nothing behind but foundation and concrete, according to Michael Webb, public information officer for the state police in Campbellsburg, Kentucky. Three people were asleep in one home when it started ""breaking apart,"" Webb said. The residents tried to escape the twister's fury by running from their home to their car, but the car was blown several feet from its parked position and overturned before it slammed into a tree with all three people inside, Webb said. First responders found everyone doing OK when they arrived on the scene, Webb said. Two people in the second home destroyed by the tornado sustained minor injuries from the storm and were treated at a local hospital, he said. Forecasters are warning other states to be on the lookout for damaging winds. Tornado watches remain in effect from Mississippi northeastward through northern Alabama, eastern Tennessee, southwestern and central Virginia and central and eastern Maryland through Monday evening, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. High winds to the east didn't produce any tornadoes, but were strong enough to knock down power lines and damage road signs in St. Louis. The winds that ripped through the state were accompanied by heavy rains that left motorists stuck in their cars on flooded streets in Kansas City, Missouri. To the north, in Ohio, Illinois and Indiana, the scene was similar. Widespread flooding was expected in Indiana and Ohio Monday afternoon, Morris said. Much of the area has seen 2 to 5 inches of rain in the past week, he said. The rising water flooded streets and businesses in and around Cleveland, where a flash-flood warning was issued Monday morning after an operator at Gates Mill Dam on the Chagrin River in Cuyahoga and Lake counties reported that the dam burst. Officials said the river, which was already experiencing major flooding, could rise even more. The raging water from the dam flowed downstream into portions of Willoughby Hills, Willoughby and Eastlake. The rushing water submerged streets and flooded homes. Residents stranded by the high water were being rescued from their homes Monday evening, video from CNN affiliate WBNS showed. Larry Greene, with the Lake County Emergency Management Agency, told CNN affiliate WOIO that property and structure damage estimates won't be available until the water starts to recede, but no injuries were reported from the dam failure. A slight risk of severe thunderstorms continues for portions of middle and eastern Tennessee, northern Alabama, Georgia and as far as western North Carolina. Tornado warnings were issued Monday afternoon and into the evening for the Atlanta metro area as heavy rains and wind moved into the region, according to the National Weather Service. Downed trees were reported in Acworth, about 30 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta. Those thunderstorms could also affect the lower Mississippi Valley east and northeastward to the mid-Atlantic and southeastern Atlantic coasts. Forecasters say a cold front was surging eastward across the area, triggering severe storms and bringing additional rain to Tennessee and Kentucky where flood watches remain in effect through Thursday evening.

951,"London (CNN) -- Passengers struggling to get away for the holiday season faced further frustration and delays Tuesday, as the EU's top travel official slammed snow disruptions across the region as ""unacceptable."" Heavy snow caused severe disruption to train and plane schedules in a number of major cities days before Christmas, forcing thousands of people to sleep in terminals while they waited for information on their onward journey. ""I am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across Europe caused by severe snow. It is unacceptable and should not happen again,"" European Commission Vice President Siim Kallas said in a written statement. He took issue with airport infrastructure which he called the ""weak link"" in the chain, and urged airports to ""get serious"" about planning for severe weather conditions. Thousands of passengers endured another frustrating day at London's Heathrow Airport Tuesday as airlines struggled to clear the backlog of passengers after two days of cancellations. Only one of the airport's two runways was operating, following cancellations during the previous two days due to heavy snow. British Prime Minister David Cameron discussed the weather chaos with his cabinet ""extensively"" Tuesday, according to his office. ""The people stuck here are having an incredibly difficult time, especially just a few days from Christmas, and everything must be done to either get them on holiday or get them home safely,"" Cameron said at a news conference. Kylie Deegennars said she had been sleeping on the terminal floor since arriving at Heathrow late Saturday. ""We got told on that evening that if we waited until 6 a.m. the next morning we'd get more information. We did not get a blanket or a bottle of water until 1:30 a.m. in the morning,"" she said. Conditions hadn't improved since then and Monday night she was still waiting for confirmation of a flight. ""We're younger, we've got resistance, but there are babies, there are elderly people, and they're getting no extra treatment than anyone else. It's disgusting,"" she said. On Tuesday afternoon, British Airways announced that it was considering transporting passengers stranded at Heathrow by bus to other UK airports. Terminal five, it said, had been closed as staff worked to clear the backlog of people crowding the main concourse. London Heathrow is to remain open for the next 24 hours, British Airways said, adding that it was considering bringing planes back overnight to clear the load. Gatwick airport officials indicated Tuesday evening that operations were nearing normal. Nearly 700 flights were scheduled to arrive or depart the airport Tuesday carrying about 100,000 passengers, an airport spokeswoman said, and only 53 flights had been canceled. ""The airfield teams are continuing  to work round the clock and we are in a strong position to get flights moving to as near normal operations later today,"" Gatwick spokeswoman Andrea Hopkins said. The airport has requested additional snow-clearing equipment to be delivered from Switzerland in an effort to make operations fully functional. Colleagues Sharon and Cathy were trying to get back to Phoenix, Arizona, after suffering a two-day delay to their flights from Munich, Germany. They have been stranded at Heathrow airport since Monday. ""We really felt that we were flying into the eye of the storm and it didn't make much sense to do that, but here we are. We've been told our best chance of getting out is on December 27,"" Sharon said. The colleagues say they are ""lucky"" to be put up in a hotel by their company, and expressed sympathy for others stranded in the airport with little or no information, accommodation or money. ""It looks like a refugee camp. People have been staying there for days,"" Sharon said. ""There were guards at the doors of Terminal One not allowing other people to come in. We were a little concerned about leaving the terminal that we might not be able to get back in."" The British government has come under fire for failing to heed warnings about the incoming inclement weather. Defending the government, UK Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said, ""Nobody foresaw the really extreme temperatures that we've had."" He laid the blame for chaos at Heathrow Airport firmly at the door of airport operator BAA who he said made a ""bad call"" on Saturday when the snow first started to present problems. ""This is as a result of extreme weather conditions and also to be frank of a bad call on Saturday by the airport operator who was, as it turned out, over-optimistic about their ability to leave the airport open,"" he said. The government had offered military manpower to help clear runways which had been rejected, Hammond said. He added that the government was working with authorities to ensure the smooth supply of de-icing equipment and other materials to keep the airport operating. British transport expert David Quarmby, author of an independent audit on the resilience of England's transport system, said that the country could not be expected to be able to cope as well as other cities that regularly experience heavy snowfall. ""We had a severe winter last winter and a bit of a winter the year before. But for eight years before that we hardly saw any snow at all,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to justify investing in the resources that you find in airports and rail systems and highways in countries elsewhere which always have winters that are as severe as the one that we've got at the moment."" The travel disruption was not limited to airports. Long queues snaked around St. Pancras International railway station in London on Tuesday as Eurostar canceled 10 trains, or about 20% of its normal service between London and Paris. ""Due to the continuing bad weather, speed restrictions are in place on our high speed lines, adding up to two hours to journey times. As a result we can not operate as many trains as planned,"" said Eurostar spokeswoman Mary Walsh. Passengers ignored advice to turn up at the station one hour before departure. Some queued for as long as four hours in the London drizzle before stepping foot inside the terminal. During the wait, they were offered pizza, curry, coffee and tea, according to CNN's Jim Boulden. Earlier, hundreds of passengers camped at Paris train stations, including Eurostar's Paris terminal, Monday night while they waited news of the next train, French transport minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet told French radio Tuesday. Around 3,000 passengers on cancelled flights slept on the floor at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, while another 400 spent the night at Orly airport, she said. Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, CEO of Air France KLM said efforts had been made to find stranded passengers a hotel room. ""We found 4,000, but we couldn't find anymore,"" Gourgeon told French radio. A message on the Paris airports website said air traffic was ""slowly resuming"" after severe snow disruptions. Passengers were advised to check whether their flights had been cancelled before traveling to the airport. Heavy snowfall halted all plane travel at Frankfurt airport in Germany for a short time Tuesday, said Thomas Uber, an airport spokesman. By mid-morning in Europe, the number of canceled flights had risen to 464, mostly due to backlogs and disruptions at other airports, an official said. About 50 flights had been canceled at Munich airport, also due to disruptions elsewhere. German Transport Minster Peter Ramsauer has asked German state authorities to allow night flights on a case-by-case basis to ease travel chaos at airports. Major German airports have restrictions on night flights usually from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. and only allow night flights on a very limited basis or in cases of emergencies. On Tuesday afternoon Belgian authorities had started putting passengers whose flights had been diverted from Heathrow Airport to Brussels on coaches and boats to London. In a statement posted on its website, the airport advised passengers bound for Frankfurt on Lufthansa flights to make their way independently by train or car. European Commission Vice President Kallas said he would convene a meeting of European airport representatives in coming days to demand an explanation and assurances that they can handle future snow disruptions. ""We have seen in recent years that snow in Western Europe is not such an exceptional circumstance. Better preparedness, in line with what is done in Northern Europe is not an optional extra, it must be planned for and with the necessary investment, particularly on the side of the airports,"" he said. The UK's Met Office, the country's weather forecasting agency, said it is not expecting further snow in London on Wednesday and that Heathrow and Gatwick airports ""should remain dry.""

952,"(CNN) -- Singer Stephen Gately, a member of the Irish band Boyzone, died of natural causes, a court spokeswoman on the Spanish island of Majorca said Tuesday. Stephen Gately died Saturday while he and his partner were visiting the Spanish island of Majorca. The court spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified, said Gately, 33, died Saturday of acute pulmonary edema, according to preliminary autopsy reports. There was no sign of violence in his death, the spokeswoman said. The judge has authorized Gately's family to transfer the body out of Spain, the spokeswoman added. According to the Mayo Clinic, pulmonary edema is caused by excess fluid in the lungs. The fluid collects in the lungs' air sacs, making it difficult to breathe. Gately's partner, Andrew Cowles, testified before an investigating magistrate for about 15 minutes Tuesday, while the autopsy was conducted nearby at the island's forensic institute, the court spokeswoman said. Authorities will send samples from the body to a laboratory in Barcelona. Meanwhile, the court will hear testimony from other witnesses, the court spokeswoman said. The case will be shelved judicially only after the definitive laboratory results have been received, confirming the presumed natural death, the spokeswoman said. Health Library: What is pulmonary edema? In a statement on the Boyzone Web site, Gately's fellow bandmates, Ronan Keating, Keith Duffy, Mikey Graham and Shane Lynch said: ""We are completely devastated by the loss of our friend and brother, Stephen. We have shared such wonderful times together over the years and were all looking forward to sharing many more. ""Stephen was a beautiful person in both body and spirit. He lit up our lives and those of the many friends he had all over the world. Our love and sympathy go out to Andrew and Stephen's family. We love you and will miss you forever, 'Steo.' "" Boyzone made history in the United Kingdom with 16 consecutive Top Five hits, according to Ticketmaster's Web site. It's one of Ireland's best-selling bands, with six No. 1 singles in the United Kingdom, and four No. 1 albums, Ticketmaster said. The group, which separated in 2000 to pursue solo projects, reunited in 2008. Its greatest hits album -- ""Back Again ... No Matter What"" -- was released last year. Gately joined the band in 1993 after answering an audition ad. ""A lot of people didn't think we would make it out of Ireland back then,"" he said previously on the group's Web site. ""We were overwhelmed when Boyzone began to take off, it was incredible."" CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this story.","Boyzone singer Stephen Gately, 33, died Saturday in Majorca .

953,"New York (CNN) -- Subway passengers who were stranded on Coney Island, New York, because of the overnight snowstorm refused to get off of a train because they had no other way to stay warm, riders said Thursday. The passengers stayed in a ""sweeper"" train, which was supposed to clear tracks and make sure no passengers or trains were stuck between stations, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) said. MTA employees tried to get them off the N Train at the Coney Island terminal, a passenger said. ""I said, 'I have no where to go, I'm not leaving,'"" passenger Eva Mahoney told CNN affiliate NY1. ""There's no way I'm gonna get home because I remember the [December] blizzard."" Many of the passengers slept or just waited for a few hours until they could catch a train around 6 a.m., she said. ""If this train is the sweeper train, put us in the one next to it,"" Mahoney said. The drama began when the riders left Manhattan for Brooklyn, NY1 reported. They were told to get off and take the train to Coney Island. When they arrived there was no bus service, passengers said. That's when they decided to stay on the  sweeper train. MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said that, based on December's storm, the agency ""implemented new strategies last night to ensure the safety of passengers and facilitate a quick return to service this morning."" MTA acted to shut down service so as not to strand passengers, he said in a statement. ""In the case of the N Train, we were able to safely park the train at its Coney Island terminal as planned."" The agency could have done a better job communicating with customers ""on the need to dispatch one of the trains as a nonpassenger sweeper train to clear tracks, and making them comfortable in the terminal until service was restored,"" he said. The major snowstorm that pelted much of the Northeast tapered off Thursday, but many schools, government offices and some airport runways were expected to remain closed, officials said. Storms that stretched from the southern Appalachian Mountains to coastal Massachusetts are the latest in a slew of wintry weather that continues to blanket much of the region. Even though the storm lasted a single day, it caused major problems in some areas, posting record snowfall numbers across the region, according to the National Weather Service. In New York's Central Park, 19 inches of snow fell overnight into Thursday, beating a single day record set in 1925, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters. ""Keep an eye on your neighbors,"" he said, warning New Yorkers to check on elderly residents in neighborhoods across the city. Forecasters said Newark, New Jersey, reached 19 inches of snow, while Philadelphia totaled 15 inches. Philadelphia Mayor Michael A. Nutter lifted the city's snow emergency Thursday evening. Bus systems in Philadelphia were running at 10 percent, said mayoral spokeswoman Katie Martin, having been shut down during overnight hours in expectation of the heavy snow fall. Federal employees and most schools in Washington ended business early Wednesday. Public schools and most government offices stayed closed Thursday, officials said. At Philadelphia International Airport, 173 flights were canceled for Thursday as of about 8 a.m., officials said.  About 1,500 passengers were stranded at the airport overnight. At Boston Logan International airport, about 200 flights were canceled Thursday beginning at 6 a.m., officials said. Amtrak suspended service from New York to Boston and from New Haven to Springfield on Thursday, and reduced its service between New York and Albany, the train service said . Runways were closed at Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport in the Washington suburbs on Wednesday evening, said Rob Yingling, spokesman for Metro Washington Airports Authority. ""The intense snow has really been going since late afternoon, and it wasn't too long after that that aircraft activity trailed off dramatically and then subsequently the snow got so heavy that we had to close the runways while we continued plowing them with our snow team,"" Yingling said. But by Thursday afternoon, Dulles airport had reopened a single runway while officials at Reagan National Airport reported they had reopened runways. Also in New York, the city's transit bus service remained suspended in the Bronx, while officials said service is being evaluated and restored on a route by route basis in Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Manhattan, the Metropolitan Transit Authority said Thursday.

954,"(CNN) -- Firefighters battling a central Florida blaze were scrambling to get ahead of gusty winds that could hamper efforts to battle the fire, which has burned more than 16,000 acres and closed a stretch of Interstate 95 for a time Wednesday. The fire, which began Monday in northern Brevard and southern Volusia counties, has destroyed a mobile home, several outbuildings and several camp structures, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said. As of Wednesday, however, ""no residences seem to be in immediate danger,"" said Sterling Ivey, department spokesman. A 21-mile stretch of I-95 in the two counties was shut down for a few hours because of heavy smoke on Wednesday, the Florida Department of Transportation said. It reopened before 4:30 p.m. More than 150 personnel have been deployed to help fight the blaze, called the Iron Horse Fire, according to the Florida Division of Forestry. The fire is 25% contained, said Cliff Frazier, a wildfire mitigation specialist with the Florida Division of Forestry, and has burned 16,294 acres. Winds were pushing much of the smoke out to sea, Frazier said. No new structures appeared to be in danger. Winds of 15 mph were forecast Wednesday morning, increasing to 25 mph by evening, Annaleasa Winter, a Division of Forestry spokeswoman, told CNN affiliate WPBF. The winds will be out of the northeast and could threaten the western fire lines, she said. Firefighters on Wednesday were planning to help ""mop up those edges"" and put out hot spots, Winter said. Mike Townsend's property in Brevard County was among those scorched by the fire. ""It's heartbreaking,"" he told WPBF tearfully. ""I developed this piece of property by myself. It's a rough thing. It's a rough thing to go through."" Firefighters were making progress on a second blaze that has burned close to 2,000 acres in St. Johns County, south of State Road 206 on Interstate 95 below St. Augustine, officials said. Kimberley Prosser of the Brevard County Fire Department said the agency sent two emergency strike teams as a precaution to two communities near the fire, Lake Harney Woods in Volusia County and Blountes Ridge in Brevard County. A voluntary evacuation in the city of Mims was lifted Tuesday evening and shelters were closed, according to the Brevard County Office of Emergency Management. The agency reported a Brevard firefighter suffered second-degree burns to the face. The cause of both fires is not yet known. Frazier said Tuesday the combination of severe freezes this winter that killed surface vegetation and low rain totals made conditions ripe for a fire. The South Florida Water Management District said Wednesday the central and southern portions of the state are experiencing ""extreme dry conditions."" The period between October 2010 and February 2011 was the driest period in southern Florida in 80 years, the district said. ""Over the last five months, the district's 16-county region has received a total of 5.69 inches, less than half the average rainfall for that period, or 6.54 inches below average,"" the district said in a statement. Lake Okeechobee is more than 2 feet below its historical average for this time of year. Meanwhile, residents near the Iron Horse Fire recalled wildfires that swept the area in 1998, saying the recent blaze brings back their worry and anxiety. In 1998, ""We left about 11 o'clock at night and then we didn't know if we had a home the next morning,"" Denise Kemp told WPBF. Her home survived. But she said the current blaze has her worried because of its size and the changing wind directions.

955,"Beijing (CNN) -- China's government will invest $1 billion to combat a three month drought crippling the country's north. The worst drought in six decades threatens to ruin China's winter harvest, the world's largest producer of wheat. To combat it, China's government plans to spend around 6.7 billion yuan ($1.02 billion) to divert water to affected areas and irrigation facilities according to the state news agency, Xinhua. Some 2.57 million people and 2.79 million livestock are suffering from drinking water shortages, Xinhua said. The main affected provinces include Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei and Shanxi, which together account for about 60% of the wheat planted this winter. The United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) issued an alert Tuesday, warning of severe wheat shortages, saying ""the ongoing drought is potentially a serious problem."" According to the FAO the drought is now affecting an area of around 5.16 million hectares, representing two-thirds of China's wheat production. Meanwhile the country's capital Beijing got it first snowfall in more than three months overnight on Wednesday. But the precipitation is unlikely to end the area's drought, reported Xinhua. The precipitation followed cloud seeding by the municipal artificial weather intervention office, the agency said.","NEW: The government invests $1 billion to combat the drought .

956,"Christchurch, New Zealand (CNN) -- The death toll from the 6.3-magnitude earthquake that struck Christchurch this week has risen to 113, police said Friday morning. More people are feared dead, and more than 200 are still missing, police said. Police Superintendent Dave Cliff told reporters that he had ""grave fears"" for the missing and authorities were having difficulty identifying victims because of the condition of the bodies found. The somber announcement came as authorities carried out more house-to-house searches in a desperate hunt for survivors. The quake struck Tuesday, toppling buildings, buckling streets and ripping the facades of iconic churches, including the Christchurch Cathedral and the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. A series of aftershocks followed. Officials said they had given up hope of rescuing at least 100 people who were trapped in the Canterbury TV building in downtown Christchurch. Police said they were ""100% certain"" no one in the building was still alive. Authorities fear that trapped occupants in another structure, the Pyne Gould Corp. Building, are also dead. Among those missing were 27 Japanese students, Japan's foreign ministry said. Most of them were students at language schools, and five were on personal study trips. Kento Okuda, a Japanese student who was pulled from the rubble of the Toyoma Foreign Language College, told Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper that he was having lunch on the fourth-floor cafeteria when the floor gave way. As he and others lay trapped under debris, the students shouted out to each other to get a count of how many of them were alive, Okuda told the newspaper. Many of their fellow Japanese students did not respond. But there have some rare rays of hope in the rescue efforts. One was Anne Vos who was rescued Wednesday from the rubble of the Pyne Gould building in the central business district, according to Australian and New Zealand media. Vos was able to call family members from her cell phone while covered by rubble. ""A couple of hours ago, I thought I'd had it,"" she told New Zealand network TV3 Tuesday. ""I thought it was 'Goodbye Anne.' "" Like some 430 people who have been admitted to emergency rooms since the quake, Vos was taken to a hospital to recuperate. Southern New Zealand has been hit by a series of quakes since September 4 when a 7.1-magnitude temblor struck the area. There were no deaths from that quake, which struck deeper below ground and farther away from Christchurch. Tuesday's earthquake was part of the ""aftershock sequence"" from the September earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey said. CNN's Anna Coren contributed to this report.","Police say they have ""grave fears"" for the missing .

957,"(CNN) -- Heavy winds and dry weather helped set off a rash of fires across a wide swath of north, central and west Texas on Sunday, state forestry officials said. The Texas Forest Service reported 15,000 acres caught fire across the state. The largest concentration of blazes broke out around the west Texas town of Midland and near the panhandle city of Amarillo, where meteorologists reported wind gusts of up to 69 miles an hour. There have been no fatalities, said Lewis Kearney, a spokesman for the forest service's Texas State Lone Star Incident Management Team. However, the high winds made it difficult for firefighters to use aircraft to contain the blazes. Kearney said heavy winds are expected to blow across much of the state into Monday, thus making it more likely that firefighters could be many hours away from dousing the final flames spread by the winds. Kearney said ""numerous homes"" have been burned in west Texas and that firefighters were continuing to battle the blazes as of Sunday night. In Amarillo, the National Weather Service reported that as of 2:32 p.m. CT Sunday afternoon a mandatory evacuation order had been issued in northeast Potter County. A second evacuation order was issued for the city of Borger a half hour later. Throughout the afternoon, fires consumed large swaths of land ranging from 30 to 800 acres in Haskell, Mitchell, Howard, Randall and Tom Green counties, among others.","Roughly 15,000 acres on fire in separate Texas blazes .

958,"(CNN)  -- England's Luke Donald beat new world number one Martin Kaymer by 3&2 to win the snow-hit WGC-Accenture Match Play in Arizona Sunday. Freezing overnight conditions and the unexpected snowfall struck the Dove Mountain course ahead of the 18-hole final, but once it begun it was Donald who warmed to his task from the start. He pulled three clear by the fifth, play briefly held up by a hailstorm which left the players sheltering for cover, and was never headed. But Germany's Kaymer hit back when Donald three-putted the short sixth and a birdie on the par-5 eighth saw the gap cut to just one hole. PGA champion Kaymer drew level as Donald made a hash of the ninth, finding the desert rough with his second,  but that was as close as he got to victory. Donald took the lead again with a birdie on the long 11th, extended it at the next as Kaymer bogeyed and went three-up with a further birdie on the 15th. He closed out the biggest victory of his career on the short 16th and the $1.4 million check. It was his third win on the PGA Tour, but first since 2006, taking him to a career-high number three in the new rankings Monday behind Kaymer and compatriot Lee Westwood. ""It couldn't have gone any better -- not to get to the 18th hole in any match this week and pretty much go through reasonably stress-free,"" Donald told the official PGA Tour website. ""I played solid this week. It's nice to get the victory."" Donald had never trailed throughout his six matches and needed just 73 holes to reach the final, beating Tiger Woods' record of 77. Kaymer will console himself with taking over as No.1 from Westwood, but called Donald a ""very tough opponent"" as he could never get to grips with his Ryder Cup teammate in the cold conditions. In the all-American third place play-off, Matt Kuchar beat Bubba Watson 2&1 in a scrappy match.","Luke Donald wins WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship in Arizona .

959,"(CNN) -- Texas firefighters were making significant progress Tuesday against wildfires that have consumed at least 78 homes and, at their peak, were burning the length of a football field every minute. Sustained winds of 40 mph, gusting to 60, combined with 2% relative humidity in some areas to cause the grass fire conflagration Sunday, said Mark Stanford, chief of fire operations for the Texas Forest Service. On Tuesday, however, firefighters had all 21 remaining fires at least 50 percent contained, Stanford told CNN Radio. Crews want to have them fully contained by Thursday, he said. ""Friday will be another bad day for us,"" Stanford said. ""Not as bad as Sunday, but it will be a very high fire danger day across that region. So we want to make sure that we've freed up all of our fire resources so that they can respond to new starts we may have."" As of Tuesday, 78 homes had been reported destroyed, and that number is expected to increase as teams fan out to inspect damages, Stanford said. None of the fires were threatening communities. Smoke from one fire caused an accident that killed a 5-year-old child Sunday on Interstate 20. Officials believe many of the fires were started by power lines that fell from high winds. Officials are urging citizens to be very cautious with their outdoor activities on fire danger days. One fire was caused by an individual grinding on metal pipe, Stanford said. A blaze in Midland was caused when a vehicle tire blew and the tire rim created sparks. Since Sunday, forestry officials, who were called in to assist local fire departments, have responded to 71 fires covering 136,699 acres, the Texas Forest Service said on its website. Most of the fires were across the Texas Panhandle. The fires occurred in an area of about 45,000 square miles, the size of Kentucky, Stanford said. Two of the biggest active fires were in Randall County, where 26 homes were lost, and Potter County, where 29 homes were lost. Those fires were 80% and 25% contained, respectively. Both were expected to be completely contained by day's end, Stanford said. Potter County Sheriff Brian Thomas said a 61,000-acre fire in his county was ignited when a man cut pipe with a metal grinder in high wind Sunday. Austin Lynn Stephens, 52, was arrested and charged with criminal trespass because he was on private property when he was using the grinder. Firefighters battled blazes in a dozen other counties, including a 35,000-acre fire in Matador West in Motley County, and a 21,000-acre fire in Andrews County, officials said Monday. They also fought fires in the counties of Haskell, Tom Green, Randall, Howard, Midland, Scurry, Motley, Crockett, Mitchell and Eastland. One wildfire destroyed a dog kennel near Amarillo, Capt. Wes Hall of the Amarillo Fire Department said. Authorities were trying to account Monday for the animals missing or dead after the fire tore through the Willow Creek Kennel. Firefighters were able to open cages to free at least some of the dogs before the flames overtook the facility. As many as 27 homes were destroyed in the area and ""the fire was on the kennel in a matter of minutes,"" employee Chance Smith said, adding he did not have an exact number of dogs lost. In the community of Matador, north of Lubbock, families could do nothing but watch as their homes burned to the ground. Juan and Rosemary Segovia hadn't been gone 20 minutes when they returned to a panic-stricken neighborhood and found they had lost everything they owned. ""To know everything you worked so hard for, it's all gone,"" a tearful Juan Segovia told CNN affiliate KCBD. He and his wife stared in disbelief at the blaze. The family of seven is without a home, but grateful for what was not lost. ""I'm glad our family wasn't home when it happened,"" Rosemary Segovia said before falling into her husband's arms. ""That's all I care about is I have my family.""

960,"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- One week after being shot through the head, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is off the ventilator and breathing on her own through a tracheotomy tube, the University Medical Center of Tucson, Arizona, said Saturday. Giffords, who authorities say was the target of a mass shooting by Jared Lee Loughner that left six dead and another 13 wounded, remains in critical condition. Still, in a statement, the southern Arizona hospital said that her recovery ""continues as planned."" Another person wounded in the incident, 58-year-old James Tucker, was released from the hospital Saturday, according to the medical center. Two other victims are in good condition at the hospital, while others wounded had been treated and released earlier this week. The Giffords' development is the latest milestone for a woman who was critically wounded after a bullet went into her skull, through her brain and then back out her skull. Doctors on Saturday morning replaced the breathing tube that ran down her throat with a tracheotomy tube in her windpipe. That procedure protects Giffords' airway and allows her to breath independently for the first time since her first surgery after the shooting, the medical center said. A feeding tube was also inserted earlier Saturday into Giffords, to make it easier for her to get needed nutrients. The hospital said that such procedures are ""not uncommon"" among intensive care patients suffering serious brain injuries. Police say that a gunman -- who they claim is Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson resident -- killed several others in a Safeway parking lot in Tucson while trying to assassinate Giffords, who was then holding a constituent meeting. A law enforcement source said Saturday that Loughner had photographed himself posing with a 9mm handgun while wearing a red G-string. It's not clear when the photo was taken, but it was among those on a roll of 35 mm film that Loughner dropped off at a Walgreen's store in the hours before the shooting rampage. The Safeway where the shooting ocurred reopened Saturday morning for the first time since the incident. Store officials made a public address announcement inviting those who were in the store to step outside for the observation shortly after 10 a.m. MT (12 p.m. ET). Some in the crowd approached flower-bedecked barricades marking the scene and placed flowers. One woman, comforted by another in a green Safeway store apron, sobbed as she attempted to place a lighted candle and a handmade card reading, ""God Loves You."" A wreath was placed at the site to honor the victims, Safeway spokeswoman Susan Houghton said. Damage to the store has been completely repaired, she said. Dr. Michael Lemole, the hospital's chief of neurosurgery, said Friday that Giffords is ""beginning to carry out a more complex sequence"" of activity. ""We're confident (Giffords) is making progress now,"" he said. ""We couldn't have hoped for anything better given the severity of (her) injury."" In a Friday Twitter post, Giffords' husband, NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, thanked his ""great followers"" for their support. ""GG has been improving each day,"" he said. Those killed in last Saturday's attack included a 9-year-old girl, Christina Green; Arizona's chief federal judge, John Roll; and Gabe Zimmerman, a Giffords staffer. Meanwhile, the investigation into the attack continued as authorities on Friday released a detailed timeline of Loughner's activity in the hours before the shooting. A day earlier, they found a bag that is believed to belong to Loughner and contains the same kind of ammunition as was used in the massacre. DNA testing on the bag, which contained seven boxes of 9mm ammunition, could take up to 10 days before the results are determined, according to Pima County Sheriff's Department Capt. Chris Nanos.

961,"(CNN) -- The number of people missing after flash floods swept cars off roads in the eastern Australian city of Toowoomba rose to more than 70 on Monday, with eight people confirmed dead, police in the state of Queensland reported. The latest flooding hit Toowoomba, about 125 kilometers (80 miles) west of the state capital Brisbane and considerably south of other areas hit by recent floods. The Queensland Police Service confirmed that 72 people are now missing in the areas of Toowoomba and Lockyer Creek, and Chantelle Rule-Murphy, spokesperson for Emergency Management Queensland, said eight people have now been confirmed dead. iReport: Are you there? Share your photos, video . Toowoomba is the biggest inland city in Queensland, a region that was already reeling from one of the worst floods in its history. Authorities there are conducting several search-and-rescue operations, and Australia's military has committed four helicopters to those efforts, Rule-Murphy said. ""A lot of places are in high alert and we still expect a good deal of rain, so we are still not out of the woods yet,"" Queensland police spokesman Ben Tracy said. Since November 30, the seasonal flooding in Queensland has caused rivers to spill over their banks and reach record levels. At least 200,000 people have been affected, and heavy rains are expected to continue moving into Tuesday.

962,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Toyota on Wednesday announced recalls involving more than 1.5 million vehicles worldwide for issues that could result in fuel leakage, the company said. One recall involves about 1.2 million units of 16 models -- including the Noah and other models -- within Japan and 140,000 Avensis and Tourer models overseas because of faulty fuel pipes that could cause fuel leakage, according to the company. A separate recall involves 245,000 2006 through 2007 Lexus GS300/350 vehicles, 2006 through early 2009 Lexus IS250 vehicles and 2006 through early 2008 Lexus IS350 vehicles sold in the United States to inspect the fuel pressure sensor installation, according to a company statement. ""Due to insufficient tightening of the fuel pressure sensor connected to certain engine fuel delivery pipes ... there is a possibility that the pressure sensor could loosen over time,"" the statement said. ""Lexus dealers will inspect the vehicle for fuel leakage and if no leakage is found, will tighten the fuel pressure sensor with the proper torque. If a fuel leak is confirmed, the gasket between the sensor and the delivery pipe will be replaced and the sensor will be tightened with the proper torque."" The inspection and possible gasket replacement will be conducted at no charge to the vehicle owner, according to the company statement. Toyota said no accidents have been reported in relation to the recalls.

963,"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli police arrested two suspects Saturday in connection to a deadly wildfire raging in the country's north, though a police spokesman said it appears the fires started out of negligence. The fires have killed 41 and injured 17 others. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the suspects are being questioned at a local police station but police now believe the fires were due to negligence rather than arson. As the police probe unfolded, firefighters continued to battle three major blazes fueled by shifting winds. The fire, the worst in Israel's history, is still not under control, Rosenfeld said. The flames spread over 10,000 acres around Haifa, Israel's third largest city, threatening businesses, tourism and one of Israel's greenest regions, Mount Carmel. ""If you look over the hills at Haifa, you can see smoke billowing over the sea,"" said Rosenfeld, adding that the winds have forced authorities to close down roads to the coastal area. About 17,000 people have been evacuated, but residential areas are not under threat, he said. On Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to the help Israel received from other nations, including Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, as ""heartwarming,"" the Jerusalem Post reported. ""One thing is clear, the Israeli people are standing together and many, many countries are together with Israel. This is no small thing,"" Netanyahu said during a press conference. ""This is surely a point of light in this our festival of lights Hanukkah,"" he said. Israeli's military noted in a statement Saturday that firefighters from Bulgaria and Greece had joined Israeli personnel on the blaze's frontlines. Netanyahu's office said that so far, several nations have committed 10 airplanes and three helicopters to help Israel fight the raging fire, including four from Greece, one from Cyprus, two from Turkey, two from Russia and one from France. These are in addition to several Israel Defense Forces aircraft, including two to four charged with surveying the region from above. British Prime Minister David Cameron instructed the Royal Air Force to deploy two helicopters from Cyprus to help put out the fire, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Friday. Netanyahu spoke Saturday morning with the president of Switzerland to recruit additional air support, his office said. Five U.S. Defense Department aircraft will leave for Israel this weekend to help fight the fire. They include three C-130 firefighting aircraft from the U.S. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard and two C-130s from the U.S. European Command, which will depart Ramstein Air Base in Germany carrying 20 tons of fire retardant, the U.S. Agency for International Development said. The agency said it has already chartered commercial aircraft to deliver 45 tons of fire retardant and 12,000 liters of foam to suppress the flames. A team of experts from the U.S. Forest Service's Disaster Assistance Support Program is also heading to Israel, the agency said. Hague expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and to the thousands who have had to be evacuated because of the blaze. ""This tragedy is all the more sad as it comes as the Jewish community around the world celebrates Hanukkah, a time of hope and joy,"" Hague said. ""The UK will continue to do whatever it can to help."" Two funerals took place Saturday after another eight were held Friday for those killed, Rosenfeld said. Most of the 41 victims were cadets in Israel's prison service who arrived Thursday to help evacuate 500 inmates from the Damon prison near Haifa. Among the dead, 40 were apparently burned alive when their bus, traveling along a narrow mountain road, was engulfed by the fast-moving blaze, the Jerusalem Post reported. In an interview with the newspaper, a firefighter spokesman said the bus was gone in less than three minutes. ""The bus had no chance. They tried to escape but were burned alive,"" the spokesman said. ""It was a horrific scene."" The IDF said the victims will be buried with full honors in military ceremonies. Israeli firefighter spokesman Yoram Levy said shifting 29 kph (18 mph) winds made the inferno harder to control as flames neared a neighborhood in Haifa, a major tourist destination on the northern coast. Built on the slopes of Mount Carmel about 50 miles north of Tel Aviv, Haifa's metropolitan area is also host to historical sites that date to Biblical times. The fire has also threatened a sensitive ecological area near the Hai Bar nature reserve. Known as Mount Carmel's ""Little Switzerland,"" the reserve is home to a wildlife preservation project that seeks to bring back native species mentioned in the Old Testament. Though Israel is known for its military might, it has been criticized for failing to properly handle the blazes.

964,"(CNN) -- Formula One legend Jackie Stewart is recovering in hospital after falling ill whilst flying back from attending the Geneva Motor Show. The 71-year-old Scot-- who won the world drivers' title in 1969, 1971 and 1973 -- was given medical assistance by cabin crew after passing out on the flight, before being taken by ambulance to Hillingdon Hospital in west London. Stewart's son Paul told the BBC: ""I've just spoken to him in hospital. He seemed absolutely fine but obviously something happened and we need to establish what. ""I should think he'll just be checked over and hopefully it will be nothing more sinister than that."" Confirming Stewart's arrival, a hospital spokeswoman told reporters: ""Jackie Stewart was taken unwell on a flight to Heathrow. At the moment he is undergoing check-ups and his condition is stable."" Meanwhile, Stewart's private secretary, Oliver Anderson, added: ""Jackie is fully conscious and having precautionary medical checks. We are expecting a full recovery from him."" As well as his three world titles, Stewart won 27 races during a Formula One career between 1965 and 1973. He also ran his own Stewart team from 1997-1999, winning one race.","Formula One legend Jackie Stewart is recovering in hospital after falling ill .

965,"(CNN) -- More than 170,000 homes are without power in Queensland after a massive cyclone slammed into the already flood-ravaged northern Australian state, according to the emergency services minister. Some areas could be without power for weeks. Neil Roberts told CNN that said that no serious injuries have been reported since Tropical Cyclone Yasi roared ashore, but emergency crews are still working their way across the affected region. So far, the worst-hit towns seem to be in an area roughly 90 miles (150 kilometers) south of Cairns, he said. Cyclone was 'absolutely terrifying' Queensland Premier Anna Bligh described conditions for local TV networks, and said that many coastal cities are enduring power outages. In Cairns, only 34% of homes had electricity. Townsville, south of Cairns, only has power in about 15% of homes. Farther down the Queensland coast, electricity is out in half of Mackay and Proserpine, and the entire town of Ingham was without power. Bligh said the tens of thousands of power outages were caused by downed lines and a transmission break. Electrical supply lines running into coastal communities have been cut south of the town of Innisfail. ""It is not clear yet why it has been cut and we won't know until we are able to get into the air and check all along that system,"" Bligh said. ""I should say that requires checking 400 kilometers (248 miles) of line and 500 transmission towers."" It could take weeks to repair the problems, Bligh said, an assessment affirmed by Queensland's emergency services minister. Tropical Cyclone Yasi is now a Category 2 storm, significantly diminished but still able to bring strong winds and heavy rain into interior areas of the country, according to CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. Yasi is moving toward the west. Wind speeds could reach up to 77 miles per hour (125 kilometers per hour) and very heavy rains could cause localized flooding Thursday and in days to come, she said. Joe Vella, a resident of Cairns, said that wind gusts when Yasi came ashore sounded like a sledgehammer hitting his house -- and that it went on for four hours. ""Our hearts were in our throats thinking what was going to happen,"" he told CNN. Tropical Cyclone Yasi made landfall late on Wednesday night, local time, as powerful Category 5 storm, the highest designation on Australia's classification system. Thousands of people left their homes ahead of the storm, which forecasters warned was one of the worst the country has ever seen. Earlier, Queensland's Premier, Anna Bligh, warned residents they may have to cope alone for several days. ""I can't sugarcoat this for people. It's going to be a tough 24 hours. For some it's going to be a tough couple of days,"" she said at a news conference. ""They need to prepare for the worst-case scenario, and that might mean they have to be self-sufficient for a couple of days. Carl Butcher, another Cairns resident, said before the storm, ""I have all my rations ready to go, batteries, candles. The authorities have been very proactive in informing us about this system. We have known about it for a week. That is more than enough time to prepare for it."" CNN Meteorologist Jennifer Delgado said heavy rain in Queensland could continue until Friday. There are serious concerns for six adults in Port Hinchinbrook, who apparently ignored advice to evacuate the storm surge zone before calling to request help from the emergency services. Police, who are in contact with them via telephone, said the group are currently hunkered down on the second floor of an apartment block, but the tidal surge is expected to reach the top of the first floor. The state's premier, Anna Bligh, had urged residents in the threatened areas to take sensible precautions and to stay inside once the storm hit. ""It will be a display of the awesome power of nature, but it is not something you want to go outside and watch,"" she said. The cyclone threatens more devastation for Queensland, where 20 people died and thousands of homes were wrecked in severe flooding in January, which affected 3.1 million people. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has announced a one-off tax aimed at helping to for pay the estimated AUS $5.6 billion (US $5.58 billion) in damage caused by that flood. CNN's Pauline Chiou, Hilary Whiteman and Bryony Jones contributed to this report.","NEW: Queensland emergency minister: More than 170,000 homes are without power .

966,"(CNN) -- Two sailors were killed and a third injured during a training exercise at California's Camp Pendleton on Monday morning, according to a spokesman. The accident occurred at 8 a.m. when the 7-ton bulk water tanker the sailors were driving rolled over, said Cmdr. Greg Hicks, a U.S. Navy 3rd Fleet spokesman. Hicks said the names of the victims are being withheld until their families can be notified. Meanwhile, the injured sailor was taken to a nearby hospital where he is listed in stable condition, Hicks said. The U.S. Marine Corps will conduct the investigation because it happened on their base, he said. A Marine Corps instructor was killed during a January 14 training exercise at Camp Pendleton when the amphibious assault vehicle he was riding in capsized and sank.","Vehicle rolls over during a training exercise at California's Camp Pendleton .

967,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Some 200 houses were damaged in a southwestern province of Pakistan after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 struck Wednesday, officials said. The mud-walled houses were damaged in districts close to the epicenter, said Ahmed Kamal, spokesman for the country's National Disaster Management Authority. Hundreds of tents, blankets and ready-to-eat meals were sent to the affected area, he said. The earthquake occurred at 1:23 a.m. Wednesday (3:23 p.m. Tuesday ET) at a depth of 84 kilometers (52 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey said. It was centered 45 kilometers (30 miles) west of Dalbandin, and 1,035 kilometers (640 miles) west-southwest of Islamabad, the USGS said on its website. There were no reports of injuries or deaths, Kamal said. The United States, China and Australia had offered aid to Pakistan, but it had not been initially accepted, Kamal said. ""The offer was appreciated but not accepted because its not required yet,"" he said. Arif Mahmood, director of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, put the epicenter at 320 kilometers (about 200 miles) southwest of Quetta near Kharan, Balochistan, and said it had been felt in Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan provinces in Pakistan, as well as parts of Iran and India. Mahmood predicted major aftershocks. ""Earthquakes with such magnitudes in the past have brought on aftershocks,"" he told CNN from Islamabad. An official at Quetta's Civil Hospital said a female cardiac patient suffered a fatal heart attack during the earthquake. He said two residents raced to the hospital but they proved not to have been injured, just scared. Malik Muhammad Iqbal, the police chief of Balochistan province, said he was aware of no injuries. ""Things in the headquarters started shaking and books fell off the desks,"" Balochistan Police Inspector Sultan Mehmood told CNN in a telephone interview. ""We left the headquarters running into the streets -- scared for our lives."" In Karachi, Faraz Leghari, director general police, said he had heard no immediate reports of casualties or building damage. USGS initially reported the quake at 7.4. Quakes of 7.0 to 7.9 are classified as major; anything over 8.0 is classified as great. In Dubai, about 500 miles southwest of the epicenter, a reporter said he felt a moderate shaking that lasted for about 30 seconds. Usman Zahid, a night manager at Serina Hotel in Quetta, Pakistan, felt the quake. He said it was ""frightening"" and estimated that it lasted about 20 seconds. It left ""broken glass in the kitchen"" and made a chandelier swing, but caused no major damage, he said. People with Twitter accounts in New Delhi, Jaipur and Dehradun -- all in India -- felt the quake. People with Twitter accounts in Bahrain said they felt the quake. In Dubai, ""I was just getting ready to go to bed,"" said Leone Lakhani. She said she texted her friends in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain. ""It's not uncommon for this region to have earthquakes,"" said Kurt Frankel of the Georgia Institute of Technology. It is where two tectonic plates come together, he said.

968,"(CNN) -- Utility companies will return Sunday to restore power in parts of Rayne, Louisiana,  after a tornado pummelled the region, killing at least one person. A Louisiana mother who died sheltering her child during the tornado was identified early Sunday as Jalisa Granger, a sheriff's office official said. The 21-year-old's body was found by ""a family member who lived nearby"" who went to check on her, said Maxine Trahan, a spokeswoman for the Acadia Parish Sheriff's Office in Rayne, Louisiana, adding that the ""child was OK."" Granger was killed when a tree fell on her house in the storm. Eleven people were injured, she said. ""There's a lot of damage out there,"" Trahan said. ""Most residents were evacuated, leaving for other relatives' homes. About 20 (who were) evacuated didn't have somewhere to go, but were taken to the local fire department."" Utility companies will be returning to the area Sunday morning to help restore power, she said. The storm that killed Granger was one of at least two twisters tied to a weather system that has caused major damage in the state and wreaked havoc on Mardi Gras festivities. The National Weather Service confirmed that tornadoes hit the city of Rayne, about 80 miles west of Baton Rouge, and the nearby city of Crowley on Saturday morning. Packing winds between 111 and 135 mph, the tornado was 300 yards wide and produced damage over a 5-mile stretch, according to the weather service. The northwest section of Rayne was especially hard hit, with video from CNN affiliate KATC showing several buildings leveled, lots reduced to rubble and large trees knocked down. Petijean said the city's electricity infrastructure was badly damaged, with power going out for all its 10,000 residents soon after the tornado came through. In addition, several houses were knocked off their foundations and there were reports of gas leaks, which led to mandatory evacuations of about 1,500 residents in the city's northwest, Petijean said. The mayor said a curfew was imposed in part of the city, with people asked to stay indoors until 6 a.m. Sunday while authorities check to ensure all is safe. Some of those evacuated are being cared for by the Red Cross. The impact zone is an area about one to two square miles, said Rayne police dispatcher Whitney Thibodaux. Among the buildings affected were a public housing units and Rayne High School, with damage to the computer room, library and gym. Three people, meanwhile, suffered injuries when the twister hit Crowley, according to the National Weather Service. Debris was reported along a 2-mile-long damage path on Interstate 10, and there was damage to a Waffle House, car wash and several residences. About 150 miles to the east, meanwhile, revelers and residents of New Orleans were soaked much of Saturday as steady rains fell on the city. This weekend -- the last one before Ash Wednesday -- is traditionally one of the busiest in The Big Easy, with people partying and enjoying Mardi Gras festivities. The weather forced several changes to the Mardi Gras schedule, including the delay of the Krewe of Endymion parade from Saturday to Sunday, according to a release from the New Orleans Police Department. Other parade-related festivities were pushed up to start earlier Saturday, given the rain-soaked forecast for Saturday afternoon and beyond. The rain stopped later Saturday in New Orleans and the weather service's forecast called for sunny conditions Sunday, with high temperatures in the lower 60s. A flood advisory remains in effect through Monday morning for numerous communities along the Mississippi River, including parts of Chicot and Desha counties in Arkansas; Adams, Bolivar, Isaquena, Washington, Madison and Wilkinson counties in Mississippi; and Claiborne, East Caroll, Jefferson, Tensas and Warren parishes in Louisiana. There were also flood warnings in effect for the Atchafalaya River at Morgan City, Louisiana, through Sunday afternoon; the Tchefuncte River in Covington, Louisiana, through Monday at noon; and the Bogue Falaya River at Camp Covington, Louisiana, through Tuesday morning. CNN's Rick Martin, Craig Bell, Tina Burnside and Jacqui Jeras contributed to this report.","Jalisa Granger, 21, dies when a tree hits her house in Louisiana, the sheriff's office says .

969,"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- Rising floodwaters cut off the last ground route into the eastern Australian city of Rockhampton on Monday, as police pegged the number of people affected by prolonged flooding at 200,000. Flooding also put increasing pressure on the southern Queensland cities of St. George and Surat, even as floodwaters receded in the communities farther to the north, including Emerald. Police said ten people have died as a result of flooding since November 30. The latest fatality involved an occupant of a car that tried to cross flooded ground between Muttaburra and Aramac in western Queensland, according to police. Police have not recovered the man's body, but they presume he drowned after the car was swept away by swift waters Sunday. Two other people in the car were rescued unharmed. Police, emergency services and military crews continued working to resupply Rockhampton and other communities with supplies, even after the last road leading into the town succumbed to flooding, acting Assistant Police Commissioner Alistair Dawson said. Although the regional airport is flooded, helicopters ferrying supplies are landing on a dry portion of runway. Resupplying the city of 75,000 is crucial, he said. ""We think that Rockhampton could be isolated probably for anywhere along about a week or so,"" he said. The airport, which closed Sunday, is expected to remain closed for weeks, according to Emergency Management Queensland. The seasonal flooding afflicting Queensland intensified about a week ago after monsoon rains caused rivers to spill their banks and reach record levels. Forecasters said it could be days before conditions improve. Water levels were expected to crest at 9.4 meters (31 feet) in Rockhampton on Wednesday, CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said. In Emerald, north and west of the current flooding threat, waters have begun to recede even though thousands of homes still have floodwater nearby, Dawson said. ""It's a slow journey for these people, and it's a heartbreaking journey,"" Dawson said. Dawson warned residents who have been allowed to return to their homes about placing valuables outside to dry, saying some people could be tempted to take such items. He also warned would-be thieves against such acts, noting additional police have been deployed to affected communities. Dawson also warned people not to drive through flooded communities, saying that could produce waves that could push water into homes that have so far escaped interior damage. Emergency officials said they are working with their counterparts in other Australian states to bring in crews to assist with the flooding and relieve Queensland employees and volunteers fatigued by days of working the floods. Prime Minister Julia Gillard urged residents to stay away from floodwaters. On Friday she toured the devastation and said the flooding in Queensland will cost ""hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.""

970,"(Health.com) -- Donna Landrigan had been acting strangely for almost a month. Weeks of pounding, wall-to-wall headaches had left the normally calm and confident 35-year-old mother of three feeling confused, anxious, and doubting. ""She couldn't function,"" recalls Dan Landrigan, Donna's husband. ""She couldn't do anything, and she had these really intense levels of paranoia."" Over-the-counter medications did nothing to relieve her headaches, and visits to the doctor and a local emergency room were similarly fruitless. Donna's state of mind continued to deteriorate. The breaking point finally came on a December night in 2008, when she stood in the middle of the kitchen floor and screeched at the top of her lungs. ""It was a bloodcurdling scream,"" Dan recalls. Later that night, Dan found his wife slumped on the concrete floor of the garage, moaning. That chilling evening marked the beginning of a medical odyssey that would ultimately involve four hospitals, experts in three states, and 10 months of guessing, testing, doubting, and hoping. Something was attacking Donna's brain. She'd spend five months in a drug-induced coma before doctors knew what it was. Health.com: Your life-saving guide to bad headaches . Buying time . An ambulance rushed Donna to the ER after she collapsed, but she was quickly transferred to the intensive-care unit (ICU) at nearby Highland Hospital, in Rochester, New York. Neurologist Nick Johnson, M.D., was there when she arrived. ""She was psychotic and required restraints, both physical and emotional,"" Johnson says, referring to tranquilizers. ""She was trying to hurt herself and the people around her."" Johnson was perplexed. After hearing her symptoms, he at first suspected encephalitis, a swelling of the brain usually related to an infection. He tested Donna for more than a hundred viruses and bacteria that can cause the condition, but everything came back negative. In no state to return home, Donna was admitted to the hospital for tests and observation. Two weeks later, Johnson and his team had a breakthrough when an electroencephalogram, or EEG, revealed recurring seizures in Donna's brain that were unaccompanied by physical symptoms -- a serious condition, known as nonconvulsive status epilepticus, that kills 56 percent of the people it affects. But their relief at having finally arrived at a diagnosis was short-lived; the seizures failed to respond as expected to a slew of drugs. Health.com: 20 medical mysteries and miracles . Shortly thereafter, Dan walked into the hospital to visit his wife and found her bed empty. Unbeknownst to him, doctors had used a powerful anesthetic to put Donna in a coma and had transferred her to an ICU on another floor. ""The doctors explained to me that if they continued to let her brain seize like that, it would eventually wear out and start shutting down,"" Dan says. ""They induced the coma. That was the only way they could buy more time to seek and find out what was wrong."" As Dan remembers it, the scene that greeted him when he saw Donna in a coma for the first time was like something out of ""ER"" or ""Grey's Anatomy, ""not real life. ""It was kind of freaky,"" he says. ""You don't expect to see that with a loved one. Everything just comes slamming right at you. It's very overwhelming to walk in and witness it alone."" Health.com: TV doctors bring unethical behavior to prime time . An elusive tumor . By mid-January, Donna's condition hadn't improved, and she was transferred to a larger facility in Rochester. The doctors at Strong Memorial Hospital decided to take a more aggressive approach, deepening her coma with the drug pentobarbital. But after six weeks Donna was even worse. Her blood pressure had plummeted and she had developed hypothermia -- common complications of lying in the ICU for so long. ""I still have the image of walking into the room and seeing despair on the nurses' faces,"" says Dan, who visited Donna on all but four days during the ordeal. ""I got terrified that maybe we were taking a turn for the worse."" In reality, the doctors were getting warmer. They began to speculate that an antibody produced by Donna's own immune system -- a protein that usually fights disease -- was damaging her brain. To confirm their hunch, they sent samples of Donna's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota. The test results provided a glimmer of hope: Pathologists had found an antibody -- they just didn't know what it was. Health.com: 'Indescribable, crazy pain': I survived dengue fever . Experts at the University of Pennsylvania eventually identified the mysterious antibody as a type that targets receptors in the central nervous system that are involved in memory and neuron function. (The antibody can also attack nerve cells in the brain, which would explain Donna's seizures.) These so-called anti-NMDA receptor antibodies usually arise in response to a type of tumor called a teratoma. Teratomas tend to appear in ovaries and testes and can contain cells and tissues of all kinds, even embryonic body parts such as hair and teeth. Once again, the doctors' optimism waned quickly as they struggled to locate the tumor. Meanwhile, chemotherapy had no apparent effect. Even though they couldn't find a tumor, the doctors decided that the only remaining option to save Donna's life was to remove her ovaries and hope for the best. A few days after Donna underwent surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes, Dan got a call on his cell phone from one of Donna's doctors. ""We found a tumor,"" she told him, sounding choked up. It was indeed a teratoma, a benign but messy jumble of hair cells, nerve tissue, and teeth. The antibodies created by Donna's body to fight the nerve tissue in the teratoma were inadvertently attacking healthy tissue in her brain. With that, Donna became one of about 100 people in the world to be diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. In many ways her case is typical. The vast majority of patients who develop this rare condition are women, and most experience psychiatric symptoms, memory problems, and seizures. Ovarian teratomas are the culprit in most cases, but not all. But no one has experienced seizures for as long as Donna did and survived, according to Johnson. A slow recovery . Once the tumor was removed, Donna's doctors started the slow, painstaking process of tapering off the drugs and bringing her out of her five-month coma. On Memorial Day 2009, Donna awoke briefly and smiled when she heard the nurses in her room mention French fries. ""Donna, do you like French fries?"" they asked her. She mouthed the word ""yes."" Donna took about four weeks to become fully alert and conversant. Her first memory upon waking, she says, was hearing that Michael Jackson was dead. (Ironically, Jackson suffered cardiac arrest after overdosing on propofol, the drug that Donna's doctors used to induce her coma.) It was June 2009, and she remembered nothing since October of the previous year. Health.com: Michael Jackson's death: why cardiac arrest is deadlier than heart attack . The seizures have stopped, but Donna, now 36, is still struggling with the aftereffects of the coma. Now, more than a year after waking up, she is at home but in a wheelchair, suffering from nerve damage and muscle spasms. She had hoped that she would be walking by now. ""I like to believe it's temporary,"" she says. Three-quarters of the people who have contracted anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis have recovered fully or with minor neurological problems. Johnson, who took care of Donna for the duration of her illness, is grateful that she seems well on her way to joining that group. ""This was a very unusual outcome, especially for someone with seizures that long,"" he says. Copyright Health Magazine 2010 .","Donna Landrigan spent five months in a drug-induced coma .

972,"(CNN) -- A quick-hitting Northeast snowstorm that began coating the nation's capital Wednesday has forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights for travelers in New England and the Eastern Seaboard, according to airline spokesmen. Winter storm warnings were in effect Wednesday from the southern Appalachian mountains to coastal Massachusetts and were expected to expire Thursday morning, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. Snow was falling about an inch an hour in Washington, D.C., which was expected to receive 4 to 6 inches Wednesday evening, he said. Federal employees and most schools in Washington ended business early on Wednesday. New York is expected to receive 8 to 12 inches of snow starting about midnight, Morris said. Boston should also see 8 to 12 inches, with the heaviest snow falling Thursday morning, he said. Nashville and central Tennessee got 2 to 4 inches of snow Wednesday, Morris said. The snowfall was even prompting airlines to pre-emptively cancel flights. Among the biggest cancellations were Delta Airlines' 575 flights between Washington, D.C., and Boston, said spokesman Anthony Black. American Airlines/American Eagle spokesman Ed Martelle said the two airlines cancelled 280 flights for Wednesday and 65 more are cancelled for Thursday between Washington, D.C., and Boston. United cancelled 276 flights Wednesday and proactively cancelled 71 more for Thursday, and Continental cancelled 322 flights Wednesday and 108 more for Thursday, said Christen David, spokesman for both airlines. Southwest Airlines canceled more than 100 flights Wednesday in the Northeast, said spokeswoman Brandy King. Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley wants people to stay off the roads. ""This is a serious traffic hazard and challenge,"" O'Malley said at a press briefing from the state's operation center in Hanover. Maryland officials said 1,600 maintenance workers and 1,400 pieces of equipment would be on the roads all night battling the storm. The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for the area until early Thursday morning. Snow accumulations could reach 10 inches. One problem that could hamper snow removal is the lack of sand and chemical preparation for roadways, due to the recent heavy rains. ""We have not been able to successfully pretreat the surfaces,"" O'Malley told reporters after a briefing with Maryland public safety and transportation officials. Maryland has not activated the National Guard, but they are ready for deployment if needed, officials said. In Florida, the National Weather Service has dispatched survey teams to investigate damage caused by storms that moved across the state Tuesday evening. They found that a tornado near Boca Raton had snapped and uprooted trees, CNN meteorologist Morris said. In St. Petersburg, Florida, 90 mph straight-line winds damaged a gas station and injured one person, Morris said. A tornado near Alva, Florida, destroyed and damaged six mobile homes, and straight-line winds between 60 and 90 mph damaged several homes near Groveland, Florida, Morris said. This snowstorm comes after many had just dug themselves out of a blizzard that walloped the Northeast earlier this month. The storm that hit in early January closed hundreds of schools, stopped the rail system between New York City and points north for days and grounded hundreds of flights. Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont reached up to 30 inches, while most areas got 8 to 16 inches of snow.

973,"(CNN) -- A vast winter storm on Tuesday blasted much of the nation with nearly horizontal blowing snow, cloaking trees and power lines with ice up to an inch thick, forcing airports to close and complicating the travel plans of fans headed to this weekend's Super Bowl in Texas. A mix of blizzard, ice, hard freeze and high wind warnings sprang up across most of the Lower 48 states as the system pressed eastward, from New Mexico to Maine. Forecasters said as many as 100 million people in the United States would feel its effects. Blizzard warnings were up late Tuesday in eight states -- from eastern Kansas to western Ohio. The mass of frigid precipitation, in its relentless northeasterly march, formed an arc that was centered in the Great Lakes region and stretched from northeastern Kansas in the west to the edge of Chesapeake Bay in the east. The stem of the storm brought needed rain to much of the Southeast, but unwelcome ice and hard freeze warnings in other places, as far south as Corpus Christi, Texas. Parts of the Florida Panhandle, southwestern Georgia and southeastern Alabama were under a tornado watch. High-wind warnings were posted in eastern Tennessee and western Virginia, with gusts of 55 mph forecast in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The National Weather Service forecasts and advisories through Wednesday night read like the Abominable Snow Monster's Christmas list: Up to 14 inches of snow in South Bend, Indiana, with winds up to 30 mph; Up 13 inches of snow and a low of 12 below zero in Ottumwa, Iowa; as much as 13 inches of new snow in Berlin, New Hampshire, by Wednesday night; hard freeze warnings in Houston and Galveston, Texas. In Chicago, part of a fiberboard roof panel behind home plate at Wrigley Field, home of the baseball Cubs, broke away in the high wind, the ball club said. Police roped off nearby streets and sidewalks as a precaution, the club said. Drifting and blowing snow closed parts of interstate highways in Oklahoma and Missouri, while police in St. Louis stopped patrolling in advance of the worst of a storm that was expected to leave as much as 30 inches of snow in parts of Missouri and Illinois, and up to an inch of ice in places. ""Do not travel! Stay inside!"" the National Weather Service warned. ""Strong winds and blinding snow will make travel nearly impossible. This is a life-threatening storm."" Ice is the larger threat in a band that extended from south of St. Louis to western Connecticut and parts of New Jersey. In those regions, more than an inch of ice could accumulate, downing trees and power lines. All of western Maryland was under a freezing rain advisory. An ice storm warning covered 29 counties in central and southern Indiana. In the city of Greenwood, a command center was set up to deal with downed trees and other hazards that might impede first responders during emergencies. By Tuesday evening, a quarter-inch of ice had accumulated on trees in the area, with at least a half-inch expected, Fire Chief James Sipes told CNN affiliate WAVE of Louisville, Kentucky. ""The last time we had an event of this nature was in 1988,"" Sipes said, ""and it caused substantial damage."" The nasty weather is even threatening festivities surrounding the Super Bowl, set for Sunday in Dallas. Icy conditions forced Dallas-Fort Worth Airport to temporarily close Tuesday morning. The airport reopened after a two-hour closure with one runway in operation, airport officials told CNN. Nearby Love Field was also forced to close and was expected to reopen by 2 p.m. (3 p.m. ET). ""We had thunderstorms, we had rain, we had freezing rain, ice pellets, sleet -- the only thing we didn't have was hail and sunshine,"" said Ed Martelle, the spokesman for AMR Corp., which owns American Airlines. In Illinois, all major thoroughfares from I-70 and further north were covered with -- or had patches of -- ice and snow, according to the state Department of Transportation. In Missouri, whiteout conditions forced the closure of I-70 through the middle part of the state. ""This is not a good time to be on the road,"" Missouri highway department official Don Hillis said. ""Almost all of the state is covered with snow and some areas are receiving ice, making some roads impassable."" The Oklahoma Department of Public Safety reported that westbound Interstate 40 in Seminole and Okfuskee counties was closed Tuesday afternoon with 4-foot snow drifts. The department said some arterial roads and all secondary routes in parts of eastern Oklahoma were nearly impassable. The Will Rogers Turnpike, I-44 in northeast Oklahoma, also was closed, and the National Guard was rescuing people trapped in their cars, the department said. Tow trucks were running as much three hours behind in some parts of the state, it said. In Tulsa, even police cars and ambulances got stuck in the snow. The snowfall also collapsed part of a roof at the Hard Rock Casino Tulsa, according to Amanda Clinton, a spokeswoman for the Cherokee Nation, which owns the casino. No one was injured. Those who ventured out did so against the advice of government and emergency officials, who urged people to stay off the roads and inside, and prepare for the worst. Up to 16 inches of snow are expected in parts of Michigan, with winds up to 40 mph causing significant drifts, according to CNN affiliate WILX in Lansing. Winds were gusting at 33 mph at Detroit City Airport Tuesday night, with the temperature at 17 degrees. Michigan's emergency management department has posted an advisory for residents to ""have essential supplies ready to stay safe at home, at work and in their vehicles."" As the storm approached, governments vowed they would be ready for what was being described as a storm of historic proportions. Missouri, Illinois, Oklahoma and Kansas declared states of emergency so they could bring extra resources to bear. Missouri mobilized 600 National Guard troops to help cope with the storm. Illinois put 500 troops on notice that they might be needed as the storm intensifies. Iowa also activated some guard members. Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe also declared a state of emergency and activated National Guard troops to help move supplies to the northwestern portion of the state, where power outages are expected as snow, ice and high winds move in. Warming centers set up by the Salvation Army were running and busy in Fayetteville and Bentonville, according to CNN affiliate KFTA. ""We are known for wild weather swings in Arkansas, but to have snow, ice and severe thunderstorms in the same day is rare,"" Beebe said. In Chicago, where snowfall of 15 inches or more happens but once every two decades, according to the National Weather Service, officials outfitted 120 garbage trucks with plows to supplement the city's usual fleet of 274 trucks, said Jose A. Santiago, executive director of the city's Office of Emergency Management. The White House press office issued a statement saying President Barack Obama had told the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be prepared to help state and local governments with widespread power outages and other issues arising from the storm. Thousands of flights were canceled Tuesday. Airports in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma, were effectively closed. United, Continental and American Airlines announced that flights were suspended after 5 p.m. (6 p.m. ET) out of Chicago O'Hare International Airport and that flights scheduled for Wednesday also have been suspended. Delta Air Lines said more than 1,350 flights, most of them to or from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, were canceled on Tuesday, and 800 Wednesday flights had also been canceled. JetBlue scrubbed 371 Tuesday flights and 794 total. US Airways canceled 687 flights. Plummeting temperatures were expected to filter in behind the system, dropping to below zero in the upper Plains states over the next few days. Parts of the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma also will experience some of the coldest air this season, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said.","NEW: Frigid precipitation stretches from Plains to Eastern Seaboard .

He said a hand grenade was found at the site after explosion. Security forces promptly defused it. The attack occurred at the funeral of the wife of a member of a pro-government militia group, said Muhammad Ejaz Khan, a senior city police official. A few hours after the blast, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said his group was behind the blast.

975,"(CNN) -- A tug boat lookout was on a cellphone call to his mother's house when the barge it was ferrying collided with an anchored tour boat in the Delaware River last summer, according to a report released Monday by the National Transportation Safety Board. Two tourists died and 26 other passengers were injured in the July 7 collision between the barge and the tour boat near Philadelphia. The safety board report is a factual finding in an ongoing investigation and does not offer a conclusion as to what caused the accident. The accident occurred shortly after the tour boat, the DUKW 34, had dropped anchor to deal with a mechanical problem that caused smoked to pour out of the engine. Around 2:37 p.m., a barge propelled by the tug boat, the Caribbean Sea, collided with the tour boat, causing it to sink in 55 feet of water. According to the report, the Caribbean Sea's master was off duty and below deck. The mate was on navigation watch. The report states that, according to telephone records, the mate made a call to his mother's house at 2:32 p.m. The call, according to the report, lasted until 2:38, one minute after the accident occurred. The report also states that that between noon and the accident, when the mate was on navigation watch, he made 13 phone calls and answered six. In radio recordings released by the U.S. Coast Guard last year, an unidentified voice is heard yelling early in the incident, ""Hey ferry, ferry, ferry! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"" DUKW 34 crew members told investigators that they made radio calls to the tug boat Caribbean Sea that were not answered prior to the collision, the National Transportation Safety Board has said.","NTSB releases preliminary report on collision between Philadelphia tour boat and barge .

977,"Sakura, Japan (CNN) -- Residents of northern Japan streamed south from their earthquake-stricken hometowns Saturday, crowding stores in search of vital supplies as rescue teams worked north toward the historic quake's epicenter. Roads and buildings showed cracks as far away as 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Sendai, the closest city to the epicenter. One man told CNN the scene in towns hit by the quake and the resulting tsunami was ""unimaginable."" Shoppers were polite but tense as they sought food, water and gasoline from stores, where shelves were quickly emptied and pumps soon ran dry. A slow, steady line of cars trickled south from the disaster zone as people either left the area or shuttled to the stores, many of which were without power and had broken glass scattered down the aisles. Japan's major highways, large sections of which are elevated, have been closed since the magnitude 8.9-quake struck off the northeastern coast Friday afternoon. Automobile traffic crawled on smaller, two-lane roads as power outages left the sleek, electric-powered ""bullet trains"" -- shining examples of Japan's advanced technology, usually capable of speeds nearing 200 mph -- sitting motionless on their tracks. Closer to the heart of the disaster, collapsed phone lines and towers left communications spotty. Roads and airfields were washed out by the tsunami; rescue workers headed to the stricken region had to rely on helicopters. Video from Sendai showed people trapped in the second floors of homes, waving sheets of white cloth in hopes of drawing rescue workers. Residents who have been able to call out reported gas and water were unavailable for a radius well beyond the city of about 1 million. In Minamisoma, a city about 90 kilometers (56 miles) south of Sendai, all that was left of many structures were their foundations. Only concrete and steel buildings appeared to have withstood the wash. No people were visible in the streets of the town, whose population on Friday had been 70,000. The quake and resulting tsunami left behind hundreds dead by early Saturday, and that number was expected to climb sharply. Tokyo, about 370 kilometers (230 miles) from the epicenter, was spared major damage from the quake. But power outages and highway closures paralyzed the city as its transit network was shut down. Commuters who usually pack the city's subways and suburban trains in the city of 13 million tried to flag down taxis, hitch rides or walk home. The roads leading out of Tokyo were clogged by traffic jams that trapped some drivers for up to six hours. CNN's Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","Stocks of food, water and gasoline are running thin in the quake zone .

978,"(Fast Company) -- An earthquake with a magnitude of 8.9 hit Japan today, resulting in tsunami warnings for 20 countries, as well as California and Hawaii. Crisis mappers wasted no time responding: In under 2.5 hours Google launched its person finder application, which was also used when New Zealand's 6.3 quake struck last month, and a local developer in Tokyo, Shu Sigashi, a member of the OpenStreetMap Foundation in Japan, quickly put up a localized Ushahidi crisis platform. Crisis mapping's reach only goes as far as it is utilized, so the key now is getting the word out that online tools are available to help report the missing. Google's person finder app is already rapidly increasing in usage. Within a couple hours 2,000 reports had been logged. If you type in the name, ""Yoshi,"" in Google's app, results come up that indicate whether people with that name have been reported as alive or missing. Hawaii's Pacific Disaster Center has updated tsunami warnings and an interactive map with information on the risks present on each island. The UN satellite monitoring group that teamed up with Google and George Clooney in Sudan could also be activated at the request of the Japanese government at any moment. ""We're on standby basically,"" UNOSAT's Lars Bromley tells Fast Company. ""The Japanese have a very good disaster satellite monitoring program run out of their space agency (JAXA).

979,"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- It was a day and an event like so many others -- until it wasn't. Six people were killed and 12 others wounded, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, when a gunman opened fire in front of a Safeway supermarket in Tucson, Arizona, authorities said. The congresswoman had been hosting a meeting with constituents Saturday morning when the attack began. Dr. Steven Rayle told CNN's Wolf Blitzer he was about 10 feet away from Giffords when the gunman shot the congresswoman. ""He continued to fire, sort of rapidly, really at point-blank range. And the way things were set up, people really had no route to escape. They were sort of hemmed in by the architecture and the things around there,"" he said. After a moment of hesitation, Rayle said he ducked behind a concrete post, then laid on the ground so as not to be a target. Rayle said the suspect ""had a sort of determined look on his face"" as he opened fire. ""He was not sort of going around and picking out people and firing at them ... He was just firing his gun indiscriminately,"" he said. The 22-year-old suspect, who law enforcement sources identified as Jared Lee Loughner, was trying to reload when he was tackled to the ground, another witness said. The gun, which another bystander had wrestled from the gunman, was empty and cocked open. The shooter had another magazine at the ready, Joe Zamudio told CNN. ""He was ready for war. He was not playing around,"" Zamudio said. ""He was going to keep shooting. It was not over. He had just ran out of bullets."" Zamudio said he was one of the bystanders who pinned the gunman to the ground until police showed up. Jason Pekau, who works at a nearby store, said he heard the gunshots from 50 yards away. ""It sounded like tons of pots and pans falling down on the ground right next to my ear it was so loud,"" he said. He described a chaotic scene in the parking lot immediately after the attack. ""I just saw people running, screaming towards where the shooting happened. Everyone screaming that it was Gabrielle Giffords,"" he said. Witnesses told him she was shot ""point-blank in the head,"" Farley said. ""I did see them take her away on a stretcher,"" Pekau said about the congresswoman. ""She was moving, from what I saw with my own eyes."" Giffords may owe her survival to a quick-thinking intern, an Arizona state legislator told CNN. Arizona state Rep. Steve Farley said Daniel Hernandez, his former campaign manager -- and a trained nurse -- was interning for Giffords and staffing Saturday's meet-and-greet event. ""He said that when he was in the back ... he heard shots in the front. He rushed to see what had happened. Gabby was on the floor,"" Farley said. ""He was able to use his nurse training and snapped right into it and was able to apply pressure to the wound and keep her active and alert. He rode with her in the ambulance to the hospital."" Video from the scene showed one of Giffords' banners still hanging in the storefront. Yellow tape was draped around the parking lot as police began their investigation. Giffords won her third term in a closely contested race against a Tea Party-sponsored candidate and was one of three Democratic legislators who reported vandalism at their offices following the March vote on health care reform. President Barack Obama spoke from Washington soon after the attack. He called it a national tragedy and underlined how simply the day began -- like any other. ""It's not surprising that today, Gabby was doing what she was always does -- listening to the hopes and concerns of her neighbors,"" said Obama, referring to the congresswoman by her nickname. ""That is the essence of what our democracy is all about.""","NEW: ""He was ready for war. He was not playing around,"" one witness says .

980,"(CNN) -- Two stunt pilots survived a plane crash caused by engine trouble at an air show in Texas on Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Stunned onlookers at the Air Fiesta show watched as the plane plummeted, leaving a white trail behind as it dove toward a wooded area near an airport in Brownsville, Texas. The stunt team onboard -- married couple Kyle and Amanda Franklin -- ""suffered severe burns following the crash,"" according to a statement on the air show's website. They were in the middle of a wing-walking act when the engine problems began, FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said. ""The female wing-walker was able to get back into the airplane, but the plane crashed into a thicket near the runway,"" Lunsford said. On their website, the couple describes their act: ""Together Kyle and Amanda have created a swaggering, wing-walking pirate show that would make Captain Jack Sparrow gulp. This flying circus of ""Pirated Skies"" will have audiences yelling 'Aaargh' as Amanda wing walks, playing the part of 'Scandalous Scarlett' and sword fights with Kyle, the menacing 'Captain Kyro.'"" The statement on the air show's website, which includes a painting of the couple sword-fighting in a plane with a skull and crossbones, said the two-day event would continue Sunday ""and will be dedicated to Kyle and Amanda."" According to their website, both pilots' fathers were also stunt pilots who died when their planes collided in a mid-air collision at an air show in 2005. ""Their love rose from the ashes of the plane wreckage and their abilities as an air show act are a testament to the ongoing legacy of a family fated to continue dancing on wings of airplanes,"" the site says.

981,"(CNN) -- A magnitude-4.4 earthquake rattled residents of southern California early Tuesday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, authorities said. However, police and fire officials said they had received calls from residents awakened by the quake. Its epicenter was 11 miles east-southeast of the Los Angeles Civic Center, the USGS reported. It struck at 4:04 a.m. ""First it was a small one and then a big one,"" said Chris Curiel, who was working at the Vallejo Mini Market in Whittier, a town near the epicenter. ""It felt like the floor was sinking."" He said merchandise on the shelves began shaking, but there was no damage. Because his market is a gas station, earthquakes are a bit more worrisome, he said. Curiel said he knew immediately an earthquake was happening, and he has felt one before. Ravi Singh, night shift supervisor at a 7-Eleven in Pico Rivera -- the town a mile east-northeast of the epicenter -- told CNN he was making coffee when the store's windows started rattling. There was no damage, he said. ""Everything is fine."" iReporter says ""it sounded like there were kids dancing upstairs"" Although the temblor was centered 11 miles below the Earth's surface, according to USGS, the movement was enough to awaken some southern Californians. ""It felt like two quick jolts,"" said CNN's Rosalina Nieves. ""I felt some shaking, and I wasn't sure if it was just my upstairs neighbor ... but then you definitely felt two quick jolts."" She said the movement lasted for a couple of seconds. While earthquakes are common in southern California, Nieves, a native of Los Angeles, said recent earthquakes in Chile and Haiti have caused concern. ""The first thing that jumps into your mind is, 'Is this the big one?'"" she said. CNN's Maria White contributed to this report.","Magnitude 4.4 earthquake strikes at 4:04 a.m.

982,"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Italy's coast guard says at least 1,623 migrants have landed on the tiny island of Lampedusa over a 24-hour period. According to a coast guard statement released Tuesday, at least seven boats believed to have taken off from Tunisia landed on the Italian island with more than 400 passengers. The rest of the people were rescued at sea by Italian maritime patrols. Sailors at the Tunisian fishing port of Zarzis said they have seen a spike in the number of boats full of migrants departing on the dangerous 16- to 24-hour journey to Lampedusa, about 100 kilometers (62 miles, or 54 nautical miles) away. ""Yesterday, seven boats left here for Lampedusa,"" Faisal Jebnoun said Monday as he pulled seaweed and other debris from his net after a long day fishing for squid. ""The youth are crazy,"" Jebnoun added.  ""They all think they'll find a better life in Italy, and they don't even speak Italian!"" Italy has seen a surge in migrants from Tunisia since the North African country experienced a revolution in January that threw longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from power. Lampedusa is often a favored target since it is one of the southernmost European points in the Mediterranean Sea. At one point, said Souei Abdesslem, president of the Blue-fish Union in Zarzis, so many young Tunisians were anxious to smuggle themselves to Europe that fishermen began sleeping in their boats to prevent them from being stolen for the hazardous passage across the Mediterranean. The Italian coast guard reported that it had rescued five passengers Sunday night who said their boat sank, with 35 other passengers still missing. Dozens of passengers from a Tunisian boat are believed to have died in January after it collided with a Tunisian coast guard vessel on a similar journey. Coast guard spokesman Cosimo Nicastro said he expects that the recent surge of migrants will decrease because of forecasts of stormy weather in the days ahead.","At least 1,623 landed on the island over a 24-hour period .

983,"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- Trapped beneath his collapsed home in Port-au-Prince, rescuers had to amputate Georges Exantus' right leg in order to free him. He was one of the survivors from Haiti's January 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people. Exantus, 29, was quickly rushed to a hospital in neighboring Dominican Republic, where he spent over two months recovering. Now, he is waiting at a bus stop in Santo Domingo, heading back to Haiti. Back to uncertainty. Back to zero. ""Staying in the Dominican Republic is not an option,"" he said. That's because the Dominican Republic's government is forcing Haitian refugees to return home after they have received medical treatment there. But it is unclear where Exantus and others like him will go. It could take more than a decade to rebuild Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, which was devastated by the 7.0 magnitude temblor.  Read more about Haiti's recovery efforts . ""We share one island, but it is probably easier to find refuge for Haitians in France than in the Dominican Republic"", said Hode Hyppolite, a family friend who accompanied Exantus back to Port-au-Prince. Haiti and Dominican Republic are united by geography, sharing the island of Hispaniola, both former sugar colonies under France and Spain respectively. However, Haitians and Dominicans have had tense relations dating back as far as the mid-19th century, when Haiti occupied Dominican Republic for more than 20 years. Following this year's earthquake, Dominican Republic offered its hospitals and medical services to Haitians.  That solidarity gave hope to some Haitians inside the Dominican Republic that their status may change. ""This is a double standard policy: Haitian immigrants are needed in the Dominican Republic but not wanted,"" said Bridget Wooding, who analyzes migration on Hispaniola. Dominican Republic has always relied heavily on Haitian workers for its agriculture and construction industries. A flood of Haitian workers poured into the country after the overthrow of Haitian dictator Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier in 1986. Research conducted before the January 12 quake showed that Haitians made up nearly 80 percent of Dominican Republic's agricultural labor force, according to the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences in Santo Domingo and the International Organization for Migration. That is a reverse of the government's required ratio of 80 percent native workers to 20 percent foreign workers. While there are no official government statistics, analysts estimate that up to one million unauthorized Haitian workers live in Dominican Republic. Although the Dominican Republic's government says it has beefed up its border security, experts say the border remains porous. ""Daily there are more than 100 trips carried out from the different places [along the border] loading Haitian immigrants,"" analyst Jose Luis Fernandez said. Fernandez analyzes refugee and immigration patterns for the Jesuit Refugee Services in Dajabon, Dominican Republic, on the border with Haiti.  There are no exact figures, but based on his observations, Fernandez believes the number of illegal Haitian workers has quadrupled since the January 12 quake. Marie Noel, a Haitian who gives massages to tourists at the Boca Chica beach near Santo Domingo, knows how easy it is to cross. ""You pay 5,000 Pesos [around $140] to an agent and if you have problems at the border you pay a little extra,"" she explained. Many Haitians usually arrive in the Dominican Republic to work on the sugar plantations for about $2 a day. Like most illegal immigrants with no papers, they face discrimination and live in constant fear of deportation. Amy Serrano has documented the labor conditions of Haitians and their children in Dominican sugar plants in her 2007 film, ""The Sugar Babies."" ""People who are promised a better life end up on sugar plantations with no identification and no rights,"" she said. Further complicating the immigration issue, Dominican Republic's new constitution took effect just two weeks after the January earthquake. It restricts citizenship for the children of Haitian immigrants. The relationship between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is a ""work in progress,"" according to José Achécar, who monitors poverty data for the government in Santo Domingo. ""There is a lot of xenophobia against Haitians,"" he said. ""We are like oil and water, we don't mix. But we may get closer through this catastrophe. We need each other. We share one island."" Those sentiments mean little for Georges Exantus, who had to be lifted onto the bus that took him back to Haiti. ""I want to return to Haiti, it is my home,"" he said. ""But there is nothing for me now.""","Haitians still illegally entering Dominican Republic, months after deadly quake .

985,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Charlie Sheen was ""very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain"" last Thursday morning, according to a 911 call from a doctor who had just talked to the actor. ""Kind of weird, the phone call I received,"" Dr. Paul Nassif told the Los Angeles Fire Department dispatcher in the recorded call, which was released by the fire department Wednesday. Porn actress Kacey Jordan has told media outlets that a two-day party preceded Sheen's collapse. Paramedics went to Sheen's Los Angeles home and then took him by ambulance to a hospital, where he spent several hours. Sheen's representative later blamed a hernia for Sheen's pain and ambulance ride to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He did not respond to a CNN request for comment on the 911 call Wednesday. Sheen's manager has said the actor is undergoing rehab at home, not in a residential facility. His hit CBS sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" has suspended production, with the network ordering additional episodes of ""Rules of Engagement"" to fill the gap in their Monday night schedule. ""I have a lot of work to do to be able to return the support I have received from so many people,"" Sheen said in a statement . released Wednesday. It did not directly address the incident. ""Like Errol Flynn, who had to put down his sword on occasion, I just want to say, 'thank you,'"" Sheen said. Dr. Paul Nassif, in an interview Tuesday by HLN's ""Showbiz Tonight,"" said he couldn't tell if Sheen, who is his friend, was drunk. What he told the emergency dispatcher last week was different. ""I got him on the phone and he was very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain,"" Nassif said on the 911 call. He told the dispatcher that Sheen was saying, ""Don't call 911."" Nassif is a facial plastic surgeon and is not Sheen's medical doctor, Nassif told HLN. Sheen and now ex-wife Brooke Mueller were married in Nassif's Beverly Hills home, Nassif said. Nassif's wife, Adrienne Maloof-Nassif, appears on ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."" ""They wanted to get married, and a mutual friend introduced all of us, and they said, 'Let's get married, can we get married at your house?' and that's how we met and soon after that we became very good friends,"" Nassif said. Nassif drove Sheen home from the hospital, but he declined to provide details of their conversation. ""There were things he said I don't feel comfortable"" disclosing, Nassif said. At another point in the interview, Nassif added: ""Obviously we all want Charlie to keep his sobriety. No one can push him into it.""","NEW: Sheen says he has ""a lot of work to do to be able to return the support""

986,"(CNN) -- A second day of a strike against Pakistan's flagship carrier, Pakistan International Airlines, ended Wednesday with police charging protesters and angry passengers at Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, said Pervez George, an official with Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority. George said a number of people were beaten as police attempted to clear the terminal and restore order. The strike was called on Tuesday after month-long negotiations between the airline and unions representing the airline's pilots and staff ended in failure. PIA grounded close to 60 international and domestic flights leaving thousands of frustrated passengers at Jinnah airport and Benazir Bhutto International Airport in Islamabad. The Islamabad airport was closed to passengers and PIA staff with police guarding all entrances and exits. PIA staff called the strike demanding management reinstate five pilots who were fired, that Managing Director Pia Aijaz Haroon resign, and that a proposed code share agreement with Turkish Airlines be dropped. Speaking to CNN, Suhail Baluch, president of the Pakistan Airlines Pilots Association and head of a joint action committee representing all airline employees, said ""the proposed code share agreement, which still needs to be approved by the government and regulators, would make PIA into a regional airline as opposed to international and get rid of lucrative international routes."" Furthermore, the code share agreement would cut down the number of staff because flights would use Istanbul or Ankara as their hub and use Turkish Airlines staff to fly passengers to international destinations currently offered by PIA, he said. Haroon was appointed managing director of Pakistan International Airlines two years ago. Since then, he has been criticized over alleged corruption scandals and for the airline incurring heavy debt. According to Baluch, ""This is another example of Haroon's corruption, we have the crew and capabilities and we have been flying for the last 50 years. I don't know what is the reason behind the code share."" The joint action committee from the union flew to Islamabad Wednesday for discussions with Federal Minister Khurshid Shah, who oversees the airline. However, no agreement was reached. Shah agreed to two of the union's demands but declined to consider removing Haroon as managing director of PIA, the union said. Strikers have vowed to continue striking until they reach a conclusion and the managing director is removed. ""We have declared today that until they kick out Haroon the strike will continue,"" said Baluch. Airline spokesman Mashdood Tajwar refused to comment on the situation.","Second day of strike ends with police charging protesters, passengers, aviation official says .

987,"(CNN) -- Two people were shot dead and two sheriff's deputies were wounded late Sunday afternoon outside a Walmart store in western Washington state, a Kitsap County Sheriff's spokesman said. Three sheriff's deputies responded to the scene around 3:45 p.m. Sunday after getting a call about a suspicious person ""from a bystander who had concerns about a person inside the store,"" Deputy Scott Wilson said. The deputies approached one man outside the store's south entrance, but -- rather than responding verbally -- he ran from the scene, turned around to face the deputies and began shooting. ""(The deputies) called to him and said, 'Hey, we need to talk to you,'"" said Wilson. ""He turned around and shot at them, and they returned fire."" The male shooter was shot and later pronounced dead in the Walmart parking lot. As of Sunday night, authorities had not released his name, age or other details about him. A young female -- thought to be a teenager, said Wilson -- also was shot, with emergency personnel then transporting her to Tacoma General Hospital. She eventually died from her wounds. Wilson said authorities don't know if the female victim knew the male shooting suspect or if she was an innocent bystander. The two deputies, both men with between five and 10 years of experience in the department, were sent to Tacoma General Hospital to be treated for what Wilson described as ""non-life-threatening"" injuries. The third deputy, a woman, wasn't hurt. Wilson described the situation as ""somewhat chaotic"" but ""stabilized."" ""There is no danger to the community at this point,"" he said. ""We think that all persons (who were) involved ... have been accounted for."" The Washington State Police were taking over as the lead investigative agency in the case, with the Kitsap County Sheriff's Department also requesting assistance from the FBI. The incident occurred near one of the retail giant's stores in Port Orchard, a town just west of Parkwood. Located on Sinclair Inlet, Port Orchard is about 30 miles north-northwest of Tacoma and across Puget Sound from Seattle. The store was locked down for about 20 minutes immediately after the shooting with about 100 people inside, Walmart customer Mike Lambert told CNN affiliate KIRO, with police tape used to cordon off the parking lot.

988,"(CNN) -- A quick look at Japan's nuclear industry and the problems faced at three plants since Friday's massive earthquake off northern Honshu, as compiled by the CNN Wire: . NATIONWIDE . Japan's electric power companies run 54 nuclear reactors, with two under construction, at 17 power plants, according to figures from the International Atomic Energy, the U.N. nuclear watchdog. They produced more than 280,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2010 -- about 30 percent of Japan's total electricity generation. Most Japanese plants -- including the three facing emergencies since the earthquake -- use boiling-water reactors, in which water circulated through the reactor is converted to steam and used to drive a generator. Most U.S. reactors and about 40 percent of Japan's are pressurized-water reactors, in which reactor coolant is kept separate from the steam used to drive generators. Both types are far different than the Soviet design involved in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, a reactor model now considered unsafe by the international nuclear industry. In addition, the Chernobyl plant lacked the kind of reinforced steel-and-concrete containment structure that U.S. and Japanese regulators require. Tokyo Electric Power Company is the largest of the nine utilities that operate Japan's nuclear plants and runs the two plants affected by Friday's quake. In 2002, its president, vice president and chairman resigned after a scandal in which TEPCO was accused of falsifying safety repair records in 29 cases. The company instituted reforms in September 2002 in an attempt to restore public confidence. FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI . The plant with the worst reported problems is TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi, about 65 km (40 miles) south of Sendai. Three of the plant's six reactors had already been shut down for inspection at the time of the quake, but two of the three that were in service at the time have been damaged, the utility said. An explosion caused by hydrogen buildup Saturday blew the roof off the No. 1 reactor's containment structure and injured four workers, but the reactor was not reported to have sustained damage. Workers have been pouring a mixture of seawater and boron into the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors in what experts have called a last-ditch attempt to prevent a meltdown -- a catastrophic failure of the reactor core, with a potential for widespread radiation release. Japanese nuclear regulators have said there is a ""possibility"" that at least a partial meltdown already has occurred in the reactors. The government has evacuated more than 200,000 residents from homes within a 20-km (12.5-mile) radius of the plant and tested 160 people for radiation exposure, authorities said Sunday. The six units at Fukushima Daiichi went into service between 1970 and 1979. FUKUSHIMA DAINI . Japanese authorities have detected cooling-system problems at TEPCO's Fukushima Daini plant, but have not expressed any concerns about possible meltdowns there. Nevertheless, those living within a 10-km radius of Fukushima Daini were ordered to evacuate as a precaution. TEPCO reported that cooling systems the three operational units at Fukushima Daini failed after the quake, but the IAEA, citing Japanese authorities, reported that all three had power Sunday afternoon. TEPCO reported one fatality at the plant. A crane operator who had been trapped at an operating console in the plant's exhaust stack was pronounced dead Saturday, the company reported. Fukushima Daini is about 80 km south of Sendai. The plant's four reactors went online between 1981 and 1987. ONAGAWA . Japanese officials declared an emergency Sunday at the Onagawa nuclear plant after finding radiation levels above allowed levels in the surrounding area. However, radiation levels had dropped to normal levels by early Monday, and the ""current assumption"" of Japanese authorities is that the increased radiation levels may have been caused by material released from Fukushima Daiichi, according to the IAEA. The plant reported smoke in a turbine house after Friday's earthquake, but Japan has told the IAEA that the three reactors at Onagawa are under control. Onagawa is about 70 km north of Sendai. It is owned by the Tohoku Electric Company, and its three reactors entered service between 1983 and 2001.

The British national, 37, was arrested on arrival, police in the county of Essex said. The flight was bound for London's Heathrow Airport from Abu Dhabi, but was diverted to nearby Stansted Airport. The plane landed safely and the airports are operating normally, officials said. There were no injuries.

990,"Minamisanriku, Japan (CNN) -- As some in Japan officially kicked off their first work week Monday since its epic earthquake and tsunami, others -- especially in the country's northeast -- grieved the loss of loved ones, kept fleeting hopes that missing could be found alive and tried to come to grips with a disaster that literally tore some communities apart. The nation's Kyodo News Agency, citing Prime Minister Naoto Kan, reported more than 15,000 people have been rescued in the days since Friday's 8.9-magnitude tremor. But, while 1,598 people were officially dead Monday according to the National Police Agency Emergency Disaster Headquarters, the fear was that the final death toll could be exponentially higher. That official figure, for instance, does not include 200 to 300 bodies in Sendai that have yet to be recovered, Kyodo reports. Nor does it include half the population of Minamisanriku -- some 9,500 people -- who may be unaccounted for. In that northeastern Japanese town, a family photo album lay on the sodden ground, showing a beaming man holding a newborn baby -- happiness out of place amid the devastation and carnage left by a tsunami that occurred just after a massive earthquake. Only a handful of buildings were left standing, with the rest a mangled mess of rubble. A boat sat on the edge of town, carried more than two miles inland by the tsunami. When the tsunami warning sounded Friday, ""Most people ran away,"" said Choushin Takahashi, who was working in a local government office near the water. ""Some had to leave the elderly or disabled behind on the second floor. I think a lot of those left behind probably died."" As the wave hit, he said he felt as if it was happening in a dream. ""I saw the bottom of the sea when the tidal wave withdrew and houses and people were being washed out,"" another resident said. ""I couldn't watch anymore."" A dramatic rescue took place off Japan's coast Sunday, when a Japanese destroyer rescued a 60-year-old man at sea, some 15 kilometers (9 miles) off Fukushima prefecture, according to Kyodo News Agency. The man, identified as Hiromitsu Shinkawa of Minamisoma, was swept away with his house, Kyodo said. He was spotted floating in the sea, waving a self-made red flag while standing on a piece of his house's roof. Shinkawa was conscious and in good condition, Kyodo said, citing Defense Ministry officials. He was quoted as telling rescuers he had left his home because of the quake, but returned home to grab some belongings with his wife when the tsunami hit. ""I was saved by holding onto the roof,"" he said, ""but my wife was swept away."" When a member of Japan's Maritime Self Defense Force handed him something to drink on the rescue boat, Shinkawa drank it and burst into tears, Kyodo reported. ""No helicopters or boats that came nearby noticed me,"" he said. ""... I thought today was the last day of my life."" In Minamisanriku, search and rescue efforts were frequently disturbed by tsunami alerts prompted by ongoing aftershocks. When the alarm sounded, police abandoned their cars, rescue workers blew whistles and people rushed to high ground. ""It's your life!"" shouted one man. ""Run!"" It was a false alarm, but such warnings are taken seriously in the wake of the disaster. In Sendai, south of Minamisanriku, Hiroki Otomo said his mother and uncle remain missing. They were at the family's home when the tsunami struck. ""Frightening beyond belief,"" Otomo said. ""I have no words."" Many areas of the town are simply gone -- mud and splintered wood littering an area where a row of homes used to stand; a vehicle upside-down among tree branches. A school, which had 450 people inside when the tsunami hit, stood with its doors blown open and a jumble of furniture -- plus a truck -- in its hallways. Some teachers and students were able to escape the building, but officials said others did not. Sendai residents said the water reached the treetops as it swept into the town. Cars were tossed like toys, windows blasted out and homes crushed or swept away completely. ""As I was trying to evacuate, the tsunami was already in front of me,"" another young man said. ""I tried to drive, but I ended up running instead."" Some four-wheel-drive vehicles were seen on Sendai roads. Military choppers hovered overhead. Among those yet to be rescued Sunday were those trapped in a hospital, officials said. ""I've been watching TV, but it looks much worse when I actually see it in person,"" said a third young man. ""I grew up in the house that was not close to the ocean. I didn't think it would be this bad, but I'm from the west side and I guess some people could not imagine the horror of the tsunami and couldn't evacuate in time."" Some residents of coastal Sendai returned to their homes Sunday, salvaging what they could. Others stood in long lines for limited fuel and, especially, for food and water. The line at one food and water distribution center was several blocks long. Melissa Heng said she has many colleagues who are unable to reach friends and family living elsewhere in Miyagi prefecture, as phone service has been spotty. That, she said, is ""adding to the emotional toll."" But ""for a city that's seen so much tragedy in the last few days, the people seem very calm,"" she said. Many families are focusing on the cleanup process, she said, and there is a sense that ""we're all in this together.""

991,"(CNN)  -- The MotoGP race due to be held in Japan next month has been postponed until later in the year in the aftermath of Friday's earthquake and tsunami. The 9.0-magnitude quake caused cracks on the track and damaged spectator seats at the circuit in Motegi, to the north of Tokyo. In a statement on their official website, the sport's governing body confirmed that the motorbike world championship race would now take place in October. It is the latest in a list of sporting fixtures to be affected by the recent disaster in the Asian country, where there are also fears of a radiation leak from several explosions at a nuclear plant. Japan's sporting schedule hit in aftermath of quake disaster . On Monday it was confirmed that the World Skating Championships, scheduled to take place in Tokyo this month, had been postponed until further notice. The Japanese Football Association, meanwhile, said that no J-League football matches would take place in March, and added that the national team's upcoming friendly games could also be abandoned. Japan is continuing to experience aftershocks from the quake which has already claimed the lives of thousands of people and left many more homeless. The 18-race MotoGP season will now begin in Losail, Qatar on March 20. It is the second year in a row that the Japanese round has had to be rescheduled. The 2010 race was also postponed from April to October following the volcanic ash crisis in Iceland that prevented competitors and spectators from flying to the Far East. The opening race in the 2011 Formula One championship has already had to be cancelled this year. The season-opener in Bahrain was called-off amid ongoing political unrest and protests in the country, and the first grand prix will now take place in Melbourne on March 26.","After Friday's earthquake and tsunami the MotoGP race in Japan is postponed .

992,"(CNN) -- Japanese stocks closed down 10.55 percent, recovering from deeper losses earlier in the session, as the nation grappled with a crisis at an earthquake-damaged nuclear power plant and the aftermath of last week's earthquake and tsunami. It was the third steepest percentage fall in the Nikkei's history. At one point, the Nikkei plunged more than 1,390 points, or more than 14 percent, nearing the worst-ever plunge of 14.90 percent on October 20, 1987, after the U.S. stock market crash on Black Monday. The close at 8,605.15, combined with the 6.2 percent drop on Monday, the first full trading day after the quake, marked a nearly 17 percent drop in two days. A few hours earlier, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the risk of further releases of radioactive material from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant remained ""very high."" The Tokyo market had opened shortly after the owner of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in northeastern Japan reported an ""explosive impact"" at the plant's No. 2 reactor, a day after a hydrogen explosion rocked another reactor. The plant was among the many structures damaged or destroyed by the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The death toll following the quake has risen to 2,475, authorities said, with at least 3,118 people missing. The Kyodo News Agency said that doesn't take into account reports of thousands of bodies in one northeastern prefecture. More than 450,000 people are reported homeless. Other Asian markets were also down markedly, a day after modest gains in the face of the Japanese sell-off. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was off 3 percent in afternoon trading. U.S. markets were set for a lower open. S&P and Dow futures were lower by 0.6 percent, while Nasdaq futures were down 0.8 percent. Check world markets . World markets finished generally lower Monday as investors assessed the impact of the Japanese disaster on the global economy. In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average slid 51 points, or 0.4 percent.

993,"(CNN) -- The Japanese Football Association (JFA) has announced that its national football team will play a charity match to help victims of the recent earthquake in the Asian country. Japan was hit by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami last week which has already claimed the lives of 6,500 people, with 10,354 reported missing. The match is due to take place at Osaka's Nagai Stadium on March 29, with the Samurai Blue's opposition to be a team made up of players from the domestic J-League. The recently-crowned Asian Cup champions have been forced to cancel friendly matches against Montenegro and New Zealand due to the disaster. Can sport help Japan recover from disaster? JFA president Junji Ogura said the association had tried to arrange a charity fixture with New Zealand, which was also recently hit by an earthquake. ""We have had strong requests from Japan coach (Alberto) Zaccheroni and our national team players that they want to do something to support and encourage the victims,"" Ogura told the JFA website. ""But because this is still a difficult moment, we thought we should hold a charity match to support those who have suffered in the quake-hit areas and assist in their recovery as soon as possible. ""I received a phone call from the president of the New Zealand Football Association and could understand that it was a tough decision they had to make following lengthy discussions. ""Although we cannot play New Zealand, we wanted to do something to encourage the victims. As we want to do it with the power of everyone, we would like to ask for your assistance."" Japan's captain Makoto Hasebe, a midfielder for German club Wolfsburg, expressed his and the team's desire to repay the nation for their support in last year's World Cup. ""Japan performed well in last year's World Cup by establishing great unity within the squad,"" the 27-year-old said. ""We were able to do this through the support we received from people across the country. Now our country is facing a big crisis and this is the moment we should do something in return for the people's support for us then. ""The only thing we can do is play football. It may not be much, but that's how we would like to encourage the Japanese people. I am heading back home to Japan to take part in this charity match for them."" Italian coach Zaccheroni took charge in 2010 and guided the team to Asian Cup success in Qatar in January. The former AC Milan and Juventus boss believes the people of Japan will recover from recent events. ""Since I assumed the position of Japan coach, I have seen very closely the Japanese people's beauty and ability to unite, to be disciplined and to respect others.

996,"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova's parents fled their home to escape the fallout from the Chernobyl explosion before she was born. Fast-forward 25 years, and Japan's battle to prevent a possible nuclear meltdown following last week's earthquake and subsequent tsunami has brought into focus the Russian tennis star's work to raise awareness about that earlier disaster. The 23-year-old was born in Siberia a year after the Chernobyl catastrophe, considered the worst nuclear accident in history, as her parents left Belarus to avoid any possible exposure to the spreading radiation. In 2007, the year after she won her second grand slam title at the U.S. Open, Sharapova became a United Nations Development Program goodwill ambassador, making a personal $100,000 donation to its causes in affected areas. 'Heroes' battle to keep nuclear plant under control . This January, she contributed another $250,000 to expand initiatives helping children in the region have access to sporting activities. The problems Japan now faces have raised the specter of another such far-reaching disaster. ""In terms of what's going on over there, it's crazy and something that you can't even prepare for,"" Sharapova -- wearing a T-shirt marking the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl explosion -- told reporters in Indian Wells in the United States, where she is competing. ""It happens, and you see the coverage on it and the videos, and it's really incredible that something like that can even happen in the world. It opens your eyes, and obviously puts a lot of perspective in your life. ""It's a country where I have very great memories from. I started playing there when I was very young, and I always loved my experiences there. So to see it going on there, to its culture and the people, it's really sad."" Sharapova, who moved to the U.S. at the age of nine and is now based in Florida, said she wants to highlight the widespread, long-lasting effects that a nuclear accident can create. ""In the beginning my job was raising awareness to the world, basically getting the message across that even though something like that happened such a long time ago, it still causes many people (problems) on a daily basis,"" she said. ""Kids that were born and now are having kids, you also find that they have something in their body that's not allowing them to live a normal life from the pollution. ""I have never actually been around the area ... I wanted to get all the coverage and all the videos around it, because it's really unbelievable what you see. This big huge area -- it's completely deserted. No-one is around it. ""Everyone has completely fled. They took their passports and that's all. That was their only belonging that they really wanted.""","Tennis star Maria Sharapova reflects on potential nuclear meltdown in Japan .

997,"New York (CNN) -- At least 14 passengers died early Saturday after the driver of their tour bus lost control of the vehicle and struck a pole on Interstate 95 in the Bronx, New York police said. The accident occurred about 5:30 a.m. at the Bronx-Westchester County line, and forced the closing of I-95 in both directions until late Saturday, police said. Along with those who were killed, eight of the 31 passengers suffered severe injuries and were transported to area hospitals with the remaining survivors. The bus driver, Ophadel E. Williams, 40, of Brooklyn was also taken to an area hospital with ""non-life-threatening injuries,"" police said. Police have not determined the cause of the accident, which is now the subject of a criminal investigation, according to New York State Police Troop Commander, Major Michael Kopy. Williams said he was cut off by a truck driver which caused his bus to swerve into a guardrail, flip on its side and smash into a pole that cut through two-thirds of the vehicle. Kopy said police have recovered a tractor-trailer that was traveling through the area at the time and interviewed the vehicle's driver. However, Kopy said it has not been determined whether the vehicle was involved in the accident. Kopy also said that police had received reports that the bus was traveling ""at a high rate of speed."" Investigators are examining Williams' background and testing his blood for the presence of alcohol, Kopy said. Kopy also said a video camera had been recovered from the bus, but that investigators had not yet viewed it. At least seven passengers had to be extracted by removing seats and cutting a hole in the remaining roof. Most of the passengers were thrust to the forward third of the bus as it split open, suffering injuries mainly from the chest up, Fire Chief Edward Kilduff said. At least five people being treated at New York's St. Barnabas Hospital suffered skull and spinal fractures, internal bleeding and broken bones, Dr. Ernest Patti told reporters. ""Our -- and the entire city's -- prayers, thoughts and sympathies are with the victims, and their families and loved ones,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a written statement Saturday. ""Many of the victims are Chinese, and we have brought in translators to help assist the families."" The National Transportation Safety Board said it has deployed a 16-member team to investigate the crash, as the bus was traveling south on the New England Thruway near the border of Westchester and the Bronx -- one of New York City's five boroughs. It had departed from the Mohegan Sun Resort and Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut.

998,"(CNN) -- A floating body was found Saturday that authorities believe to be the man who kidnapped his ex-girlfriend's 4-year-old son and drove with him into a canal. A California water authority employee saw the body, believed to be that of Jose Esteban Rodriguez, at about 8:30 a.m. on Saturday. It was discovered in a part of the 117-mile Delta-Mendota Canal in the northern California city of Patterson, according to a press release from the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department. The employee alerted Stanislaus County Sheriff's detectives, who went to the scene along with members of the department's dive team and the West Stanislaus-Patterson Fire Department. Authorities determined the body was that of an adult Hispanic male with clothing and a physical make-up matching that of Rodriguez. Authorities will now employ scientific measures, such as DNA tests and dental records, and examine other evidence to definitively identify the body. The discovery comes 11 days after authorities found the body of young Juliani Cardenas, the boy who Rodriguez allegedly swiped from his grandmother's arms on January 18. Tabitha Cardenas, the boy's mother, who broke up with Rodriguez five months earlier, told CNN affiliate KCRA that she was ""relieved that all this is over."" She also expressed sympathy for Rodriguez's mother, now that his body has apparently been found. ""I feel her pain, because I know what it's like to lose a son,"" Cardenas said. ""She knows that I have always given her the utmost respect, through everything."" A day later, a farmer saw a car that appeared to be Rodriguez's 2003 silver Toyota Corrolla -- purportedly with a man and youngster inside -- careen into the canal. The Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department said that the body found Saturday was about 11 miles south of where that car was driven into the water. A homicide warrant had been issued for Rodriguez in connection with Juliani's death while authorities searched for him, Sheriff Adam Christianson said. Last month, authorities found the man's Toyota trapped in 50 feet of water and intertwined with two other vehicles, according to Christianson. The windows of the car were opened and it was badly damaged, but there were no bodies inside. Tabitha Cardenas had said Rodriguez either wanted to have her son for himself or wanted revenge for their breakup. She said she never thought Rodriguez, who is the father of her unborn child, would harm Juliani. Rodriguez ""wanted to be with my son,"" Cardenas said January 20. ""He wanted to be with my son so bad that he took it to the extreme.""","NEW: The kidnapped boy's mother says she's ""relieved that all this is over""

999,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese authorities vowed Friday to continue their aerial and ground-level dousing of water on a troubled nuclear reactor, with its owner saying that earlier attempts have been ""somewhat effective"" in addressing radiation concerns. Still, the Fukushima Daiichi complex of six nuclear reactors remained a danger. Radiation levels peaked Friday at 20 millisieverts per hour near in an annex building where workers were trying to reestablish electrical power, ""the highest registered (at that building) so far,"" an official with the Tokyo Electric Power Company told reporters. Radiation levels Thursday morning at the plant were nearly 3.8 millisieverts per hour -- more than a typical resident of a developed country receives in a year. But Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said 17 of 18 workers checked Thursday morning tested normal, and the one who received a higher dose of radiation required no medical treatment. Last Friday's earthquake and tsunami caused damage at four of the six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, located on the northern coast of the Japanese island of Honshu. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said that efforts would resume Friday afternoon to spray water from the ground and air in and around the plant's No. 3 reactor, the sole damaged unit that contains plutonium along with the uranium in its fuel rods. They have done so already in two rounds Thursday and another early Friday, according to Tokyo Electric. Based on the steam emitted after these water-spraying operations, Edano said that authorities believe there is still water in the spent fuel pool -- meaning fuel rods, which can give off radiation, likely aren't fully exposed -- though he said it was not clear how much liquid there was. Edano said Friday morning that authorities are also assessing whether to also spray in and around the plant's No. 1 reactor, though he added that the situation there was not as serious as in the No. 3 reactor. Concerns remained about the spent fuel pool at reactor No. 4, from which the IAEA said no water-temperature data has been received since Monday, and which a U.S. official said Wednesday appeared to contain no water. ""The current situation at units 1, 2 and 3, whose cores have suffered damage, appears to be relatively stable,"" said Graham Andrew, a top aide to IAEA Director-General Yukiya Amano. ""Unit 4, in particular, remains a major safety concern."" But a Tokyo Electric Power spokesman said Friday that a video of the No. 4 reactor's pool appeared to show it still contained water. Japanese military helicopters dumped tons of water on the No. 3 reactor housing, including its spent-fuel pool, at the plant until after midnight Thursday, TEPCO reported. Earlier, fire and police trucks turned their hoses on the No. 3 reactor housing for more than an hour, and TEPCO said the subsequent steam and lowered radioactivity levels indicated progress. Experts believe that steam rising from the pool, which contains at least partially exposed fuel rods, may be releasing radiation into the atmosphere. In Vienna, Austria, a senior official of the International Atomic Energy Agency told reporters the situation remains serious, but there had been ""no significant worsening"" Thursday. The state of the six nuclear reactors at Fukushima Daiichi has raised the specter of a multiple nuclear meltdown -- the nightmare scenario in which fuel rods cannot be cooled and the reactor's core melts. In the worst-case scenario, the fuel can spill out of the damaged containment unit and spread radioactivity and cancer-causing isotopes through the air and water. All six reactors have been shut down, but some appear in better shape than others. A spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, which oversees the running of the country's nuclear plants, said Friday morning that sea water was still being injected into the reactor pressure vessel of Unit 1. A hydrogen explosion damaged it on March 12. White smoke continued to emanate Friday from a hole in the Unit 2 building, said the spokesman, who was not identified by name. In a news release, the agency said ""an abnormal noise"" from the pressure suppression chamber had occurred on March 15 and the chamber's pressure dropped. Workers have been moved away from the unit, though sea water injection continues. A power source for the cooling system of Units 1 and 2 was expected to be connected Friday morning, a Tokyo Electric spokesman said. Unit 3 has been particularly worrisome. It was struck March 14 by an explosion -- described by the IAEA as caused by a hydrogen blast. Fog -- possibly steam -- began rising from the reactor building on Wednesday morning. Unit 3 too is being injected with sea water and water was being sprayed into it. The pressure of the suppression ""has been temporarily increasing since approximately 6:15 a.m. on March 17,"" the release said. Temperatures in the spent-fuel pools at Units 5 and 6 had been rising slowly since they lost power. But engineers got an emergency diesel generator connected to Units 5 and 6 to cool their spent-fuel pools, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said Friday. Water injection to the spent fuel pools was continuing. On Friday morning, Edano said temperatures in and around those two reactors have risen, though not enough to pose any immediate danger, according to a report by Japan's Kyodo News agency. Used nuclear fuel is stored in pools at each of the six reactors plus a shared pool and in a dry container storage, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. Sixty percent of the total is in the shared pool, 34% is stored in the six spent-fuel pools of the reactors, and the remaining 6% is stored in nine dry storage containers, it said. There were ""no safety concerns"" about the dry storage containers. The spent-fuel pools -- located at the top of the reactor buildings to make it easier to handle the fuel during refueling -- were typically filled with water 16 feet or more above the top of the fuel rods. ""The only way to rapidly drain down the pool is if there is structural damage to the walls of the floor,"" the release said, noting that the pools have no drains and are built of concrete and steel. They lose water slowly due to evaporation when the units lose power and the cooling systems stop working. But the threat is not immediate. ""Rapid evaporation of the water will not occur,"" the release says. If the water level drops below the fuel, ""oxidation of the zirconium cladding could occur,"" resulting in the formation of hydrogen, it says. But only fuel discarded within recent weeks would cause such a strong reaction, which would require temperatures of approximately 1,000 degrees Celsius, it adds. Zirconium melts at 1600 degrees C. ""The likelihood of cladding damage, as with hydrogen generation, decreases substantially with temperature and cooling time,"" it says. It called the prospect of a zirconium fire ""virtually impossible."" The TEPCO spokesman said the level of water in the main pool, which contained older fuel that had already cooled, was only 10 to 15 centimeters below normal. Still, he acknowledged, officials had not been able to measure the temperature there. And nuclear engineer Arnie Gundersen told CNN that the effort will likely need to be sustained ""for months, if not years."" ""What's pushing the firemen back is the radiation that's coming from the spent fuel pool,"" he said. If the spent fuel rods in that pool are uncovered, ""There's an awful lot of gamma rays flooding that site, forcing the workers to say further away."" Public health officials say the release of radiation from a meltdown can cause immediate and long-term health problems, including radiation poisoning and cancer. About 200,000 people living within a 20-kilometer (12-mile) radius of the plant have been evacuated; those living 20 to 30 kilometers from the site have been told to remain inside, and Japan has banned flights over the area. Rebecca Johnson, founder of the London-based Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy, which promotes international security, disarmament and arms control, told CNN that Japanese engineers were ""flying by the seat of their pants now ... Everything they try goes wrong. They're focusing on reactors, then spent fuel becomes damaged,"" Johnson said. ""They've just got to get water in there, keep the water pumping.""

1000,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Even as Washington and Tokyo disagreed on the extent of the threat a damaged nuclear power plant poses, President Barack Obama told the Japanese prime minister Thursday that the United States will help Japan rebuild following last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami. The two leaders had a 30-minute phone call at 10:30 a.m. Thursday (9:30 p.m. ET Wednesday). During the phone call with Prime Minister Naoto Kan, Obama voiced sympathy for Japan's plight. ""The president again conveyed his deep condolences at the tragic loss of life and the widespread suffering in northeastern Japan,"" a White House statement on the call said. ""The president emphasized that the U.S. is determined to do everything possible to support Japan in overcoming the effects of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck on March 11."" Kan also briefed the president on the status of Japanese efforts to contain the nuclear emergency at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in the country's northeast, the White House said. The developments came as the nations established significantly different radiation exposure warning zones. The U.S. military will not allow troops to get within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the damaged plant. The Japanese government has told people to evacuate to at least 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from the damaged reactors. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said Thursday it's ""understandable"" that the United States would make a ""more conservative decision"" on the warning zone as it tries to protect its own citizens. He suggests that is, in part, because the United States is ""not directly controlling"" the situation. Meanwhile, a Tokyo Electric Power company official said Thursday that -- based on information gathered from a helicopter that flew over the Fukushima facility on Wednesday -- authorities believe that there is water in a key fuel pool outside one of the plant's most troubled reactors. Hours earlier, Gregory Jaczko, the head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told Congress that spent fuel rods in Unit 4 of the plant had been exposed, resulting in the emission of ""extremely high"" levels of radiation. Having water in the fuel pool is important because it helps absorb the radiation. The Fukushima complex lost its power Friday, after a 9.0-magnitude earthquake followed by a tsunami pounded northeastern Japan.","NEW: Japan and United States issue different radiation warning zones .

1001,"(CNN) -- The Black Eyed Peas have joined a growing list of artists and celebrities calling attention to the disaster in Japan. The group shot their latest music video for the single ""Just Can't Get Enough"" in Tokyo a few days before the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and the resulting tsunami rocked the island nation. The video opens: ""This video was filmed in Japan one week before the earthquake. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the people of Japan. We love you."" The video closes with a link to the Red Cross. The video is scheduled to premier this week and the group will perform the song on ""American Idol"" Thursday night. The international aid agency appeared to be the charity of choice among celebs. Many are encouraging their fan bases to make donations via text message. ""Imagine... if we ALL texted REDCROSS to 90999 we'd have raised over 60million dollars for #JAPAN REFLIEF! BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE! BE!,"" said a post on singer Katy Perry's Twitter account this week. Likewise, rapper P. Diddy, talk show host Conan O'Brien and R&B singer Chris Brown implored their followers to help the victims of the disaster. Lady Gaga is taking a different approach, selling red-and-white ""We pray for Japan"" wristbands, which feature an image of the singer's monster paw gesture. ""Little Monsters, show your support for Japan with this 'We Pray For Japan' wristband!"" her website said, encouraging her fans to donate. ""All proceeds go directly to Japan relief efforts."" Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park has designed a T-shirt to benefit Music for Relief's Tsunami Relief in Japan. Donations of $10 can be made by texting ""MFR"" to 85944.

1003,"(CNN) -- The Japanese J-League will resume its fixture list on April 23, after all football was suspended following the earthquake and tsunami that hit the north-east of the country on March 11. Just one round of matches had been played prior to the disaster, with the missing five rounds now due to take place in July -- a month where no fixtures were originally scheduled because of Japan's national team commitments. However, it is still not certain whether the clubs that have been affected most be the disaster -- Kashima Antlers, Vegalta Sendai and Mito Hollyhock -- are able to resume their fixtures, or whether those games will be moved to a neutral venue because of damage to their stadiums. Meanwhile, the electricity shortages caused by the after-effects of the earthquake have resulted in the J-League confirming that all matches in April will take place during the day -- a measure that might be extended throughout the rest of the season. That measure has also been taken up by the Japanese baseball Pacific League, who have decided not to stage night games next month in the worse-affected regions of Kanto and Tohoku. In other sport affected by the disaster, Russia have made a bid to stage this year's world figure skating championships. On Sunday, the Japan Skating Federation withdrew their offer to restage the event in October after the original March 21-27 competition in Tokyo was cancelled. Russia, who will stage the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, have proposed to host the event in Moscow from April 25 to May 1. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told reporters: ""We can help out our Japanese colleagues and the international federation by offering them the chance to host the world championships here.""","The Japanese J-League will resume its football fixture list on April 23 .

1004,"(CNN) -- The woman charged in a deadly day care fire that killed four small children is back in Texas, an official said Tuesday. Jessica Tata, who has dual citizenship in the United States and Nigeria, fled to Lagos shortly after the fatal fire at her Houston home in February. She was transported to the Harris County Jail early Tuesday morning, said Christina Garza, a spokeswoman for the Harris County Sheriff's Office. Tata arrived in Atlanta Monday morning and was booked into the Fulton County Jail, officials said in a statement. She made an appearance in magistrate court, where she waived her extradition rights. Investigators allege that Tata, a 22-year-old day care owner, left seven children alone at her Houston day care center with the stove on while she went to a store. Four children died, and three others were injured in the blaze. Tata was taken into custody Saturday in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, by Interpol and U.S. diplomatic security agents, officials said. At a news conference Monday, U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee said Tata turned herself in to authorities after a ""monumental"" effort between the U.S. and Nigerian governments, along with Tata's family in Lagos. ""We now have the opportunity to move forward,"" Lee said, adding that she worked closely with the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and spoke with the Nigerian ambassador to the United Statesto make sure Tata's return was a ""top priority."" On Sunday, Lee gathered with Houston's Nigerian community for a memorial service in honor of the four children lost in the fire, where ministers ""pleaded"" for Tata to return home. U.S. marshals were asked to join the search by Harris County authorities after Tata left the Houston area. They added the missing woman to their 15 Most Wanted Fugitives list in March. Tata has been indicted on felony charges in the fatal fire, including four counts of manslaughter, six counts of reckless injury to a child, three counts of abandoning a child under 15 and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.

1005,"St. Louis (CNN) -- A 1-year-old boy whose family fought a Canadian hospital over whether he should be allowed to die received a tracheotomy at his St. Louis hospital early Monday morning. Officials at the SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center where Joseph Maraachli -- widely known in the media as ""baby Joseph"" -- is being treated, wrote that following a thorough examination by a multi-disciplinary team of specialists and ethicists, a tracheotomy was deemed ""medically appropriate"" for the child. The surgical procedure creates an opening into the airway through an incision in the neck, and a tube allows for suction of fluid out of the lungs. According to the hospital, this creates a safe and stable way to use a mechanical ventilator. Joseph, who was born in January 2010, had been in the care of the London Health Sciences Centre in Canada since October. His doctor, in court papers, said there was no hope for recovery and recommended that the infant's breathing tube be removed and he be allowed to die. The hospital would not perform a tracheotomy because they consider it to be an invasive procedure, one not typically recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine. The child's parents, Moe and Sana Maraachli, refused to comply with court orders and sought instead to have their son transferred to a location where he could get a tracheotomy combined with continued mechanical ventilation and later be transferred home into their care. Physicians at Cardinal Glennon say Joseph suffers from a rare genetic neurometabolic disorder called Leigh Syndrome. According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders. The condition is characterized by the degeneration of the central nervous system and is inherited in most cases. In February, a family spokesperson told CNN the Maraachlis have undergone genetic testing, but no genetic link had been found.

1006,"(CNN) -- The man who killed a University of Connecticut football player in 2009 was sentenced Friday to 18 years in prison for manslaughter in the first degree, said Rockland County Deputy Clerk Tammy Fluet. John Lomax III, 22, stabbed Jasper Howard in the abdomen during a fight outside a campus dance on October 18, 2009. The UConn cornerback died later at a hospital in Hartford, Connecticut. More than 300 people at the dance left the building and spilled out into the street. A fight broke out between two groups, and Howard and another person were stabbed, police said after the incident. The second victim, who was treated and released, was Brian Parker, then 19, another player on the UConn football squad, according to CNN affiliate WTNH. Maj. Ron Blicher of the UConn Police Department said in 2009 that more than 40 investigators from his department and the Connecticut State Police conducted more than 200 interviews during the course of the investigation. The university set up the Jasper T. Howard Endowed Scholarship to honor the slain student athlete.","John Lomax III, 22, was sentenced to 18 years for manslaughter in the first degree .
