1008,"Palau, Mexico (CNN) -- Fermin was a mechanic, not a coal miner, but on the morning of February 19, 2006 he had to go down into the Pasta de Conchos mine near here to fix a broken cart that couldn't haul the coal out. Five years later, Fermin's remains are still more than 100 meters (109 yards) below the ground, together with dozens of miners who worked that night. Daniel Ezquiel, Fermin's only son, doesn't remember his father. He was just 1 year old when ""the mine swallowed the miners."" So that he won't forget, his mother, Maria de Lourdes, sets aside part of her widow's pension -- 2,200 pesos a month -- to buy any newspaper that publishes something about the incident. She cuts articles and photos, and pastes them in an album. That Sunday, just past 2:30 a.m., an explosion left 65 miners buried who were working inside the Pasta de Conchos mine, in the Mexican state of Coahuila, in northern Mexico. The mine is owned by Grupo Mexico, one of the largest mining companies in the country. Then-President Vicente Fox never visited the relatives mourning at the mine site. President Felipe Calderon has also avoided meeting with the more than 300 family members. After five years, the relatives and about five widows continue asking for the bodies to be retrieved from the mine. Citing dangerous conditions, the company abandoned the attempts to pull them out. Maria de Lourdes says that a year and a half ago, she stopped receiving the 420 pesos the-ex governor of Coahuila sent so that the children of the miners could continue studying. She sells baby clothing to complement her income and keep her son in school. She doesn't want Daniel Ezequiel to be a coal miner. There are several versions about the cause of the incident that killed the workers. Grupo Mexico says that there was an explosion caused by a ball of gas -- gas that escapes from the earth at the moment of the coal extraction -- and that as a consequence, the temperature in the mine rose to more than 900 degrees Celsius (1,652 degrees Fahrenheit). However, according to the autopsies of the only two bodies that were pulled from the mine, their deaths were caused by asphyxiation, not burns. Those two bodies were located in the ninth diagonal tunnel in the mine. Grupo Mexico says it went nearly 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) into the mine, but hadn't found the other remains. In February 2007, the Coahuila state government produced 65 death certificates certified by a medical examiner, even though only two bodies had been recovered. With 63 bodies still underground, Grupo Mexico decided to suspend the rescue of the bodies in April 2007. At that time, the company argued that according to their investigations, 25% to 75% of the mine was flooded and ""the water possibly is contaminated by HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis, that could contaminate the rescuers, their families and entire populations."" These findings were given to the Pasta de Conchos Family Organization, which has advised the victims' relatives. Inspection records from a few months before the blast revealed that the ventilation system was failing and that there were problems with the electrical equipment. Some family members say the workers complained of a strong odor of gas. Through a spokesman, Grupo Mexico declined to speak about the incident, citing internal policies. Cristina Auerbach, lawyer for the victims' relatives in the Pasta de Conchos Family Organization, said that explosions in the regions' mines had been recorded since 1889. Even then, the only times that bodies were left inside the mine were 1889 and 2006. In the rest of the cases, the bodies were always recovered, alive or dead. Auerbach recalled one of the biggest blasts that happened in 1969 in the town of Barroteran. In the Guadalupe mines, more than 160 people died. A little over a year later, all the bodies were recovered. ""The question isn't whether Chile could and Mexico couldn't, because the answer that they will give is that it was different because that mine was mineral and this one was coal, and this one had gas and that one didn't. What you can compare is the government's attitude,"" she said. ""Neither Vicente Fox nor Felipe Calderon has wanted to meet the families. Not only that, but in coal mining region, the bodies are always rescued. Only at Pasta de Conchos they are not."" In northeast Coahuila, it's common to find someone who has a miner in the family. Walking down the streets of towns like Nueva Rosita, Palau, San Juan Sabinas and Muzquiz, you can see trucks full of freshly mined coal at all hours. At the end of each shift -- around 3 p.m., 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. -- trucks pass by with men whose faces are painted black by the carbon dust that fell on them during their 12 hours of work. Nearly all the coal in Mexico is produced in Coahuila, according to the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Information. Raul Villasana, retired at age 67, also was a miner. He worked for more than 20 years in Grupo Mexico's mines. One of his sons remains inside Pasta de Conchos. He and his wife Trinidad have traveled several times to Mexico City to participate in demonstrations in front of Grupo Mexico and the Labor Ministry to plead for the excavation of their son. ""We were recently at the Interior Ministry in November and what I asked for was my son's rescue. I have asked for that since the beginning. Because the mine is not a cemetery, right? It's for people to work in,"" he said. ""What we are asking the company and the government to do is to give the bodies to us, so we can do a holy burial and take him flowers, go see him, go visit him with his daughters, wife, sister, who also have asked for this."" Villasana's son left behind a son and two daughters. The widow decided to invest the 750,000 pesos that the family received from the company to set up a used clothes business that she supplies from the United States. Maria de Lourdes, Fermin's widow, knows the mining life well. Her father, Arsenio, was also a miner. He mined black gold from Pasta de Conchos. He retired several years before the blast. Five years after the tragedy, she says some rescuers have dared to confess that at night they heard ""noises like pickaxes striking on metal."" Arsenio thinks those were the sounds of the last surviving miners. ""Though after all that time there is no way that they could come out alive,"" he stated. For residents like Villasana and Arsenio, Pasta de Conchos turned from a mine into a cemetery the morning of February 19. 2006.","5 years ago, explosion buried 65 coal miners .

1009,"(CNN) -- In Futaba, Japan, the threat of death by radiation poisoning is not enough to compel some residents to obey the Japanese government's order to leave their homes. Futaba is within the 12-mile evacuation zone surrounding the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant where crews are struggling to contain radiation spilling out of the facility -- a disaster created by a March 11 earthquake-triggered tsunami. The nuclear accident has turned Futaba into a ghost town, almost. Trains no longer run to this northern Japan farming community. The clean-up of the damage wrought by the earthquake has not started and the only people on the streets are members of Japan's self-defense forces, all dressed head to toe in protective clothing. However, government forces conducting house-by-house searches have found people who refuse to get out of Futaba. Some say they are too sick or old to leave their homes. Others say they stayed behind, or managed to return, to feed their animals. ""We've come to help you go to the evacuation center,"" a security forces officer told one woman during a recent visit to her home. ""No, no, we cannot go,"" the woman replied. The woman said she couldn't leave because her husband suffers from Alzheimer's disease and has a bad leg that renders him unable to get out of bed. When the officer told the woman her daughter is worried about her, the woman still refused to obey the evacuation order. A security forces member told CNN that two days after the visit, they managed to persuade the woman to leave Futaba with her husband. ""We are explaining how serious the situation is to people, because radiation is something you can't see with your eyes,"" said Kei Higuchi, a representative of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. ""However, some of those who remain in the danger zone, find adapting to a new environment even more challenging,"" Higuchi said, ""so they want to stay at home."" Stubborn residents aren't the only problem complicating the evacuation, according to security forces. Earthquake damage to roads has made it difficult to travel through the area. Nevertheless, government officials remain adamant that residents who live within 12 miles of the Fukushima plant must leave. ""We would like to request once again that residents stay away because it's a very risky area with contamination, Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said. ""We urge residents not to return to the 20 kilometer (12 mile) radius area.""

1010,"Rikuzen-Takata, Japan (CNN) -- At a hospital in northeastern Japan, the remnants of lives stolen in seconds are scattered on each of its four floors. Metal beds are bent, I-V bags are filled with muddy water, and blood pressure monitors sit underneath splintered trees. But Takata Hospital nurse Fumiko Suzuki doesn't just see the damage, she hears the haunted screams of the patients she could not save. ""The patients couldn't walk,"" said Suzuki, recalling the moment the tsunami hit. ""I heard someone screaming, 'Auntie, I can't save you. I'm sorry.' Then she ran out of the room."" Suzuki said a glance out of the window revealed a wave as high as the fourth floor. The nurse said she told the patient ""I'm sorry"" as she raced up the stairs. ""If I tried to save this person who was lying on the bed, I would have lost my life as well,"" she said. Suzuki pauses, grief etched on her face. ""It is the biggest regret I have,"" she said of leaving patients behind. The tsunami following the 9.0-magnitude earthquake on March 11 engulfed every floor of the hospital just as Suzuki stepped onto the roof. At least 10,901 were killed nationwide. Of the 51 patients hospitalized, doctors and nurses could not move 12 and they drowned in their beds, said Mikihito Ishiki, a medical director at the hospital. One patient died as the hospital staff moved him to the roof while two more died on the frigid roof awaiting rescue. ""Ten of my staff also died with the patients,"" Ishiki said. The doctor lost his staff, his patients and the hospital he proudly called his home. His wife remains missing and is presumed dead. As soon as rescuers plucked the doctor from the engulfed building, he started working from a makeshift clinic on higher ground. The doctor's composure cracks as he lifts a handwritten note from a satellite phone sitting in his clinic. ""Yokosawa is helping us from heaven,"" he reads, referring to a 60-year-old hospital administrator, Shigeru Yokosawa, set to retire in April. After the tsunami warning, Ishiki asked Yokosawa to find the satellite phone on the first floor of the hospital. Satellite phones are vital lines of communication after a natural disaster because phone lines are usually knocked out. Yokosawa got the phone and moments before a massive wave swallowed him, tossed it to a colleague, who ran to the roof. Seconds later, the tsunami engulfed the hospital. His sacrifice is part of the reason Ishiki won't leave this clinic, now fully operational and treating patients across Rikuzen-Takata. His fellow survivors tirelesslesly work along him. Suzuki, who brought her elderly and sick mother to the clinic, said the doctors and nurses can't feel guilty for surviving the disaster. ""When I hear that,"" she said, ""it breaks my heart. It's a natural disaster. They want to save everyone, but in this situation, they can't."" Suzuki said she is grateful to see familiar faces of her colleagues, and hope they realize they are making a difference in the present. She pushes her pain -- the loss of her home, her friends and her relatives -- to the back of her mind as she focuses on her patients. The town has given her not just a refuge from the pain, but donations of clothes for days she's not wearing her nurse uniform. ""Whatever the situation, I will stay here. Talking with the patients will be my cure. I feel like I'm not the one taking care of others, but the one being taken care of,"" she said.","Doctors, nurses focus on caring for patients despite their losses .

1012,"(CNN) -- For days, the wounded just kept coming to the 60-bed central hospital in Misrata, a city under siege from forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. But there were no empty beds, no electricity -- only generator power. No anesthesia or painkillers. A doctor said 109 people have died in Misrata over the past week. Six were killed Thursday by Gadhafi's rooftop snipers -- unseen but too often precise. More than 1,300 others have been wounded since the protests erupted in the western city last month. People flooded the hospital, wounded in war that has raged between the opposition and Gadhafi's forces. The strongman's tanks have been pounding the city and bombs fell Thursday near the hospital, the doctor said. Residents reported a reprieve after coalition airstrikes targeted the Libyan military. But rooftop snipers kept taking aim. And the doctors kept doing their work. They treated patients in corridors, and operated on them even without anesthesia. They sent people with what the doctor called lesser injuries home to recuperate -- including people whose legs and arms were amputated. ""We don't have the space,"" he said, the weariness in his voice apparent even on a poor phone connection from Libya. Snipers surrounded the hospital, he said. Thursday, patients were to a clinic. But the injured in the city could no longer seek help at the hospital. The snipers were shooting at the ambulances. The coalition began airstrikes last Saturday and has been able to establish a no-fly zone that spans from east to west along Libya's coastline. But Gadhafi's forces are far from defeated. They camped on the periphery of Misrata, trying to wrest it from opposition control, and leaving its people, including those at the central hospital, in a dire situation.","A doctor tells CNN that 109 people were killed in Misrata over the past week .

1013,"(CNN) -- Harry Wesley Coover, best-known as the inventor of Super Glue, has died at his home in Kingsport, Tennessee, a funeral home there said Sunday. He was 94. The cause of death was congestive heart failure. Coover got the idea for Super Glue during a lab accident while working for Eastman Kodak, said Hamlett-Dobson Funeral Homes. He was studying compounds for use in optically perfect gun sights and impact-resistant jet canopies when an assistant complained that new refractometer prisms were wrecked because they got glued together, according to the funeral home. In fact, cyanoacrylate -- the chemical name for the glue -- was rejected by researchers at first because it bound everything together. But Coover saw its potential. The glue was first sold as a commercial product in 1958, according to the Super Glue Corp.'s website. It has since become synonymous with curiously powerful adhesives. Coover was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation last year for his work. He is survived by two sons, a daughter and four grandchildren.","He hit upon the idea of Super Glue during a lab accident .

While the hospital would not release details of his treatment, an announcer on Buffett's Sirius XM channel ""Radio Margaritaville"" said he received several stitches for a cut to his head. He misjudged where the stage ended because of footlights, the announcer said. A video of the incident posted on YouTube shows Buffett closing his concert in Sydney's Hordern Pavilion with his song ""Lovely Cruise."" ""Thank you, good night and God bless,"" Buffett told his fans. After he put his guitar down, Buffett walked toward the cheering crowd with his arms raised. The video showed the singer taking one step too many, dropping off the front edge of the stage. Jimmy Buffett and his Coral Reefer Band have performed several sold-out shows in Sydney over the past week, Australia's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.

1015,"New York (CNN) -- A National Transportation Safety Board investigation has revealed new facts about the Bronx crash that killed 15 people in early March, with the head of the NTSB issuing renewed calls for changes in bus safety and regulation of bus companies. One of the primary findings of the investigation so far is that contrary to bus driver Ophadell Williams statement to authorities that a tractor-trailer may have clipped the bus causing the accident, the NTSB engineer who examined the bus found no evidence to indicate that a truck had come into contact with it, NTSB chairman Deborah Hersman told CNN. The investigation found that the bus, with the 40-year-old Williams at the wheel, drifted to the right before striking a roadside barrier, Hersman said Wednesday in testimony to a Senate hearing on bus safety. After hitting the barrier, the bus rolled and skidded for nearly 500 feet before colliding with a highway signpost that penetrated the windshield and speared the entire length of the bus, killing 15 passengers, according to Hersman. Investigators determined that the bus was traveling at 78 miles per hour at some point between leaving the Connecticut casino and the scene of the accident, while the speed limit at that stretch of roadway was 50 miles per hour for commercial vehicles, Hersman told CNN. A camera was also mounted on the bus windshield when the bus crashed, but it did not record the accident, the NTSB reported in a press release. The crash happened in the early hours of March 12 on the New England Thruway near the border of Westchester and the Bronx. En route from the Mohegan Sun Resort and Casino, the ""World Wide Tours"" bus was bound for Chinatown in Manhattan. ""Unlike when travelers get in their own automobiles, passengers boarding a motor coach place their lives in the hands of the motor coach operator and its driver,"" Hersman said Wednesday of the industry that transports 750 million passengers per year. This accident, along with other recent, serious motor coach crashes in New Jersey and New Hampshire, has led the NTSB to renew its emphasis bus safety recommendations. The first NTSB recommendation is to improve passenger protection with stronger roofs, a redesign of window emergency exits and improved standards for passenger seating compartments. The NTSB also recommended better government oversight of both drivers and vehicles, as well as more advanced vehicle technologies, such as forward-collision warning systems. The Department of Transportation currently is working on rules covering the recommendations, Hersman said in her testimony. The full report of what happened is expected to be completed within 12 months, a spokesman for the NTSB, Peter Knudson, told CNN.","Fifteen people died in a Bronx bus crash in early March .

1016,"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The use of U.S. strike aircraft in Libya is set to expire Monday as uncertainty lingers about whether Western allies will arm opposition members trying to oust Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi. Over the weekend, fierce destruction permeated the city of Misrata, which has been choked off by pro-Gadhafi forces surrounding the city. ""We need a lot of help in Misrata. There's so much death there,"" said Mustafa Abdul Hamali, a 46-year-old taxi driver who lost half of a leg. ""I was driving in my car with my wife, and my car just blew up. I don't know what happened."" Khalid Moteridi, a 32-year-old businessman-turned-rebel fighter, said the situation in Libya's third-largest city has turned dire. ""It¹s a tragedy by all means,"" he said. ""No electricity, no food, no water. We¹re trapped from all sides by the Gadhafi forces."" A doctor in Misrata told CNN government forces shelled a clinic, leaving one dead and 15 injured on Sunday. Last week, a hospital official said 398 people have been killed since the Libyan conflict began last month. He feared there were more deaths that his hospital didn't know about. Some rebels from Misrata got a bit of a reprieve Sunday, when a Turkish hospital ship picked up more than 300 of the wounded fighters. Their injuries included amputated limbs, broken bones and shrapnel wounds. The ship is destined for the Turkish port of Cesme, where the patients will receive medical attention, opposition officials said. It made a stop in the rebel capital of Benghazi to pick up more patients and supplies, and was greeted by cheering supporters of the opposition. Men wearing head bandages and eye patches waved back at the crowd. West of Benghazi, the tug-of-war for control continued in the oil town of al-Brega, which has changed hands six times in six weeks between government and opposition forces. Rebel fighters retreated east of al-Brega on Sunday, reporting an ambush, roadside mines and a need for more ammunition. Libyan rebels have been hampered by a lack of organization and training on heavy weaponry when confronting the better-trained, better-armed forces of Gadhafi, who is under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. ""We were fighting with light weapons, but they had so much more,"" Moteridi said. ""Artillery, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, anti-tank rockets -- that's how they were fighting back."" U.S. and British officials have said they have not decided whether to arm rebel fighters. Both countries participated in airstrikes to weaken Gadhafi's military resources before NATO officially took command of the international operation. Due to poor weather conditions in recent days, the United States approved a request by NATO to extend the use of some U.S. strike aircraft, NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said Sunday. ""This is a short-term extension, which expires on Monday,"" Lungescu said. Over the weekend, opposition spokesmen said 13 rebels were killed when NATO airstrikes hit several vehicles. ""Based on the information we have, they (the opposition forces who were hit) heard the airstrikes and went ahead to see what the damage was, and that's when they got hit,"" rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said. ""They were told to stay back, but they jumped the gun."" Lungescu said Saturday that NATO was investigating the incident. ""NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously, but exact details are hard to verify as we have no reliable sources on the ground,"" she said. Meanwhile, a trip to Europe by Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi indicated Gadhafi's regime might be willing to take diplomatic steps. Libya asked Greece to allow a special envoy to travel there to communicate a message from Gadhafi, Greek foreign ministry spokesman Grigoris Delavekouras said. The nature of that message was not immediately known. ""From what the Libyan envoy said, it is clear that the administration is looking for a solution,"" Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said after the meeting. He said Obeidi is expected to continue talks in Turkey and Malta . Despite the unyielding conflict, Moteridi, the rebel fighter who was shot twice in the legs by a sniper, said he won't give up. ""I'll go back to Misrata when I get better, God willing, and ... Gadhafi and his gangs will be defeated.""

1017,"Tokyo (CNN) -- First come the blackouts, then come the blues ... at least from worried business owners in disaster-hit Japan. In the end, the rolling outages may wind up being a bigger drag on the Japanese economy than the initial damage from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The area that relies on electric power from the Tokyo Electric Power Co., including Tokyo, accounts for more than half the economy of Japan, so any outages have long-ranging and sometimes unexpected consequences. A fast-food noodle factory in Saitama, just north of Tokyo, is but one example. For 63 years, the Kuritaeimu Derica has turned out precooked noodle dishes with fresh ingredients for sale in convenience stores. But managing director Sawako Kurita said the family business is at risk of shutting down and cutting hundreds of employees. Kurita's problems run all up and down the intensely choreographed production chain. Each day 300 workers at the spotless suburban factory turn out 80,000 packages of 120 varieties of noodle dishes, relying on dozens of vendors for ingredients. The factory lost some food and flour during the quake, but Kurita said the days afterward were far harder to deal with at the plant. Dozens of foreign workers fled back to their home countries after word spread of the dangerous and still ongoing nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Then pre-announced blackouts forced the factory to shut down for three-hour periods, often during peak production. And Kurita said it takes hours before and after each shutdown to get the machines up and working. ""Our factory has no windows so we can't leave our workers inside,"" Kurita said. ""We have to take them out to the office or the cafeteria, and for three hours we give them some food and drinks because we feel bad for them just waiting to start again."" The hourly employees get no pay for the wait. And most are mothers, often with children in the company day care center who don't have flexible schedules to work around blackouts. Sayuri Kimura, 38, said she's worried about the cuts and how to provide for her young son. ""I think the planned blackouts are inevitable, and it seems working hours and income will go down, so we're all worried about that,"" she said while on break at the factory. And the problem's not only in Saitama -- the ingredients from farmers are also in constant flux. Kurita explained they are scrambling to buy vegetables and meat from areas outside the affected prefectures where they had relied on food from before. Fuel shortages and quake-damaged roads also hamper deliveries, blackouts let fresh foods spoil, and sometimes trucks are stuck behind electrically powered warehouse doors. Then there are problems with how to get the goods to customers. Kurita said many stores are shut and customers are short of cash across the Tohoku area, meaning revenues are taking a hit. Tokyo Electric has been able largely to avoid blackouts in recent days as cool weather and customer cutbacks have led to nearly a 25% reduction in demand around Tokyo, the company said. Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Tuesday that he prefers industry and individuals to cut back voluntarily, but Tokyo Electric has warned that as temperatures rise and air conditioners get switched on, companies may be forced to trim power use by a fifth, or face mandatory cuts. At the Kurita factory, a few small generators sit outside with makeshift power chords snaking along the floor to ensure they can keep phones and computers working to take orders. But a generator large enough to power the factory would take months to find and deliver, and regulations ban big units near the apartments that crowd all around the plant. Kurita said she's tried to bring aid to the worst-hit tsunami areas, personally delivering tens of thousands of noodle packs to the survivors in the Tohoku region. But she said now the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric must help her and other small businesses out. ""As you see in the factory, all the products come down a line, so if we're asked for a 20% reduction in power we have to stop everything,"" Kurita said, sighing. ""We didn't suffer badly in the quake and have to do our part to help ... but we can't afford to cut 20% and keep on in business.""","Rolling outages have long-range and unexpected consequences to Japan's economy .

1018,"(CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board will probe part of the country's tour bus industry in the wake of a deadly crash in New York last month, two lawmakers announced Sunday. The NTSB will ""launch a broad investigation into the entire safety regime that governs the low-cost tour bus industry,"" Sen. Charles Schumer and Rep. Nydia Velazquez said. The two New York Democrats said the decision is the result of their urging following a March 12 accident that killed 15 people. ""March's bus crash was a tragedy for New York, but these passengers did not have to die in vain,"" Schumer said in a statement Sunday. ""A full and comprehensive review of this industry and the safety regulations governing it will no doubt lead to greater safety standards for the thousands of passengers who use these buses every week."" ""By ensuring NTSB thoroughly reviews how this industry is regulated, we can keep passengers safe, while restoring consumers' confidence in this type of travel,"" Velazquez said in the statement. A similar NTSB review of airline safety ""led to major improvements,"" the joint statement by the lawmakers' offices said. Schumer has also asked New York state's Department of Motor Vehicles to re-examine all drivers of low-cost tour buses for previous safety violations and suspended licenses. If such an audit had taken place before the March 12 crash, it would have shown that the driver ""shouldn't have been behind the wheel,"" Schumer said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered an investigation into how the driver in the crash, Ophadell Williams, got a commercial license despite having a poor driving record and previous convictions of grand larceny and manslaughter. Records on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration website showed that the bus line involved -- World Wide Travel -- was involved in a crash in New York in 2009 that resulted in one injury and a crash in New Jersey in 2010 resulting in another. The company has been cited five times for ""fatigued driving"" between December 2009 and October 2010 -- twice in New Jersey, twice in Pennsylvania and once in Connecticut, records show. Police said Williams told investigators that the incident occurred the morning of March 12 after he swerved to avoid a tractor-trailer that might have clipped the bus. The bus then flipped on its side and smashed into poles, which cut through two-thirds of the vehicle. Williams has not been charged. His license was suspended on March 17 after the Department of Motor Vehicles turned over to investigators driver license applications that allegedly contained false statements. Two survivors of the Bronx bus accident have filed multimillion-dollar lawsuits against the bus company and against Williams. Yuke Chue Lo and Erold Jean Marie are suing World Wide Tours and Williams for $20 million and $200 million, respectively. Both passengers' court papers allege negligence on the part of the bus operating company for allowing Williams behind the wheel, with that resulting in the deadly crash on March 12. They also allege that Williams was speeding and fell asleep while driving. Williams' lawyer, Sean H. Rooney, has denied that his client fell asleep behind the wheel. He also said Williams does not drink, smoke or use drugs and had passed three Breathalyzer tests and given a blood sample following the crash. Rooney called his client an ""easy target,"" but insisted that he is ""a decent person."" The case has shone light on safety questions surrounding the industry. On one day in March, the state Department of Transportation inspected 14 buses and found violations in every case -- either vehicle violations, which took the buses out of service, or driver violations or both, said agency spokeswoman Deborah Sturm Rausch. The nine driver violations could include anything from a driver with an out-of-date license to one who had logged too many hours on the road, Rausch said. On another day in March, random roadside inspections of 36 commercial buses by troopers resulted in 10 drivers being removed from their buses by their companies and eight traffic tickets issued. None of the vehicles inspected was found inoperable, according to the New York State Department of Transportation.","Sen. Schumer: NTSB investigation will yield greater safety standards .

1020,"(CNN) -- Leading Japanese golfers Ai Miyazoto, Mika Miyazoto and Momuku Ueda have joined forces in launching a website to aid the rescue effort in their native country following the recent earthquake and tsunami. Speaking ahead of this week's $1.7 million Kia Classic in California, the trio revealed they have created a fund-raising website for a relief organization to combat the devastation. All three players, who were in Japan when the disaster struck, have designed buttons with a Japanese logo which translates into: ""Never Give Up Japan"". They will be wearing the buttons on their caps during this week's LPGA event and have also distributed them to their fellow-players in an effort to promote the website further. Current world number one Yani Tseng wore one of the buttons at her press conference for the tournament.

1021,"(CNN) -- Just days after a Boeing 737 flown by Southwest Airlines made an emergency landing with a hole in its fuselage, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a press release Monday that it will mandate operators of about 175 specific older Boeing 737s to conduct inspections for wear and tear. The FAA said the ""emergency directive"" it plans to issue on Tuesday would affect about 80 U.S.-registered 737-300s, 737-400s and 737-500s, mostly operated by Southwest. The remaining 95 or so aircraft are registered outside the United States. Each of the 175 or so planes in question have taken off and landed more than 30,000 times and will receive repetitive electromagnetic inspections at regular intervals for fatigue damage. In a separate statement, Boeing said it was working with the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board and Southwest, and it was preparing a service bulletin to recommend lap joint inspections on certain 737 models. NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said Monday that inspectors have visually checked lap joints in the past, but haven't used high-tech monitoring, because no one thought that part of the plane was susceptible to cracks. Moving forward, inspectors will test the joints with an electromagnetic process. The chairman on the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation said in a statement that the American public wants answers to retain confidence in commercial air travel. ""As the details of this unusual incident unfold, we will get a better understanding of what caused the plane's fuselage to tear open,"" said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia. ""I expect the FAA to be painstakingly diligent in reviewing the safety of all aircraft, and to conduct a careful investigation into what caused the cracks that have been discovered on the bodies of these planes."" Rockefeller took advantage of the occasion to renew his call for reauthorizing the FAA. ""The FAA reauthorization bill now headed to conference takes steps to strengthen the inspection process of passenger aircraft, and I hope we can move that bill quickly to a resolution,"" he said. After Southwest canceled about 600 flights over the weekend to accommodate inspections, the airline said it canceled another 70 flights on Monday. By 3:30 p.m. Monday, the company had checked out 67 of the 79 planes it had grounded for inspection. Southwest said 64 of the 737-300s were being returned to service, while inspectors had discovered subsurface cracks on three jets. Those three will remain out of service ""until Boeing recommends an appropriate repair,"" Southwest said. As planes are cleared, they will be put back into service, Southwest said. Inspections are expected to be completed by late Tuesday. The airline recommended that customers should check with the website SWA.com for the status of a particular flight or rebook a trip before heading to the airport. Eighteen minutes into Flight 812 from Phoenix to Sacramento, California, on Friday, a hole 5 feet long and 1 foot wide opened in the fuselage, causing the cabin to lose pressure, the NTSB said. One flight attendant received minor injuries, the agency said. The pilot initially planned to return to Phoenix, but he made an emergency landing at a military base in Yuma, Arizona, after flight attendants reported seeing blue sky through the jet's roof, the safety board's Robert Sumwalt told reporters. Some of the 118 passengers who were aboard the crippled Boeing 737 said they feared for their lives. ""We were in shock,"" passenger Debbie Downey said Saturday. ""We were in row 16, and my husband and I could see blue sky ... the wiring, the cabling. It actually was terrifying."" Greg Hansen said fellow passengers panicked and screamed as the sun shone through the cabin. ""Most people were just white knuckles, holding on to the arm rests,"" he said. The airline said it provided a full refund, an apology and two complimentary round-trip passes on the airline for future flights. In July 2009, another Southwest Airlines 737-300 made an emergency landing when cabin pressure dropped because of a football-size hole in the jet. That incident prompted the airline to inspect its entire fleet of 737-300s. Earlier that same year, the airline was fined $7.5 million by the FAA after the agency found that Southwest operated 46 of its Boeing 737s on nearly 60,000 flights without performing mandatory inspections for fatigue cracks in their fuselages. Sumwalt said the 737 used for Flight 812 had a maintenance check in March at Southwest's Dallas facility, and the jet had no outstanding maintenance issues at the time of the accident, with all its records ""positive, up to date, (and) with no discrepancies."" The plane's flight data recorders had no noteworthy information on them, Sumwalt said.

1022,"(CNN) -- Firefighters in Texas worked Monday to contain fast-moving wildfires that had destroyed at least 60 homes, burned more than 130,000 acres, and caused an accident that killed a 5-year-old child, state forestry officials said. The fires broke out about noon on Sunday, said Lewis Kearney, a spokesman for the forest service's Texas State Lone Star Incident Management Team. Officials believe many were started by power lines that fell from high winds. Since Sunday, forestry officials, who were called in to assist local fire departments, responded to 63 fires covering 132,854 acres, the Texas Forest Service said on its website. Most of the fires were across the Texas Panhandle, Kearney said. Potter County Sheriff Brian Thomas said a 61,000-acre fire in his county was ignited when a man cut pipe with a metal grinder in high wind Sunday. Austin Lynn Stephens, 52, was arrested and charged with criminal trespass because he was on private property when he was using the grinder. Firefighters battled blazes in a dozen other counties including a 35,000-acre fire in Matador West in Motley County, and a 21,000-acre fire in Andrews County. They also fought fires in the counties of Haskell, Tom Green, Randall, Howard, Midland, Scurry, Motley, Crockett, Mitchell and Eastland. Crews that worked through the night to douse the flames got a little help from the weather Monday. The wind that propelled the fires was somewhat calmer, although it was still breezy and parts of the area remained under a fire-weather watch. Kearney said Sunday's high winds made it difficult for firefighters to use aircraft to battle the blaze. Interstate 20 was shut down for several hours Sunday after heavy smoke from the fires limited visibility. Authorities in Midland County responded to numerous accidents along the highway, including an eight-vehicle crash in which a little girl died, according to Sgt. Pete Cordova. One wildfire destroyed a dog kennel near Amarillo, said Capt. Wes Hall of the Amarillo Fire Department. Authorities were trying to account Monday for the animals missing or dead after the fire tore through the Willow Creek Kennel. Firefighters were able to open cages to free at least some of the dogs before the flames overtook the facility. As many as 27 homes were destroyed in the area and ""the fire was on the kennel in a matter of minutes,"" employee Chance Smith said, adding he did not have an exact number of dogs lost. In the community of Matador, north of Lubbock, families could do nothing but watch as their homes burned to the ground. The Segovias hadn't been gone 20 minutes when they returned to a panic-stricken neighborhood and found they had lost everything they owned. ""To know everything you worked so hard for, it's all gone,"" a tearful Juan Segovia told CNN affiliate KCBD. He and his wife, Rosemary, stared in disbelief at the blaze. The family of seven is without a home, but grateful for what was not lost. ""I'm glad our family wasn't home when it happened,"" Rosemary Segovia said before falling into her husband's arms. ""That's all I care about is I have my family."" One firefighter sustained second-degree burns battling a blaze near Colorado City, where a nursing home had to be evacuated before the fast moving flames swept through. And a Potter County sheriff's deputy narrowly escaped the flames while searching homes after a mandatory evacuation was ordered for the Mesilla Park area. Deputy Kevin Parvin entered a home as the flames were bearing down on the neighborhood, Thomas said, and by the time he left the home, the smoke was so thick he couldn't find his patrol car. Parvin had left the car running, and he followed the sound of a squeaking engine belt to find it and radio for assistance, Thomas said. He was treated for minor smoke inhalation. No other injuries were reported. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report .","Man accused of sparking one fire with a metal grinder .

1023,"(CNN) -- Two people were injured when a parcel bomb exploded on Thursday in the offices of a Swiss umbrella group for the nuclear industry, police said. The incident occurred in the offices of Swissnuclear in the town of Olten. The pair suffered minor injuries and were taken to a hospital. Police are investigating and Swissnuclear could not be immediately reached for comment. Matthieu Buchs, spokesman of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, confirmed that the approval process for three new nuclear power plants had been stopped because of the disaster in Japan. Safety standards will be reviewed in all existing nuclear power plants, he said. Buchs also said Switzerland derives 39.3% of its electricity from nuclear energy. Nuclear energy makes up 10% of the overall production of energy in the country, he said. Journalist Roman Lehberger contributed to this report.","The incident occurs in Olten .

1024,"Denver, Colorado (CNN) -- A charter flight carrying family members of U.S. military service members serving in Japan landed Thursday on U.S. soil in Denver. The flight contained 144 people who voluntarily left Japan in the wake of the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami and ongoing concerns about the crippled Fukushima Daichi nuclear power plant. Weary from a 14-hour journey,  the families and 18 pets filed into a hangar converted into a welcome center. Representatives from all four branches of the military and Red Cross volunteers were on hand to give them food and water and help get them to their final destinations around the country. About half of the passengers were children who immediately set about playing in a dragon-shaped ""moonbounce"" and by tossing footballs around with the service members on hand to help. One of the parents was Airman 1st Class Megan Pencook of the Air Force, clutching her 5-week-old son, Adrian. Pencook is stationed at Yokota Air base near Tokyo. She was holding her son when the earthquake hit. ""I felt huge shaking. I was feeding my son and just holding him to me and trying to remember what earthquake safety was. I was shaking so bad,"" Pencook said. ""It was the scariest experience of my life."" The child¹s father is an Air Force airman serving in Korea. He wanted them to leave riight after the earthquake, but Pencook wanted to stay in Japan, a country she has grown to love. ""Then I heard of radiation positioning in the water in Tokyo and I said, 'It's time to go,"" she said. When she landed in Denver there were service members on hand to help her with Adrian and make sure she had whatever she might need. ""It feels so good to know that in a crisis, your military family is there for you,"" she said. The chartered Delta jet first touched down in Seattle where all aboard were screened for radiation. ""Every international flight is monitored and there have been no significant amounts of radiation,"" said Army Col. Marc Hutson. As the afternoon wore on, the hangar resembled a children's birthday party as much as a military operation. Footballs flying, moon-bouncers bouncing and dogs chasing each other. Hutson took in the scene with a smile. ""It's awesome. These are our families; this could be my family coming back. Morale is high,"" he said.","A charter flight brings 144 Americans home from Japan .

1025,"(CNN)  -- A year ago, the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history began on April 20 -- which, ironically, also marked Earth Day. The catastrophe started with a massive explosion on an offshore oil drilling rig that killed 11 workers and sparked a huge fire that eventually sank the rig. More than 200 million gallons of crude oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico over the next five months, killing thousands of marine animals and affecting thousands of people in the fishing industry -- already struggling in the economic downturn. CNN's full coverage of the Gulf oil disaster . The exact toll on the Gulf's ecosystem is still as murky as the ocean waters affected by the disaster. This year, as Earth Day approaches, tragedy and uncertainty may once again temper the mood of the annual event: Japan is still assessing what could be its worst environmental disaster -- the damage to its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The situation has forced other countries, including the United States, to take a closer look at the safety of nuclear power plants within their borders. The nuclear issue is still a fierce topic of debate, and environmental experts think it will be an important theme for this year's Earth Day on April 22. Recent polls suggest that Americans are divided over nuclear energy. More than half of the 1,012 respondents in a recent CNN poll said they opposed building more nuclear plants, while 46% said they favored it. When asked by CNN if they are OK with nuclear energy as a source of electricity, 57% of the respondents said they approved, while 42% disapproved. Despite the crisis in Japan, nuclear energy is still a centerpiece of President Obama's clean energy policy. His administration's fiscal year 2012 budget request includes $36 billion in loan guarantee authority to help spur growth in the nuclear industry. Energy secretary defends U.S. nuclear industry . Nuclear energy produces practically no pollution, and it is more reliable than other clean alternative sources -- like wind and solar energy -- that depend on the weather, according to nuclear power advocate Burton Richter, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. While nuclear is his favorite clean energy source, there are other ways to create electricity that Richter believes can help achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases. Two years ago, Richter and 34 other Nobel laureates wrote a letter to Obama to encourage him to put more money into alternative energy research, including nuclear, wind and solar energy and renewable fuels. Richter, who also teaches at Stanford University, says the American public needs to pay close attention to how Congress is handling environmental issues. He is worried that too many people in Washington are more concerned about politics than the environment. ""We're not going to see a fee on carbon emissions, we're not going to see cap and trade, we're going to see a fight to see whether the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] is going to be able to regulate anything,"" he predicted. ""It's not going to be a pretty year."" Richter encouraged everyone to use this year's Earth Day to speak out about the environmental issues that they care about. ""They should be thinking about their grandchildren and the world that those children are going to get left with,"" he said.  ""People need to let their government know, let their representatives know, that they are very concerned about this issue and they are going to hold their representatives accountable for their actions."" Besides being a call to action, Earth Day also continues to be a good opportunity for public education, he said. On April 22, Richter says he'll probably be speaking on campus about nuclear power, because Stanford students are interested in what happened in Japan and want to be assured that nuclear power is safe. Michael Vandenbergh, director of the Climate Change Research Network, says he hopes nuclear concerns don't overshadow other pressing environmental issues that Americans should remember as Earth Day approaches. ""We have to continue to discuss climate change, because if we get that problem wrong, many of the other things we talk about in the environmental area won't matter,"" said Vandenbergh, who also teaches at Vanderbilt University Law School. Both professors were encouraged to see that their students -- although probably not as politically outspoken as their counterparts when Earth Day began in 1970 -- are anxious to learn as much as they can about being environmentally friendly. Everyone should realize the importance of doing his or her part to help improve the environment for future generations, Vandenbergh said. ""Sometimes, people focus on the upfront cost rather than on the net benefit,"" Vandenbergh said, referring to the price of more efficient cars, home weatherization products or new heating and cooling units for our houses. ""Individuals have a much larger role than they realize in both contributing to environmental problems and to the solutions.""","Earth Day will be held on April 22 .

1026,"(CNN) -- Amanda Garcia's peaceful life in Saltillo, Mexico, was shaken this past March when she witnessed a military convoy heading at full speed and against traffic on one of the city's important avenues. The lawyer had taken an alternate route to get home sooner and be with her 7-year-old son. It had been a difficult day in Saltillo, the capital of Coahuila state: Seven people had been killed and four police officers were injured in a series of firefights that caused alarm throughout the city, the state attorney general's office said. A few yards from reaching her home, she was stopped at a military checkpoint. ""When I parked I saw at least six soldiers in front of my car, getting out of their vehicle and aiming at me, asking me to get out. One came close to my door and I heard a sound I had never heard before, apparently of a weapon when you take the safety off. Few times in my life had I felt so scared,"" she said. After an inspection, the soldiers told Amanda that they were looking for a vehicle similar to hers and that she was free to return home. ""Usually, the presence of the army does not make me nervous at all, to the contrary. But that day, I really thought they were going to shoot at me,"" she said. ""I've never seen the city so empty."" Two days later, a soldier died and another was injured in a confrontation with suspected drug traffickers, after four cartel roadblocks were reported in various parts of the city, according to the attorney general's office. Saltillo, with some 700,000 residents, is a colonial city that until recently was known for its auto industry -- General Motors, Chrysler and Freightliner have plants there -- and construction. However, the situation has changed progressively until the city has reached notoriety for other reasons. According to a report from intelligence company Stratfor, the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels formed the New Federation, an alliance combating the Zetas cartel, and launched an offensive to control the trafficking routes in Mexico's northeast. ""There were pacts here, and now those pacts are broken and a battle has begun between various criminal groups for this territory. This is evident,"" said Raul Vera, the Catholic bishop of Saltillo. The Coahuila attorney general's office declined to let any of its officials be interviewed to give their version of escalating violence in the region. ""This was something that has been coming for a while, not only the dispute for control of the territory for the routes, but also for control of the population, through terror, (and) control of the economy,"" said Blanca Martinez, director of the Fray Juan de Larios Human Rights Center. In the four years of Felipe Calderon's term so far, more than 34,612 drug-related killings have been recorded in Mexico, of which 659 happened in northern Coahuila, according to the federal government. Of these, a little more than 3% occurred in Saltillo. Like neighboring states Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, all on the U.S. border, Coahuila has seen peaks in violence associated with the capture or killing of important trafficking leaders who had influence in the region. ""The people in the city are afraid. It can be felt in the streets, homes, with friends. All the conversations are about security now,"" said Jorge Muniz, a young graphic designer who lives in the city. The day after the confrontation between security forces and the presumed drug traffickers, a rumor surged on social media that there would be a curfew in Saltillo, something that was denied by Gov. Jorge Torres Lopez. ""Even then the city took its precautions and that false curfew turned into a real curfew,"" Muniz said. ""The city was deserted from five in the afternoon. There were few people in the streets, and after seven at night, it looked like a ghost town, shops closed, with little traffic."" He added, ""I think this is just the beginning of the violent acts. Other nearby cities, like Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo Leon, also started like this and now are cities where they live a climate of strong violence."" Another indicator of the growing insecurity in Saltillo and the rest of Coahuila is the increase in the number of disappearances in the past two years, the majority believed to be linked to organized crime. From 2007 to January 2011, the Fray Juan de Larios Human Rights Center, in coordination with United for Our Disappeared of Coahuila, documented 118 disappearances, of which 91 presumably were related to organized crime, according to a report by the organization. The report indicates that the average age of the victims is 30, the majority are men, and five of them were minors at the time of their disappearance. Five others were women. Only one out of the 118 cases has evidence that the objective of the disappearance was kidnapping. There was never a request for ransom from the others. Another characteristic of the disappearances in Coahuila is that they happen in groups. Only 17 of the victims disappeared individually, and in 23 cases it is alleged that there was involvement by police or the military, the organizations reported. The state attorney general's office declined to comment on the disappearances. Saltillo could be considered a refuge for the Zetas, the U.S. consul in Monterrey, Bruce Williamson, said in February 2010 in a diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks. The cable is full of doubt about the effectiveness of the Mexican military in the fight against organized crime. In another cable from 2009, the consul writes that the security model implemented in Coahuila by then-Gov. Humberto Moreira was inadequate, and described them as ""baby steps.""","Firefights have been recorded in Saltillo, Mexico .

1027,"Tokyo (CNN) -- The leak of highly radioactive water into the Pacific from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant has stopped, Tokyo Electric Power Company said early Wednesday. The leak had stopped as of 5:38 a.m. Wednesday (4:38 p.m. ET), said the company, which runs the plant. Earlier, Tokyo Electric officials had said an attempt to plug the leak had shown a ""significant difference,"" despite the material not setting as hoped. The company had injected a silica-based polymer dubbed ""liquid glass"" to reduce the leak. The utility's assessment comes after the country's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said the substance had not hardened as expected. The material had been pumped from below into the leaking shaft at the plant's No. 2 reactor. The news was a bright spot amid a series of setbacks Japanese authorities faced Tuesday, including the detection of radiation in a fish and news that the water gushing into the Pacific had radiation levels millions of times above the regulatory limit. Readings from samples taken Saturday in the concrete pit outside the turbine building of the No. 2 reactor -- one of six at the crisis-plagued plant -- had radiation 7.5 million times the legal limit, a TEPCO official said. Newer findings, from Tuesday afternoon, showed a sizable drop to 5 million times the norm. Town near nuclear plant rejects Japanese utility's 'token' offer . The utility company also noted Tuesday that the radiation levels diminished sharply a few dozen meters from the leak, consistent with their assessment that the spill might have a minimal effect on sea life. But even in these spots, radiation levels remained several hundred thousand times the legal limit. Both the utility and Japan's nuclear safety agency said they didn't know how much water is leaking into the sea from reactor No. 2. But engineers have had to pour nearly 200 tons of water a day into the No. 2 reactor vessel to keep it cool, and regulators say they believe that is the water leaking out. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said the presence of radioactive iodine ""in one sample of fresh fish"" prompted authorities to regulate the radiation in seafood for the first time. While fishing has been forbidden within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of Fukushima Daiichi, there had been no restrictions on seafood, as there were for some vegetables and milk from certain locales. Now, the same radiation standards that apply to vegetables will apply to ocean products as well. Nuclear crisis explainer . ""The ""provisional ingestion limit, equivalent to vegetables and applied to fish and shellfish, will take effect immediately,"" the Cabinet minister said. Meanwhile, the deliberate dumping of radioactive water into the sea continues, Tokyo Electric said Wednesday. On Tuesday, Edano apologized for the decision to dump the water -- all part of the effort to curb the flow of the more toxic liquid spotted days ago rushing from outside the No. 2 unit. TEPCO said that as of Tuesday evening, more than 5,740 tons had been released -- about half the total volume. The process of expelling contaminated water in the plant's water treatment facility and around several of its reactors began Monday and will take five days, a Tokyo Electric official said. ""The water contains a high level of radiation,"" Edano said of the liquid being dumped into the Pacific. ""We are sorry for this decision we have to make."" Special coverage: Japan earthquake aftermath . The most contaminated batch of this water comes from outside the No. 6 reactor, likely having gotten in via groundwater (and not a breach in the unit itself), officials said. It has a concentration of iodine-131 that would be 100 times more than the maximum amount in tap water that infants could drink, and 10 times more than what would be OK in food. Overall, the dump equates to about 3 million gallons, noted Gary Was, a nuclear engineering professor from the University of Michigan. Yet Hidehiko Nishiyama, a Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency official, said, ""We've decided that discharging the contaminated water into the sea poses no major health hazard."" Experts say this is a fair assessment, given the likelihood the contamination should quickly dilute, especially if the tainted material is largely iodine-131, which loses half its radiation every eight days. ""To put this in perspective, the Pacific Ocean holds about 300 trillion swimming pools full of water, and they are going to release about five swimming pools full,"" said Timothy Jorgensen, chair of the radiation safety committee at Georgetown University Medical Center. ""So hopefully the churning of the ocean and the currents will quickly disperse this so that it gets to very dilute concentrations relatively quickly."" John Till, president of the South Carolina-based Risk Assessment Corp., said he does not expect to see any permanent effects on marine life, even close to the plant. However, he added that officials should monitor radiation levels closely -- in the ocean as well as in seafood that reaches restaurants and markets. U.S. scales back military aid units in Japan . A piece of good news, according to Japanese government reports, is that airborne radiation appears to be steadily falling around northeast Japan. Two measurements from 15 kilometers (nine miles) or less from the plant showed amounts of radioactive iodine-131 at 2 to 3.7 times the legal standard, with levels of a far longer-lasting cesium isotope well below the official limit. Also, utility and government officials have described conditions recently in the Fukushima Daiichi plant's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools as generally stable. There have been exceptions -- like the new need to pump 3-meter-deep water from a drain outside the Nos. 5 and 6 units for fear it could rise, enter nearby turbine buildings and short out power for the units' nuclear fuel cooling systems. But such problems aren't occurring at the same pace, or with the same apparent severity, as was evident weeks ago. The top priority, however, is stopping the water that's been gushing directly into the Pacific through a cracked concrete shaft outside the No. 2 reactor. How to help in Japan relief efforts . Edano said Monday that the decision to dump tainted water from other reactors and the wastewater treatment facility was unavoidable in order to ensure the safety of the No. 2 reactor core. The idea is to expeditiously pump the tainted water from around the No. 2 reactor's turbine building, lowering levels inside so that water no longer rushes out into the sea, a Japanese nuclear safety official said. This came after the first two failed attempts to plug the problematic crack -- one by pouring in concrete, the other using a chemical compound mixed with sawdust and newspaper. Reactors No. 1 and No. 3, which have lower levels of water, need to be drained as well. Tokyo Electric's plan is to pump that water to other storage tanks, including some that still need to be set up. Water in and around the Nos. 5 and 6 reactors is being jettisoned directly in the sea, officials said. Interactive map on Japan crisis . Another big problem may be that authorities still don't know how exactly the gushing water got contaminated, where it came from or how to fix potential leaks and cracks deep inside the reactor complex and nuclear fuel. Michael Friedlander, a former senior U.S. nuclear engineer, said late Monday that authorities will continue to have problems related to excess, radioactive water -- and the need to dump some of it -- as long as they inject huge amounts in to prevent fuel rods from overheating in reactors' cores and spent fuel pools. ""This is not a one-off deal,"" Friedlander said of dumping radioactive water into the ocean. ""This issue of water and water management is going to plague them until they can get (fully operating) long-term core cooling.""

1028,"(CNN) -- The death toll from the latest round of heavy rain and flooding in central Vietnam continues to soar, with 46 people killed and 21 missing, state-run media report. Rescuers were able to save 18 people whose bus was swept away Monday on the north-south highway 1A through Ha Tinh Province, but 19 people remain unaccounted for, according to VietNamNet. The homes of 200,000 people are underwater in Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Bing provinces because of floods caused by storms that began October 14, official media report. On Sunday alone, about 30 inches of rain fell in parts of the country. The storms have hit the southeast Asian nation's agricultural sector hard, with waters inundating 8,000 hectares (31 square miles) of rice fields. Prices of some crops have increased 200 to 500 percent as a result. This storm follows rains and floods at the beginning of October in Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Bing, Quang Tri and Thua Thien provinces that caused an estimated $137.5 million in damage, according to VietNamNet. The two rounds of flood calamities have contributed to the deaths of 112 people, reported state-run television network VTV4, which cited Vietnam's Central Steering Committee for Flood and Storm Control as its source. The Vietnamese government has dispatched 20,000 troops to help with the rescue and recovery process in the latest flooding, with Red Cross staffers from Vietnam, Spain, China, Germany and the United States among those helping the cause, reported VietNamNet. The number of fatalities has climbed significantly in recent days. On Monday, state-run media were reporting that at least 20 people had died. A flood and landslide warning remains in effect for much of the region, with water levels dangerously high in the Ca River in Nghe An province and the Ngan Sau River in Ha Tinh province. Landslides have already dumped tons of dirt and debris, clogging the Pe Ke mountain pass and parts of the Ho Chi Minh Highway. And the situation might get worse, as Typhoon Megi, also known as Typhoon Juan, barrels across the South China Sea after killing 11 people in the Philippines. Besides rain, the National Centre for Hydrometeorological Forecasting forecasts strong winds, big waves and rough seas over the next several days.","Landslides and flooding leave 46 dead, 21 missing in central Vietnam .

1029,"London (CNN) -- Buildings were burning at a prison in southern England on Saturday, more than 12 hours after prisoners started a riot by smashing windows and setting fires. Fires were burning in at least two buildings at HMP Ford, an open prison with numerous one-story residence halls on a grassy campus. At least one of the buildings was destroyed, according to aerial footage of the scene. Two fire engines escorted by specialist prison officers in riot gear went onto prison grounds Saturday afternoon as fires engulfed large parts of two more buildings, sending thick black smoke into the air. The Ministry of Justice said there were no reports of injuries to either prisoners or staff. The incident began around midnight (7 p.m. ET Friday) and forced prison staff to retreat. Police, firefighters and specialist teams of prison officers had to be called in. An additional 140 prison service staff arrived at Ford around midday Saturday to help bring the prison under full control, the Ministry of Justice said, emphasizing it was not an indication the situation was escalating. Ford is in a former Royal Navy station in Arundel, near the coast about two hours south of London. It was converted to a prison in 1960 and houses offenders who have fewer than two years left to serve on their sentences. Prisoners there are convicted of a variety of offenses, though the prison does not accept those convicted of arson, some sexual offenses and harassment.","Buildings are still burning 12 hours after the riot started .

1030,"(CNN) -- An Iowa community was shut down much of Sunday afternoon while emergency crews remained hard at work, sifting through wreckage caused by a wave of powerful tornadoes that swept across the state overnight. The twisters caused major damage to about 60% of Mapleton, a city of about 1,200 residents, Monona County Sheriff Jeff Pratt told reporters Sunday. It was all part of a violent storm system that struck overnight, originating in eastern Nebraska and following a warm front across northern Iowa, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Frank Boksa. But despite causing extensive damage, it did not lead to any fatalities, said Stefanie Bond, a spokeswoman for Iowa's Homeland Security & Emergency Management Division. Wildfires in Texas | Flooding in upper Midwest . Mapleton was among the hardest-hit areas. Initially, concerns about a gas leak had prompted all nonresidents to be barred from the community, which is about 45 miles southeast of Sioux City. By 5 p.m., people were being allowed back in, though authorities remained on the scene, according to the sheriff's department. The high winds tossed cars and tractors, tore off roofs, caused a car wash to collapse, uprooted trees and downed power lines. Yet Pratt said there had been only minor injuries, giving credit to advance warning as well as an emergency response effort that included authorities both local and from elsewhere. ""There was major devastation to the southwest portion of town, but no fatalities,"" the sheriff said. Iowa Gov. Terry E. Branstad issued a disaster proclamation for Monona County, according to a statement from his office. The proclamation allows officials to use state funds to help. He later issued a similar proclamation for Pocahontas County, which also suffered severe damage. He then toured the tornado-ravaged town on Sunday afternoon, posting pictures online of uprooted trees and conversations with residents. On his Twitter page, Branstad wrote, ""Please keep the victims in your thoughts and prayers."" The twisters struck just before midnight Saturday. Amateur video recorded by storm chasers shows a large funnel cloud spinning across a flat terrain outside Mapleton. In the background, a passenger can be heard exclaiming, ""It's going to hit that town! ... Mapleton's in big trouble!"" Did you witness the storm? Share your story . Afterward, National Guard troops were brought into the area, according to Stefanie Bond, a public information officer for the state's Homeland Security & Emergency Management Division. She also said that natural gas service was temporarily shut off in the city. The Red Cross was also on the ground providing assistance. Bruce Spence, a government liaison for the group, called the damage to the town ""extensive."" ""The whole town is without power. Main Street is a disaster,"" he told CNN. ""They've shut down the town. As we speak, I'm looking down one of the residential streets. There's debris all over, trees are down. ""This isn't going to get fixed soon,"" Spence said. The National Weather Service in Des Moines, Iowa, reported tornado sightings by storm chasers and trained spotters in as many as 11 towns and cities in northern and west-central Iowa over a four-hour period Saturday night. At least three of the twisters, including the Mapleton tornado, caused significant damage, according to Boksa. In Early, a town of 1,600 residents, a tornado ripped roofs off buildings and homes and uprooted large trees, authorities said. There were no reports of injuries in that town. In Schaller, a twister knocked down a dozen trees and felled multiple power poles, the weather service reported. Tammie Pech, a Red Cross spokeswoman, said the agency was opening shelters in Mapleton and Early to take in storm victims. Only four people slept in the Mapleton shelter overnight Sunday, Spence said. Most displaced residents opted to stay with family and friends, he said. The National Weather Service also reported major damage in Nemaha, possibly from a tornado. Bond noted that strong winds also tore through hog pens in Pocohontas Country, in central Iowa, and Kossuth County, in the east along the Illinois border. Three cities in Fayette County -- Fayette, Westgate and Maynard -- were without power for about an hour Sunday evening due to a blown transformer, the state's emergency management spokeswoman said. Randy Frank, Fayette County's homeland security and emergency management coordinator, said that the challenges continued well after the tornadoes came through, with sustained winds blowing at least 50 mph into Sunday evening. ""Our biggest problem right now is fuel fires out of control,"" said Frank, whose county is about 255 miles from Monona County. ""And it's that way across the state, with the wind, which (can) be very dangerous in (fanning) the fire."" CNN's Greg Morrison, Greg Botelho and Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.","NEW: A Fayette County official says fuel fires, fanned by strong winds, are a concern .

1031,"Ibadan, Nigeria (CNN) -- Separate bomb blasts ripped through a polling station and a collation center in northeastern Nigeria Saturday as Africa's most populous nation began voting in elections marred by violence and delays. The first explosion occurred at a voting station in the city of Maiduguri, National Emergency Management Agency spokesman Yushau Shuaib said. No deaths were reported; the number of injuries was still unknown. The second blast was also reported in Maiduguri, at the Abba Ganaram collation center, Shuaib said, adding that the explosion caused ""serious casualties."" It was not immediately clear how many people died. Also in Maiduguri, armed youths set a government building afire, Shuaib said. A new election chief promised ""free and fair"" elections this year, but the election has already been plagued by related bombings, assassinations and logistical problems that delayed the vote. Concerns are that continued violence could derail the vote altogether. Nigerians began voting Saturday for 360 House of Representatives seats and 109 Senate seats. The staggered voting structure will take them back to the polls next Saturday to vote for a president and on April 26 for a gubernatorial vote. Despite domestic and international pressure, Nigeria's Electoral Commission was forced to put off elections by a week after a nationwide logistical disaster -- many voting materials were not even in the country until voting day and party logos were missing from ballot papers. It was a huge setback, reminiscent of the problems of Nigeria's 2007 elections, described by the European Union as the worst it had seen anywhere in the world with rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. The legitimacy of the country now rides on the three rounds of polling. On the eve of the vote, a bomb exploded at the Independent National Electoral Commission office in Suleja in central Nigeria, officials said. A government official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told CNN that eight people died in the attack. Shuaib said more than seven people were seriously injured. ""We condemn this cowardly and dastardly action, which seems designed to instill fear in Nigerians and paralyze their aspirations for peaceful and credible elections,"" the chairman of the electoral commission, Attahiru Jega, said in a statement. ""Our deep sympathies go to the families of all these young Nigerians who lost their lives or were injured."" Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 85 people have been killed in political violence so far. As Africa's most populous country and its largest oil producer, Nigeria is important. Yet, despite its enormous oil wealth, 80% of the population lives on less than $2 a day, according to the United Nations. ""Make no mistake about it: This test of honour is inescapably a collective one for all Nigerians,"" the Independent National Electoral Commission said in a recent statement. ""It is our national honour at stake, and our relevance in the affairs of the modern world being redefined."" Separately on Friday, one man was killed and another seriously injured in a blast in the northern city of Kaduna, state news reported. Police rushed to the scene and found unexploded dynamite there, according to the Kaduna State Police Commissioner Haruna John, Voice of Nigeria reported. They found more dynamite at a house belonging to he injured man, the outlet said.","NEW: Separate blasts rock a voting and collation center .

1032,"(CNN) -- Shock and sadness etched the faces of residents in northeastern Wisconsin as daylight on Monday revealed the damage left behind by a powerful storm that cut a swath through the state. An emergency declaration has been made for the city of Kaukauna, where early estimates were that 157 homes had been either damaged or destroyed Sunday night, the city's police chief said. City officials, including the police, fire, planning and utility departments, went out in four teams for the morning assessment. ""This tornado, what we believe is a tornado, moved through, hit the back of houses, jumped over the front of those, then hit the front of the houses homes and hit the front of the houses on the other side of the street,"" said Kaukauna Police Chief John Manion. Despite the damage estimates, which officials believe will grow, no injuries were reported in Kaukauna from the storm. ""People were well warned,"" Manion said. ""That contributes to life."" Kaukauna is about 20 miles southwest of Green Bay. Authorities in Lincoln County, in northern Wisconsin, did a door-to-door search after the Sunday night storm. At least 25 homes suffered severe damage, said Mark Handlin of the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office. The worst damage was north of Merrill, about 170 miles north-northwest of Milwaukee, he said. Crews are working to clear downed trees and power lines, Handlin said. A shelter has been set up at a motel. Two residents were airlifted to a larger regional hospital because of the extent of their injuries, said Brian Sladek, director of Lincoln County emergency management. Other minor injuries were reported.","Daylight reveals extensive storm damage across Wisconsin .

1034,"Dallas (CNN) -- Once fearing one of the worst days in the state's history for battling wildfires, Texas firefighters got the upper hand Sunday on several blazes though others remained out of their control. The six new wildfires reported Sunday, all in different counties, were relatively small and quickly brought under control, the Texas Forest Service said in a statement. ""(Firefighters were) pretty lucky today,"" said Alan Craft, a spokesman for the state's Lone Star Incident Management Team. The most damage -- to an unoccupied mobile home, horse trailer and another building -- occurred over an acre in Newton County, but that fire was controlled. Eleven structures were threatened and one camper was lost over 129 acres in Angelina County, the state agency added. Still, despite successes in squelching these blazes, authorities were fighting to manage 19 other, appreciably bigger blazes. This challenge, as well as the weather outlook, had prompted the Forest Service to state that ""conditions on Sunday could shape up to be among the worst in Texas history."" Gov. Rick Perry renewed a disaster proclamation in effect for all of Texas' 249 counties -- even though major fires are occurring in 13 of them -- to expedite assistance in case of new fires, his office said Sunday in a statement. In addition to more than 750 personnel working with the Texas Forest Service, the governor's statement noted that two Blackhawk helicopters with the Texas Military Forces, bulldozers from the state transportation department and resources from 60 fire departments statewide were part of the effort. Authorities in the Lone Star state have responded to 6,831 fires over 643,000 acres since wildfire season began. The biggest fire still not under control was continuing Sunday in 71,000 acres in parts of Stonewall, Knox and King counties. Air resources, bulldozers, fire engines and other tools and personnel were being used in that fight, the Forest Service said. Another of the hardest slogs may be in Presidio County, where none of the 60,000 imperiled acres was considered to be contained Sunday. The Forest Service has deployed three air tankers, 60 firefighters, bulldozers and other equipment and personnel, in addition to a host of other state and local resources, focused on this blaze. Already, 30 to 40 homes in Fort Davis have been lost due to this fire, according to the Forest Service. Another 34 homes have burned in Midland County, due to a fire over 16,500 acres that the state agency on Sunday described as ""very active"" and not at all contained. A Red Cross shelter has been set up at Midland College for those displaced or otherwise affected by this wildfire. ""(Firefighters) can't outrun it,"" said Craft. There have been no evacuations yet related to another 60,000-acre blaze, this one in Potter and Moore counties near the city of Masterson. That fire is 50% contained and is still considered a threat to the towns of Dumas and Sunray. Texas is not alone, as wildfires are burning in large swaths of the Southwest and Midwest, fanned in part by dry, warm and windy conditions. The National Weather Service has issued ""red flag warnings"" through Sunday evening -- indicative of what it calls ""critical fire weather conditions"" -- in New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. But by Sunday night, such warnings were only in effect for parts of Texas and New Mexico. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin on Sunday extended a state of emergency for seven counties. The designation authorizes state agencies to make emergency purchases needed to quickly deliver resources to local jurisdictions, the state's emergency operations center said. The National Weather Service has posted fire warnings for the western two-thirds of the state. On Saturday, a grass fire burning just south of Cleveland, Oklahoma, prompted evacuations. As many as 70 firefighters were involved in the response, as well as three helicopters, said Terry Dennis, a spokesman with the Cleveland Fire Department. Twelve families checked into a Red Cross shelter, but more were evacuated, he said. Dennis said Saturday there had been no reports of injuries. In Texas, the fear is that relentless heavy winds and dry weather could spawn a rash of wildfires similar to those that swept across the southern plains states on April 9, 2009. Those fires scorched 147,924 acres, destroyed 111 homes and killed four people, the Texas Forest Service stated on its website. CNN's Stephanie Gallman, Mariano Castillo and Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","NEW: Firefighters were ""pretty lucky today,"" a state spokesman says .

1035,"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A Yemeni man injured in protests at Sanaa University died of his wounds early Wednesday morning, a medical official said. Mohamed Ali Mutlak, 24, was among dozens of anti-government demonstrators wounded Tuesday when security forces fired into the air and shot tear gas into a crowd of tens of thousands of protesters who had massed in front of Sanaa University, witnesses said. Eight of them were still in critical condition, said Dr. Waseem Qurashi, head of the medical department at Change Square, Sanaa University. According to witness Ala'a Al-Khowlani, at least 40 anti-government demonstrators were wounded and at least one of them was in critical condition. Other witnesses put the number of wounded as high as 67. Protests took place across the country Wednesday, witnesses said, but there was no word of violence. Tens of thousands of anti-government demonstrators were outside Sanaa University. In Taiz, tens of thousands of protesters continued their sit-in protest, calling for Saleh's ouster. Thousands were also in the streets of Ibb, Aden, Hodeidah, and Dhamar. However, the recent casualties drew condemnation. Amnesty International on Wednesday urged Yemeni authorities to ""end deadly night raids and other attacks on protests."" ""This is the second time in three weeks that protesters have been killed in late night raids by the security forces in the capital,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. ""These disturbing heavy-handed tactics used with lethal effect against protesters must stop immediately. People must be allowed to assemble and protest in peace."" Amnesty said about 30 people have reportedly been killed in Yemen in the ""ongoing unrest which began early last month."" Mohammed Abulahoum, a senior government official, Wednesday condemned ""the acts of violence used by the police and the military last night against civilian protesters outside the university. ""There was no need for that force. This will only escalate the tension between both sides,"" he added. He also rejected the official government explanation that tribesmen had tried to sneak arms into a no-weapons zone. ""They had no arms with them and they had no intention of using arms,"" Abulahoum charged,  saying he knows those tribesmen. Yaser Al-Hasani, one of the demonstrators, said security forces cracked down after students defied their orders not to take food and blankets into the protest area outside the gates of the university. The supplies were intended for the thousands of anti-government demonstrators who have camped out calling for Saleh to step down. In a statement e-mailed to reporters, the government blamed the violence on people who had tried to sneak weapons into a ""weapon-free area"" outside the university, then resisted arrest. ""The suspects resisted arrest and soon thereafter a gun fight broke out, injuring dozens of suspected militants, policemen and innocent bystanders,"" a government statement said. ""Panic from the shootings set off a raging stampede in the area. There is no official confirmation on casualties at this point."" The government said early Wednesday that the situation was under control and that the Interior Ministry would investigate the incident. Yemen's anti-government demonstrations are unfolding in a nation wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. High unemployment fuels much of the anger among a growing and impoverished young population. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom. Saleh, who has refused to step down, has said he will not run again for the presidency in the next election.

1036,"Washington (CNN) -- The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Tuesday that the situation in the wake of the Japanese nuclear reactor crisis is static but not yet stable. On the day that Japan bumped up the seriousness of its nuclear accident from a Level 5 to a Level 7 priority, on par with the Chernobyl disaster, a Senate committee heard from U.S. environmental officials, scientists and NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko. ""From the information we have, we believe the situation currently is static, namely we don't see significant changes on a day-to-day basis with the reactors,"" Jaczko told the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. ""It is not yet, however, what we believe to be stable: namely that given additional events or other circumstances ... there would not be the potential for significant additional problems at the reactors."" Thus, Jaczko said, the focus is ""on these efforts to transition from static to stable to ensure (the) long-term ... ability to cool the reactors and to provide cooling for the spent fuel pools."" California Sen. Barbara Boxer's state has a number of nuclear plants in areas with high seismic activity near millions of people. She pressed Jaczko for reassurances that enough is being done to protect people in the United States, especially California residents. ""We've got to move beyond talk and get to the serious question (of) what do we do, to do everything in our power to make it safe,"" Boxer said. Boxer pointed out that officials once said it was ""very unlikely"" Japan would ever face the kind of crisis it finds itself in today. Questions were raised at the hearing about how far to extend evacuation zones in the United States in the event of a nuclear incident. The NRC has recommended that Americans in Japan stay at least 50 miles away from the damaged reactors. The current standard in the United States is a 10-mile evacuation zone. ""As we've seen in Japan, nuclear events tend to develop over a long period of time,"" said Jaczko. ""This is three weeks into this event, and we've had the time and the ability to make protective action recommendations, and to update and modify them as conditions of the plant changed. So that 10 miles is really based around the idea of what do you need to have prepared right away so that if you have an event that develops quickly, you can address that and have prestaged and prepared what to do,"" he said. Boxer pointed out that two of the nuclear plants in California were built to withstand a certain level of earthquake, pointing out in Japan it was 7.5 but the devastating quake was much more powerful. She said nuclear regulatory officials are being too conservative. ""It's eerie to me, because I don't sense enough humility from all of us here. You know, as some great scientists once said, we think we have all the answers, but Mother Nature may not agree with us. So a lot of what you're saying is the same thing that they said,"" Boxer pointed out. ""You can't know for sure what's going to happen,"" she said. Lisa Jackson, administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, reassured senators that air and water sampling for radiation contamination continue in the United States and that so far there is nothing to worry about. ""Let me be clear, EPA has not seen and does not expect to see radiation in our air or water reaching harmful levels in the United States,"" said Jackson. ""All of the data that we have seen, which we continue to make public and available on our website, indicates that while radiation levels are slightly elevated in some places, they are significantly below problematic levels.""","NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko speaks to members of Senate public works panel .

1037,"Ofunato, Japan (CNN) -- More than a month after the devastating tsunami and earthquake that flattened seaside communities across northern Japan, many aid groups are wrapping up operations. One team of volunteers is just ramping up, however. For those wondering what they can still do to help, the U.S.-based charity All Hands has an answer: Buy a plane ticket, and come ready to get to work. ""What we do is come in after natural disasters all around the world and help people by bringing in volunteers in the recovery process,"" said Marc Young, the charity's operational director in Ofunato, a small port city on Japan's northeastern coast. Ofunato was swamped in the tsunami that left nearly 500 dead and missing. The survivors are now faced with a mountain of debris to clear and a need to find new homes for more than 6,500 people. By Monday, the U.S.-based secular nonprofit had 23 volunteers from the United States, Canada, Britain and Australia working alongside Japanese from across the country. They were cleaning out houses and businesses and helping people salvage any personal goods and gear they could. Chris Turner, a staff project coordinator for All Hands, just arrived from working in Leogane, Haiti. Unlike Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Japan is the world's third-largest economy and its government is functioning. Help is still needed, however. ""Some people, what they most like to donate is their hard work,"" says Turner, a Canadian. ""We kind of give people that opportunity."" The group is staying at a nearby house donated by a local resident and are getting a campground up and running to service the expected 100 volunteers who are streaming in every day. All Hands also is setting up a ""smart distribution"" warehouse to better allocate donated goods to the people who need them. In the immediate aftermath of the quake, truckloads of donated food, clothes and household goods were sent in. Now there are huge pallets of toilet paper, plates and other scattered goods from people who were well-meaning, but unclear on what was needed. ""We think that there is enough shampoo and detergent here for every person in every shelter to use a bottle a day for a year,"" Young said. There are few baths or working washing machines in the area, and what people really need is fresh food, he said. Most people have temporary shelter, and All Hands is forming a partnership with Habitat for Humanity to build 50 new homes. The group also is working with local leaders to team volunteers with Japanese carpenters to pull out waterlogged floors and walls from homes that are otherwise structurally sound. ""It's rewarding to get all the debris out of the homes,"" Young said. ""But it's especially exciting to take the next step and get people back in to their own homes."" The group members are from all over the world, but All Hands says they had to pick the first volunteers from among thousands of offers based on skills they could contribute. Amya Miller, a volunteer from Boston, was born and raised in Japan, and now works as an interpreter. Miller said she her family and business on hold for two months to come and help in Japan and called in every favor she was ever owed to raise money. ""You can't forget about these people,"" she said. ""This is a multi-year recovery process.""","All Hands cleans houses and helps families salvage posessions .

1038,"(CNN) -- The 8.9-magnitude earthquake and coastline-devouring tsunami that hit Japan has led 49 countries, the European Union and even the International Atomic Energy Agency to band together and offer relief to the devastated island nation. With Japan's death toll at 686 people, the international relief effort has been spurred by the stark, globally televised videos of homes and offices rattled to near collapse and entire waterfront communities being washed away by a rising ocean. The international community's assistance complemented the United States' expansive relief mission, which includes supplies, several warships, search-and-rescue teams, radiation-contamination specialists, and two officials from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission with expertise in boiling water nuclear reactors. On Sunday, the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan arrived off the coast of Honshu to support Japanese forces in disaster relief operations, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement. Also Sunday, the Chinese government sent a 15-member team to assist in the search for survivors, Xinhua News Agency reported. The team brought with them four tons of equipment and material for the search as well to provide power and telecommunications to areas that have temporarily lost those services because of the quake. In addressing one of the bigger potential threats, the international atomic agency's Incident and Emergency Centre has offered technical assistance to Japan in the wake of an explosion at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. An evacuation order for a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) radius around the plant is affecting tens of thousands of people. On Saturday, the United Kingdom said it was sending a team of 59 fire service search-and-rescue specialists, two rescue dogs and a medical support team, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. With a scheduled arrival on Sunday, the crew will immediately join the international search for survivors in shattered and inundated communities, the British office said. The teams will take up to 11 tonnes of rescue equipment, including heavy lifting and cutting equipment to extract people trapped in debris, the government said. The UK foreign office also dispatched a 10-member consular response team, including British Red Cross workers, to Japan on Saturday morning, the government said. South Korea is sending two rescue dogs, two handlers and three assistants to carry out what are expected to be dramatic searches of people inside collapsed structures. The rescue teams were scheduled to arrive Saturday, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a written statement. In China, Premier Wen Jiabao, who expressed ""deep sympathy"" to the Japanese government and people, made a formal offer of assistance. Members of the country's international rescue team were ready to depart for Japan if needed, Chen Jianmin, director of the China Earthquake Administration, told the government's Xinhua News Agency. The United States is providing as many 11 warships, with their helicopters, to assist Japanese authorities in rescue and recovery missions. The U.S. Agency for International Development was dispatching two urban search-and-rescue teams, one from Fairfax County, Virginia, and the second from Los Angeles County -- totaling 150 people and 12 canines trained to find survivors. They are scheduled to arrive Monday morning in Japan.

1039,"(CNN) -- Heavy rains that began early in January in northern central Namibia have reached staggering proportions, with 80 people drowned and half a million others affected directly or indirectly, officials said. President Hifikepunye Pohamba declared a national emergency in all six northern regions on March 28. The affected region is in the Cuvelai Basin, which drains southern Angola via a complex of streams that typically result in an annual flood called the efundja, which is named for the fish that spawn in spring. This year's efundja has resulted in the wettest year since systematic measurements started in 1891, with rainfall in affected areas nearly double the normal average. Government figures cite 263 school closures, with a total of 320 affected, leaving 114,000 schoolchildren shut out of their classrooms. Up to 40 health clinics are under water, and more than 100 health mobile outreach points have been made inaccessible as a result of damage to roads and bridges, according to the World Health Organization. In addition, roads, bridges, homes and staple crops in all six northern and northeastern regions in Namibia have been destroyed, according to UNICEF. They represent some of the country's poorest areas. The Red Cross Society of Namibia estimates that 500,000 people have been affected, with the densely populated central-northern regions -- Omusati, Oshona and Ohangwena -- hit worst. But other areas are also threatened, as rivers -- including the Zambezi -- drain southern and central Angola. Forecasters predict areas like Caprivi, which is about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east, may experience more flooding by next week. About 40,000 people have been displaced, some 10,000 of whom have been accommodated in 68 camps set up by the government, officials said. The death toll is expected to rise as water-borne diseases, mainly malaria, are predicted to spread. The Red Cross and the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs are appealing for help, and the U.S. government and some European countries have made donations. OCHA said in its southern Africa flood and cyclone report, published Wednesday, that 2011 marks the third consecutive year of heavy rains in the region. The result is that the water table has risen and that ""flood water levels are unlikely to recede for the next three to six months."" More rain is expected.

1040,"(CNN) -- Faced with some of driest conditions Texas has seen in nearly a century, firefighters around the state are struggling to fight off what a forest service official on Sunday called the ""perfect storm for wildfires."" April Saginor, a spokeswoman with the Texas Forest Service, said crews were having difficulty getting hundreds of blazes under control due to a rare combination of strong winds, unseasonably warm temperatures and low humidity. Conditions this spring are the driest they've been in Texas since 1917, she claimed. Authorities have responded to 7,807 fires across more than 1.5 million acres since this year's wildfire season began, Gov. Rick Perry wrote in a letter late Saturday to President Barack Obama requesting that the federal government declare Texas a disaster area. These have affected all but two of the state's 254 counties. On Sunday, some 1,300 personnel representing 34 states were on the front lines battling these fires. And, unless there is a drastic and sustained change in conditions, Saginor said she expects the fight to continue for several months more. ""We're looking at this as a marathon, not a sprint,"" she said. ""We're very committed to this."" To that end, Perry's request to federal authorities -- which he made late Saturday and announced Sunday -- was an attempt to expedite federal assistance. ""I have determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments, and that supplementary federal assistance is necessary,"" the governor wrote in his letter to Obama, sent through a Texas-based Federal Emergency Management Agency official. Saginor noted that rural areas and more populated areas like Austin have been affected -- though she added that there have been no civilian casualties and problems with numerous evacuations that have taken place. The governor noted that one firefighter has died and 18 others have been injured, while 244 homes have been destroyed and another 8,514 threatened residences ""saved."" ""The wildland fire risk potential has reached a critically high level,"" Perry said. These conditions ""present a serious hazard to the lives and property of the citizens of the state."" New and evolving wildfires prompted three sets of evacuations Sunday, all while crews tried to prevent further damage all around the state. The Texas Forest Service announced in a statement that, as of 2:15 p.m. Sunday, people were being ordered to evacuate from Strawn and other parts of Palo Pinto County and Caddo in Stephens County. Strawn's population of 764, the forest agency said, is endangered by a fire fanned by strong winds and fueled by ""extremely dry"" conditions in north central Texas. People in other parts of Palo Pinto County, including those in about 300 homes and a campground in the Peninsula on Possum Kingdom Lake, have also been told to leave. Saginor explained that these actions are part of a trio of nearby fires that, collectively, have burned 55,000 acres. Numerous resources -- including three helitankers (helicopters that dump water), two Blackhawk helicopters and three 20-man crews -- have been brought in, she said. A 2,200-acre fire imperiled Caddo, where 40 people lived in 2000, according to the Texas State Historical Society. Two hours later, the forest service noted that evacuations were ""in progress"" in Travis County, home of the state capital of Austin. That fire, while smaller than many others at 60 acres, raised alarms as it crept near 100 homes, 10 businesses and Austin Community College. The forest service update, posted online at 4:19 p.m. Sunday, said ""extreme fire behavior is being exhibited,"" though no additional information was immediately available. Mother Nature didn't appear to be doing firefighters any favors. Sustained winds in many locales were blowing 20 to 25 mph from the south this weekend, and gusting even stronger. And the long-term forecast didn't look much better. The forecast in Palo Pinto County for instance, called for high temperatures in the mid-90s through Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. In Austin, temperatures are expected to hit or surpass 90 all week. ""With the winds that we've got today, it's hard to be aggressive with any suppression activities; it's just too dangerous to get in front of that type of fire,"" Texas Forest Service spokesman Marq Webb told CNN affiliate WFAA. ""The fires we're experiencing in some cases are moving four or five miles an hour. That's the length of a football field every minute."" As of Saturday, Texas Forest Service personnel were responding to at least 14,758 acres of new fires -- five of them major -- that broke out during the day. A blend of potent winds, dense growth of flammable material and low humidity have made this a challenging season for firefighters in the state, with 195 Texas counties banning any burning in a bid to prevent more blazes. The biggest of the new fires Saturday was in Jack County, where more than 150 homes were threatened and ultimately saved in the town of Bryson, according to the forest service. That 7,500-acre fire was 40% contained as of 11 a.m. Sunday. A 1,440-acre fire in Trinity County burning in mostly pine forest 20 miles northwest of Livingston and 800 acres that imperiled 40 homes in Tyler County some 10 miles northeast of Kountze were both 50% contained. Two Blackhawk helicopters, from the National Guard, were called in to assist with the latter blaze, the Texas Forest Service said. Some 1,850 acres in Cisco were threatened by a new 1,400-acre fire in Eastland County that was 75% contained, and forces had batted down an even higher percentage of the 2,000-acre blaze burning in Young County, six miles northeast of Graham. All these blazes paled in size to several others elsewhere in Texas. The biggest this season has been the so-called Rockhouse fire that spanned more than 182,000 acres in Presidio and Jeff Davis counties. That blaze, which destroyed 23 homes and two businesses, is 70% contained. In Coke County, north of San Angelo, crews had only managed to contain 10% of 130,000 acres of what's being called the Wildcat fire. The Texas Forest Service said late Sunday afternoon that this blaze was moving north and northwest, making it a threat to the county seat of Robert Lee and its 1,171 residents. New resources were brought in this weekend to fight this fire, with the state agency saying crews planned to approach it from the south. Another major wildfire centered in Cooper Mountain Ranch -- spanning 152,000 acres in Kent, Stonewall and Fisher counties -- was half-contained as of Sunday morning, with shifting winds the previous day pushing the flames toward Camp Springs. CNN's Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","NEW: A forest service spokeswoman says conditions are the driest since 1917 .

1041,"Washington (CNN) -- A plane carrying Michelle Obama had to abort its landing on Monday after it came too close to a military C-17 cargo plane ahead of it, according to a senior administration official and the Federal Aviation Administration. The planes -- which were both trying to land -- were three miles apart, when they are supposed to be five miles apart, the official told CNN. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating what went wrong, as it is believed to be an air traffic controller mistake, the official said. The White House does not believe the first lady's life was ever in danger, the senior official said. The FAA said in a statement controllers at Andrews Air Force Base instructed an incoming Boeing 737 to perform a ""go around"" ""because the plane did not have the required amount of separation"" behind the military plane. Air traffic controller caught watching movie on duty . The FAA is investigating. ""The aircraft were never in any danger,"" the agency said. The landing was briefly aborted and Obama's plane had to circle, the official said. Obama was actually on a C-40, a military version of the 737 that was part of the Air National Guard -- not the regular Air Force fleet used by VIPs at Andrews, said Maj. Michelle Lai of the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base. What it's like to be an air traffic controller . The FAA did not want Obama's plane to be caught in the ""jet wash,"" of the C-17 as it landed, Lai said. That refers to the force of the air from the back of the C-17. ""It's important to know the FAA made the right call and at no time was the first lady's life in danger,"" Lai said. When the Potomac TRACON, the regional radar facility, handed off the plane to the Andrews Air Force Base tower, the planes were three miles apart, a government official told CNN. ""Both facilities knew how far apart they were"" at the time of the handoff, the official said. But the official declined to say why the hand-off occurred. Plane clipped by tractor-trailer at Boston airport . The TRACON could have slowed Obama's plane down or order it to turn earlier, the official said. Why that wasn't done is under investigation. But ""it was a controlled situation,"" the government official said. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was gathering information on the incident and will be making an assessment to determine whether it will investigate more closely. CNN's Ed Henry, Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","The FAA says the aircraft were never in any danger .

1042,"(CNN) -- For some survivors of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, escaping the inferno of the doomed rig made them feel like they'd cheated death. But living with the scars of what they witnessed that night, and the memory of the 11 men who perished when the rig exploded off the coast of Louisiana a year ago, has in many ways taken their lives away. ""I remember feeling invincible when it first happened. I remember driving in my truck on the way home after the rig exploded and (I) pushed the gas (pedal) to the floor and never let off it,"" says Daniel Barron. But the high Barron felt from surviving didn't last long. ""You have that guilty conscience of, 'Okay, I made it, that's great, but then these guys didn't.' Was there something I could have done to save more people?"" Barron says his guilt is compounded by physical and mental issues that are a result of the disaster. He suffers from memory loss, and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, according to medical records provided to CNN. He witnessed one of his good friends, whom he calls a ""fallen brother,"" die right in front of him when a second explosion rocked the rig. ""It literally picked him up . . . like a child would throw a toy . . . and he ended up bouncing off of the pedestal for the crane,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper shortly after the disaster. ""Just to see him get blown up like that, I mean, it was, it's heart-wrenching,"" Barron said. Barron says one night, the psychological pain and the guilt of surviving when so many friends did not, became overwhelming. ""I had a 6-shot pistol and I just wanted it to be over,"" he says. His wife discovered him playing Russian roulette and persuaded him to hand over the gun before it was too late. Douglas Brown, one of Barron's fellow survivors, also speaks of the guilt of surviving the disaster. ""I am thankful that I, I made it out alive but a lot of times, I don't -- there's a lot of times where I feel I should, I should have died there too, along with my friends,"" Brown said. Like Barron, Brown has been diagnosed with multiple mental issues including PTSD, traumatic brain injury, depression and anxiety, according to medical records. A third survivor, Matthew Jacobs, says he thinks of the 11 victims of the Deepwater Horizon every day and wakes up screaming from nightmares where he's re-living the explosions. ""It's something that I just can't quit, you know, get out of my head,"" he says. Jacobs first told the story of his harrowing escape to Cooper in the weeks after the disaster. He expected to die as his lifeboat, which was being lowered 75 feet down from the rig, was filling with smoke and started to free-fall after another explosion. ""I prayed for my family to let God know that I love my wife and that I love my kids,"" he said. In the year since, Jacobs and his wife have started divorce proceedings because of his mental issues including, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, he says. Those mental issues are also corroborated by medical records provided to CNN. All three survivors say their physical and mental injuries have left them unable to work and they're suing their employer Transocean for lost wages and pain and suffering. While technically still employees, they have not set foot on a rig since the disaster and their employer stopped paying their salaries last December. They accuse Transocean of valuing profits over safety prior to the accident, and of valuing minimizing monetary losses over the welfare of its employees after it. In a statement, Transocean responded to their allegations writing: ""From the first hours, Transocean has focused on providing support for its employees and the families of those who were lost aboard the Deepwater Horizon, including continued full pay and benefits for eight months following the incident and professional counseling for those in need. Today, more than one third of the Deepwater Horizon crew are back to work at Transocean and the entire company continues to be inspired by their courage and commitment."" Transocean still pays for some of the three survivors' health care costs and gives them a small monthly stipend for room and board as required by law. The survivors were offered an additional six months of pay to drop any claims, but they declined, according to legal records provided to CNN. On the anniversary of the disaster, the survivors say they hope to one day put the accident behind them but also hope people never forget the 11 men who died that night on the Deepwater Horizon. ""I would ask people just to remember them and pray for their families, because I know those families are still suffering,"" Brown says. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

1043,"Tokyo (CNN) -- It's billed as ""the happiest place on Earth."" And Friday, Disneyland's Tokyo theme park reopened in hopes of bringing some of that missing happiness back to the Japanese people. The park has been closed since the March 11 earthquake that devastated northern Japan and the electricity shortage that followed. Disney fans lined up as early as 6:30 a.m., an hour and a half before Friday's reopening, hoping to be the first into the park. Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Goofy, and a host of other Disney characters surprised visitors as the gates opened at 8 a.m. A sort of Disney hysteria swept over the crowd as Mickey danced in front of visitors minutes before the official opening of the park. ""We were so excited, we were almost crying,"" Tokyo Disneyland visitor Mika Hasegawa said. The re-opening comes at a critical time for Japan, as the country struggles to regain some semblance of normalcy after the earthquake and tsunami that killed 13,500 people in the country's northeast. Many Tokyo residents have refrained from excessive celebrations and parties out of respect for the victims. But Disneyland visitor Minako Ootsuka said that while Japanese people should be mindful of the disaster, it's also important to have a good time and release stress. Hiroshi Suzuki, public relations manager for Oriental Land Co. -- the company that owns Tokyo Disneyland -- agreed. He said visitors were so elated when they saw Mickey and the other characters, he wished he could bring that kind of happiness to all people in Japan. Other visitors to the park said they thought it was important to start getting out and spending money to get the economy running again. Erika Kanehira said she planned on visiting Tokyo Disneyland as often as she could and would also purchase merchandise to help the disaster area recover. For every guest admitted to the park through May 14, Tokyo Disneyland will donate 300 yen (about $4) to the Japanese Red Cross. The park will also be operating under shortened business hours in order to save power. Suzuki says the company hopes to get the park up and running on usual business hours as soon as possible. But most visitors are happy to have the park back at all. Tomomi Takehashi said Disneyland was a place where people can come to laugh and smile -- and that may be exactly what the Japanese public needs right now.","""We were so excited, we were almost crying,"" a park visitors says .

1044,"Washington (CNN) -- Humanitarian assistance from the United States began its journey to Japan Friday, as President Barack Obama extended a helping hand to the nation after it was hit by a devastating 8.9-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami. There are eight warships either near Japan or headed for it. All are attached to the U.S. 7th Fleet, which is headquartered in Yokosuka, Japan. Navy personnel began loading tons of disaster relief supplies aboard the U.S. 7th Fleet command flagship, the USS Blue Ridge, currently in Singapore The vessel and its crew were scheduled to depart for Japan Saturday morning, according to a statement from U.S. 7th Fleet public affairs. The USS Essex was scheduled to leave Malaysia Friday evening carrying about 2,000 Marines from the 31st Marine Expeditionary movement. The USS Harpers Ferry and the USS Germantown are en route to Japan from the Philippine Sea. The USS Ronald Reagan, a nuclear-powered carrier, has been pulled from a long-planned exercise off the Korean Peninsula and is now headed for the earthquake area, accompanied by USS Chancellorsville and the USS Preble. And the USS Tortuga has left its base at Sasebo, a port city in far southern Japan. The ship already has several landing craft on board, but it's heading to South Korea to take delivery of MH-53 cargo helicopters, which it will then carry to Japan. In addition to the 7th Fleet ships that have already received orders to head to the island nation, all ships in the fleet that can carry helicopters or aircraft have been ordered to be ready to deploy within 24 hours, if necessary. Fleet vessels not designed to carry aircraft must be able to deploy within 48 hours. The fleet is also undertaking a full accounting of all personnel in Japan, as well as the condition of their family members. However, no reports of injuries among 7th Fleet personnel have been received and no major damage has been reported among fleet assets, according to the public affairs statement. The public affairs statement pointed out that the 7th Fleet is not conducting full-scale disaster response operations, which would only come after a formal request from the Japanese government. It's not just the military that is taking steps to get help to victims of Friday's earthquake. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and its partner agencies are on standby in case their assistance is needed, the agency said in a news release. In addition, six Los Angeles County canine disaster search teams have been activated. The dogs were trained by the Search Dog Foundation and are now getting health clearance from their veterinarians to ensure they are ready to deploy. They will be part of a Los Angeles task force mobilized along with one from Virginia by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Each team will come with more than 70 personnel and approximately 75 tons of search and rescue equipment, in addition to the search and rescue dogs. ""On behalf of the American people, I wish to convey our sympathy, thoughts and prayers to the people of Japan who have been affected by this devastating earthquake and tsunami,"" said Rajiv Shah, the administrator for USAID, in a written statement. ""We are working with the government of Japan to provide any assistance needed in the rescue effort as quickly as possible."" The agency also is dispatching a disaster assistance response team. California Gov. Jerry Brown said in a news release that he has ""directed California's Emergency Management Agency to make state resources available to the Japanese government."" Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig even promised assistance from Major League Baseball. Citing ""our shared love of baseball for more than a century,"" Selig said in a statement that Japan is ""a particularly special place to us"" and that MLB will provide aid in the coming days and weeks. The American Red Cross is communicating with the Japanese Red Cross Society and its global partners, according to a statement from the agency. So far, the American Red Cross has not received any requests for blood from its Japanese counterparts, or from the U.S. or Japanese governments. The organization is encouraging people with loved ones in Japan to use the Red Cross ""Safe and Well"" website, an online tool which helps families connect during natural disasters and emergencies. Earlier in the day, Obama described his country's assistance priorities at a news conference. ""I offer our Japanese friends whatever assistance is needed,"" he said. ""Today's events remind us how fragile life can be."" He said the main U.S. assistance to Japan would probably be ""lift capacity"" in the form of heavy equipment to help clean up damaged infrastructure. The U.S. government is taking inventory of how many military personnel are in Japan to provide help, he said, adding that American citizens in Japan will also receive assistance. Obama called the earthquake and tsunami ""a potentially catastrophic disaster,"" saying the images of destruction were ""simply heartbreaking."" At a session of the President's Export Council on Friday morning at the Old Executive Office Building, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged ""immediate disaster relief assistance"" and said, ""We are working closely with the government of Japan to provide additional help,"" according to a State Department statement. The State Department on Friday said there were no immediate reports of casualties among the tens of thousands of U.S. citizens -- tourists, military personnel and others -- in Japan. The State Department issued an alert against nonessential travel to Japan because of the earthquake and tsunami. The alert said that Tokyo airports were closed and others also may be closed or restricted, and that public transportation in Tokyo and other areas has been interrupted. The alert also said strong aftershocks are likely ""for weeks"" and included instructions for what to do if caught in an earthquake or aftershock. It urged U.S. citizens in Japan to contact family and friends to let them know of their well-being. American Airlines told CNN that it would resume flights into Japan on Saturday. Both American and Delta Airlines canceled flights into Tokyo Friday. It was unclear if flights to other Japanese airports also were affected. In addition, Delta, United and Continental airlines announced they were waiving change fees for people whose travel plans involving Japan were affected by the disaster. The Yokota Air Base, a U.S. Air Force facility in Japan, accommodated 11 commercial planes carrying more than 500 passengers, after the flights were diverted to the base when the earthquake closed Tokyo's Narita International Airport, according to a news release from the Air Force's 374th Airlift Wing. Volunteers from various organizations brought food, water and cots for the stranded passengers and helped them register with the Red Cross. At the State Department, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Janice Jacobs said a 24-hour consular task force has been set up to help Americans affected by the earthquake. Americans in Japan who need help, or people seeking information about a loved one in Japan, can send an e-mail to japanemergencyusc@state.gov, Jacobs said. Americans outside Japan but in tsunami-affected areas who need help, or people seeking information about an American in affected areas outside Japan, can e-mail pacifictsunamiusc@state.gov, she said. A telephone information line also has been set up at 1-888-407-4747, said Jacobs, who encouraged people to use the e-mail options if possible. When seeking information about Americans in Japan or other affected areas, Jacobs said, people should provide the full name, birth date and location of the person, as well as any pre-existing medical conditions, and if they are elderly or a child.

1045,"(CNN) -- A rural Pennsylvania community will say goodbye Tuesday to seven children who were killed when their parent's farmhouse went up in flames last week. The children -- ages 7 months to 11 years -- died March 8 when the fire fully engulfed the Mennonite family's two-story house in Loysville, about 25 miles northwest of Harrisburg. Their parents were both outside the house at the time of the fire. Mother Janelle Clouse was milking cows in the barn and father Ted Clouse was making deliveries on his milk route. ""While mom's milking cows, her 3-year-old daughter comes running into the barn and the 3-year-old tells the mother that there's smoke inside the house,"" Tom Pinkerton of the state police said last week. ""Mom leaves the barn, comes running out, sees that the house appears to be on fire."" The mother went to two neighbors' houses before she could get someone to call 911, he said. She then found her husband sleeping in his milk truck and they rushed back to the home to find their home engulfed in flames and firefighters trying to put out the blaze. The children -- six girls and a boy -- were found dead inside the house. The 3-year-old was the only child who survived. The funeral is scheduled for the Perry Mennonite Reception Center in Elliottsburg. Burial will be at the Church of the Living Christ cemetery. The fire sent shock waves through the central Pennsylvania community. ""It's just hard to explain how somebody could lose their whole family in a wink of an eye like that,"" Steve Orris, who works at an insurance company in Loysville, said last week. ""It's just unbelievable."" ""Everybody I've talked to here ... has felt a lot of sympathy toward these people. It's a real shame the way things like that happen,"" he said.","The funeral is scheduled for the Perry Mennonite Reception Center in Elliottsburg .

1047,"Dallas (CNN) -- Wildfires that have raged through parts of Texas have killed a second firefighter. Elias Jaquez, 49, died Wednesday, 11 days after getting trapped in a fire and suffering burns, Cactus City Manager Steve Schmidt-Witcher said Thursday. ""We're a very small, tight-knit community.  Everybody knew Elias, knew his family,"" Schmidt-Witcher said.  ""It's having a definite impact."" Firefighter Greg Simmons died last Friday trying to extinguish the East Sidwynicks fire in Eastland County. Numerous firefighters have been injured, some seriously. Thousands of firefighters have been battling the blazes that have scorched more than a million acres in Texas since April 6. Dry, windy conditions remained in parts of Texas on Thursday, though in some areas, cooler temperatures and rain aided firefighters. ""We've been given a break in the weather,"" said April Saginor, spokeswoman for the Texas Forest Service.  ""Humidity is up and temperatures are down."" CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said thunderstorms are expected in the region this weekend, but they will drop little rain and the lightning could spark further wildfires. West Texas averages nearly 15 inches of rain a year, according to David Hennig, a meteorologist in Midland, Texas.  Over the past six months, just 13-hundredths of an inch of rain have been recorded in that part of the state. While October through March is typically the dry season, that amount of rainfall is far below what it should be, Hennig said. Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer predicted the fires will long be remembered. ""This is an event that's going to mark time in our county's history,"" he said. ""It's something that's going to change forever the looks and the community itself. It will be life before the fire and life after the fire, it's that big a deal."" On Thursday, Gov. Rick Perry declared Friday through Sunday as Days of Prayer for Rain. He urged ""Texans of all faiths and religious traditions"" to pray for ""an end to this ongoing drought and these devastating wildfires,"" as well as the safety of firefighters, said a news release from his office. The tinder-dry landscape has provided no shortage of fuel:  On Thursday, the Texas Forest Service responded to seven new fires across 159 acres; Wednesday's four new fires covered more than 1,000 acres; Tuesday;s 10 new fires totaled more than 2,000 acres. Since January 1, the Texas Forest Service said, it has responded to more than 800 fires that have damaged some 5,000 structures across 1.4 million acres. The state has seen fires in 252 of its 254 counties since December 21, 2010. In addition to in-state crews, the Texas Forest Service is directing the efforts of more than 1,900 firefighters from 36 states.  That figure does not include volunteer fire department responders. Schmidt-Witcher with the city of Cactus said he has lived in Moore County for 16 years and never seen fires this bad. Jaquez was among the personnel fighting a brush fire south of Dumas on April 9 when two fire trucks got stuck.  The four firefighters abandoned their trucks and tried to run from the fire.  Three suffered smoke inhalation.  Jaquez was unable to get away and was burned. He was taken to a burn unit in Lubbock, Texas, but died Wednesday, leaving a wife and four daughters. Flags were flown at half-staff, Schmidt-Witcher said.

1048,"Minamisoma, Japan (CNN) -- The scene of sheer devastation left by powerful tsunami waves looked sadly familiar: trucks slammed into houses, uprooted trees and downed power lines soaked in muddy water, while time stood still inside abandoned homes with unmade beds and scattered stuffed toys. It was the eerie combination of sounds that stood out as I surveyed a deserted village on this chilly Wednesday morning: Rustling of dangling tin sheets in gusty wind, my own breathing behind a face mask and the constant beeping of my Geiger counter. My colleagues and I had just entered the 20-kilometer exclusion zone, a radius Japanese authorities drew around the Fukushima Daiichi power plant and ordered some 78,000 residents evacuated in the early days of the crisis, now the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. The March 11 twin disasters of a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and the ensuing tsunami in northeastern Japan have resulted in the plant belching radioactive particles into the surrounding environment. Driving for two hours on winding highways from the Fukushima train station, we had passed through rural Japan's alternating scenes of snow-covered mountains and green valleys in full bloom -- until we reached a checkpoint with a big ""no-entry"" sign and flashing red lights. A friendly police officer, however, waved us through, after emphasizing the need to don face masks despite the relatively low reading on radiation. Our shoes tightly wrapped in paper booties, we finally stepped onto the soil inside the so-called hot zone, some 18 kilometers north of the stricken nuclear plant. With parts of the ground still wet from days of rain, we avoided murky puddles to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. The numbers on our Geiger counters fluctuated while the alarms -- with base level set low -- kept going off. Still, we faced no danger of being exposed to anything that would harm human health. Cars zipped by occasionally as residents were allowed in to check on homes and businesses, but the only other sign of life appeared to be farm animals -- a few cows, horses and chickens -- left behind that have grown gaunt. We noticed a lone young man in a blue jacket and jeans standing by a large pool of muddy water. Declining to reveal his name, the 34-year-old farmer told us, before the tsunami hit, the pool was a fertile rice field that his family had tilled for 150 years. ""I have lost my work and my home,"" he said, adding he had come back to retrieve some personal belongings. ""And I am scared about my health."" He said he doesn't trust government officials who say risks from radiation are low for local residents. His father wants to return, but he has other plans for the future. ""I may have to face the prospect of leaving my father behind and live faraway from here to start a family,"" he said. We wished the young farmer good luck and didn't linger long inside the exclusion zone as it started drizzling from the gloomy sky. As we exited the checkpoint, a news headline flashed on my phone: ""Japan to enforce nuclear evacuation zone."" After removing face masks and paper booties, we drove past a line of shuttered storefronts and stopped at the centuries-old Senryu temple just outside the 20-kilometer perimeter. Sweeping its immaculately kept ground -- complete with a sand garden and a fish pond -- was Shinkoh Ishikawa, a 58-year-old Buddhist monk who offers a rare sanctuary to a community ravaged by a succession of disasters. The government had advised residents between the 20- and 30-kilometer zones to move away or remain indoors. ""Religion is not something distant, it stays next to you,"" Ishikawa explained his decision to stay after seeing hundreds of bodies of tsunami victims cremated at the local funeral home without a proper Buddhist ritual. ""I hope people understand that death is not the end of one's life, but a revolving step where lives meet again."" Lighting a candle in the temple's main hall where eight boxes of cremated remains lay on a table, Ishikawa chanted prayers for the dead. But it's the tough and cheerful nature of the locals, he said, that has given him the best hope even as the nuclear fallout continues to unfold. ""We will rebuild,"" he said. ""I'm confident about that because we had done the same after the second world war.""","There is a 20-kilometer exclusion zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility .

1049,"New York (CNN) -- A Broadway actor injured when he fell more than 20 feet while performing a stunt in the ""Spider-Man"" musical is set to be released from a rehabilitation center this week, his father told CNN Sunday. Christopher Tierney, 31, was moved into the center after being discharged from New York's Bellevue Hospital on December 28. His father, Tim Tierney, said he isn't sure when his son will arrive at his Portsmouth, New Hampshire, home, but said he is scheduled to be released from the facility Wednesday. Christopher Tierney suffered four broken ribs; a hairline skull fracture; a broken scapula, or shoulder blade; a bruised lung; three cracked vertebrae; and broken bones below his elbow in the December 20 fall, the elder Tierney has said. Tim Tierney said his son is improving. ""He is up,"" he said. ""He is walking and just doing very well."" He said Christopher Tierney cannot wait to return to the show, ""Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark."" Several of the shows were canceled following Tierney's fall, and new safety precautions were put in place before they resumed following a meeting between the show's company, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York State Department of Labor. The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and Howell (aka The Edge), is the most expensive in Broadway history, but production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems. Once Christopher Tierney is home, his family plans a belated Christmas celebration, Tim Tierney said. Jonathan Dealwis, a tourist from New Zealand, said he saw Tierney fall. ""Spider-Man was on a bridge, and Mary Jane was dangling from it,"" he said. ""I think he was meant to sort of swoop over there, but he just fell off ... the harness, you could see it just flick off his back and fly backward.""

1050,"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- A fire broke out in the Egyptian Interior Ministry on Tuesday in downtown Cairo following a protest earlier in the day. Flames could be seen on the roof of the multistory building, and a dark plume of smoke loomed over the city. People could be seen fleeing the building as it burned. The blaze was extinguished in under an hour. The ministry was the site of a peaceful protest Tuesday morning and afternoon, with thousands of ministry employees  -- many of them police officers -- making demands, mainly for higher wages. Protesters at the building denied setting the fire, saying it originated inside. During the protest, some of them could be seen climbing on guard posts and the building's roof. ""I suspect that an electrical circuit malfunction may have caused the fire because it started at the top floors of the police communication building inside the ministry,"" said Alla Mahmoud, Interior Ministry spokesman. ""The protesters did not enter."" He said uniforms and old furniture are stored on the top floors, which would explain the thick smoke. The cause of the fire was under investigation, he said, and findings will be announced Wednesday morning. Several firefighters suffered problems due to smoke inhalation, a Ministry of Interior spokesman said. Another man was rushed away from the building in an ambulance, but the cause of his injuries was not clear. Before the fire broke out, a procession of thousands of demonstrators made its way from the Interior Ministry through Cairo's Tahrir Square -- ground zero for protests that toppled longtime Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last month -- and in the direction of the state television and radio offices. In a similar protest a few weeks ago, demonstrators set other buildings in the Interior Ministry complex ablaze, as well as cars. However, that fire did not grow to the size of Tuesday's blaze.

1051,"(CNN) -- A spacecraft survived the closest encounter ever with a comet on Thursday, tracking it just 435 miles from the comet's nucleus. Mission control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, broadcast live coverage of the event on NASA Television's Media Channel. Controllers broke into applause after hearing of the success. The agency's EPOXI Deep Impact spacecraft was expected to use two imagers and an infrared instrument to acquire data about a tiny comet named Hartley 2 as it traveled at speeds of more than 27,000 miles per hour. Scientists are still working to determine whether there was any damage to the spacecraft as the peanut-shaped comet passed by. They hope to learn to more about comets from five images detailing the close approach. ""Those early images may not be the 'money shot,' but we on the science team will prize them just as well, as they will help us further understand the nature of comets,"" said EPOXI principal investigator Mike A'Hearn of the University of Maryland, College Park, in a NASA statement. ""We certainly have our hands full. The images are full of great cometary data, and that's what we hoped for."" The images are expected to depict the comet nucleus as little more than a point of light with a fuzzy coma, a gaseous cloud, surrounding it. ""It was just incredible,"" Ed Weiler, associate administrator of the Science Missions Directorate for NASA, said of the encounter. Five years after NASA launched an 800-pound projectile into a comet in an effort to study its contents, the same spacecraft that launched the missile tracked Hartley 2 on Thursday. It is the first spacecraft to have visited two comets. NASA officials expressed hope that such missions will inspire young people to get into the field of space exploration.","Comet Hartley 2 passes just 435 miles from spacecraft .

1052,"(CNN) -- The body of an Idaho miner trapped when the roof of the mine he was working in collapsed nine days ago was recovered Sunday afternoon, the company that owns and operates the mine said. ""Words cannot express the deep sorrow we feel at the tragic loss of our friend, colleague and 30-year veteran of the mining industry. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, loved ones and friends,"" Hecla Mining Company said in a statement announcing that the body of Larry Marek had been recovered. Earlier Sunday, the company had said it believed that Marek, a Hecla employee for more than 12 years, was dead. Rescue workers had been digging through rocky earth more than 6,000 feet underground in an attempt to reach Marek, 53, following the April 15 collapse at the silver and mineral mine outside Mullan, Idaho. Marek was one of two men working in that part of the Lucky Friday mine when a 10-foot by 20-foot section of mostly rock fell on him, said Hecla's President and CEO Phil Baker. This all occurred roughly 6,150 feet below the Earth's surface. While the other man -- who has not been identified -- got out unharmed, there was no contact from Marek. Baker said earlier the cause of the collapse had not been determined, promising an investigation ""after the rescue efforts are complete."" Numerous special bolts and chain-link fence are used to keep the ground above the affected mine in place. Marek was trapped in a part of the mine where ore is removed and far from either of two possible exits, neither of which was adversely affected by the collapse, according to Baker. Lucky Friday is a ""deep underground silver, lead and zinc mine,"" according to Hecla's website. It has been in operation since 1942. Hecla has 275 of its employees routinely working at the mine, in addition to about 100 contractors, according to a company statement. Its website describes the Coeur d'Alene-based company, founded in 1891, as the ""largest and lowest-cost silver producer"" in the United States.","Larry Marek, 53, was trapped when the roof of the mine collapsed .

1053,"(CNN) -- Snow began falling over Colorado and Kansas on Tuesday as yet another round of winter weather began marching across the United States barely a week after a record-setting winter storm roared across the Midwest. A powerful weather system poised over the Rockies is forecast to dump several feet of snow in the Mountain West and up to 10 inches in some parts of Oklahoma, forecasters said. Much of Oklahoma is under a winter storm warning, but snow and sleet are predicted as far south as central Texas, with 2 to 4 inches expected to coat the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the National Weather Service said. Later in the week, the system is expected to bring rain and snow to many areas of the Deep South before delivering a wintry mix along portions of the East Coast by Thursday. Snow is expected to spread into Oklahoma and north Texas on Wednesday and into Wednesday night, said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. By Wednesday, it also will begin spreading into the Southeast. Cities like Memphis, Tennessee, and Little Rock, Arkansas, could see 4 to 8 inches of snow, while lesser amounts are expected in Nashville; Birmingham, Alabama; and Atlanta. Bitterly cold temperatures will lock the center of the country in the deep freeze as the system moves east. ""Maximum temperature departures are expected to run 30 to 40 degrees below average for the central U.S. (Tuesday) with the same departures sinking south into Oklahoma and north Texas on Wednesday,"" the Weather Service said. Rain is likely across most of the Southeast on Wednesday and Wednesday night. Scattered snow is expected in the Great Lakes region Wednesday. A historic storm left its mark on at least 30 states last week, dumping about 2 feet of snow on the Chicago area and prompting Oklahoma's governor to declare a state of emergency. Another winter system at the end of the week left central and southern Texas a mess. Ice caused 800 crashes across the Houston metropolitan area and many freeways were closed because they were too dangerous to navigate, CNN affiliate KPRC reported.

1054,"(CNN) -- A year after the onset of the worst oil spill in U.S. history, one of the most prominent Louisiana figures dealing with the disaster's aftermath remains frustrated. ""A year later, I can't look you in the eye and tell you who's in charge,"" Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said in an interview with CNN's ""In The Arena"" host Eliot Spitzer. ""They've changed out so many BP and Coast Guard people, just when you get somebody you think you can trust and make promises about cleaning...they're gone."" Nungesser pointed out that oil remains in the marshes. He admitted that although the amount of the oil is not at the same level as it was during the crisis, the oil continues to hit the shores of Louisiana, especially when a storm approaches the coast. ""The oil is being picked up off the bottom of Bay Jimmy, slammed into the marsh. It's killed the grass. There's nothing to hold the mud together."" Nungesser added, . ""We've begged for bank stabilization,...nothing's really been done out here."" Gulf waters reopened for fishing . In a BP video, ""A Year of Change,"" Group Chief Executive Bob Dudley apologizes for the crisis and highlights what BP did in solving the problem. ""In everything we've done since that day, we've tried to act as a responsible company should. The short film explains what we've done."" Dudley says, . ""It shows how we responded to the accident. How we acted to stop the leak. It shows how we worked with thousands of local people to clean the ocean and the shoreline."" Two months after the Gulf oil spill, BP agreed to create a $20 billion fund to help victims who were affected by the oil spill. Since the incident, BP has reportedly spent over $16 billion in claims and clean up. 'Extreme energy' is the new wave . Spitzer pushed Nungesser to address reports of elected officials profiting off the recovery efforts. ""Anybody that took advantage of it should be prosecuted,"" Nungesser said. ""But let's not throw the attention."" Nungesser said he wanted better transparency as to what is being done to continue the recovery of the Gulf Coast. ""We need full disclosure by BP and the Coast Guard, so this never happens again,"" said Nungesser.","Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser is among those dealing with the spill .

1055,"(CNN Student News) -- February 23, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • New Zealand • Libya • Bahrain . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It is Wednesday, February 23rd, and we have a lot of international stories to tell you about today on CNN Student News. My name is Carl Azuz. We're starting off in New Zealand. First Up: Earthquake in New Zealand . AZUZ: The earthquake that jolted the South Pacific country yesterday left one of its biggest cities in ruins. Christchurch, located on New Zealand's east coast, was badly shaken during lunch hour. It was a 6.3-magnitude quake, followed by strong aftershocks, and it was heartbreaking, according to New Zealand's prime minister. Dozens are dead. Parts of the city, as we said, are in ruins. Rescuers are streaming in from all over the country and all over the region, rescue being the nation's top priority at this point. 80 percent of Christchurch is without power and phone lines are down, making communication challenging for many survivors. This quake was actually an aftershock itself, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. New Zealand's been rattled by a series of earthquakes since last September. This one was the worst, causing what could be New Zealand's darkest day, according to its leader. Yacht Hijacking . AZUZ: What started off as an around-the-world boating trip ended in tragedy on Tuesday. Four Americans were shot and killed by pirates who hijacked their ship in the Indian Ocean last week. The U.S. military says 19 pirates were involved in the hijacking. Four of them were killed. The other 15, captured. In these photos, you can see the ship, a 58-foot yacht called the Quest, along with its owners, Jean and Scott Adams. The couple, with two friends, changed course during their boating rally. They ended up in a part of the Indian Ocean where a lot of pirate attacks happen. Zain Verjee talked with a security expert to get an idea of how these pirates work. Here's part of that conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO) ZAIN VERJEE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Just walk someone through how pirates hijack ships and, geographically, what do they do and then where do they end up? TIM HART, MARITIME UNDERWATER SECURITY CONSULTANTS: OK, well, pirates are predominantly based in the area called Puntland, which is this area here. It's in the the northeast area of Somalia. And realistically, what they'll do is they'll base themselves out of the pirate towns using mother ships, but disperse themselves. But they'll move further out into the Indian Ocean using these mother ships until they can find suitable targets. And some groups will obviously go further north, as we can see. And some will go further down south and stick to the coast of Tanzania or deep into the Indian Ocean. What they'll do is they'll move further out, they'll identify the targets and use these small attack skiffs to try and get on board. Once they've got on board and they've seized control of the vessel and the crew, they'll take the ships back to the anchorages off the coast of Somalia, and they'll sit there and negotiate with the shipping companies to pay a multi-million dollar ransom. (END VIDEO) I.D. ME . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a country that borders the Mediterranean Sea. I'm home to part of the Sahara Desert. You'll find me in northern Africa, between Tunisia and Egypt. We're talking about Libya, a country the CIA characterizes as ""an authoritarian state."" Libya Unrest . AZUZ: Protesters in Libya have been speaking out against that authoritarian government for more than a week now, and the government has reportedly responded with force. A human rights group says at least 200 people have been killed in violence there. The target of the protests is Libya's leader, Moammar Gadhafi. He's been in power more for more than forty years, as we told you yesterday. Protesters are calling on Gadhafi to step down. But during a speech yesterday, he refused. Colonel Gadhafi actually urged Libyans to go out and demonstrate for him. Ben Wedeman filed this report from one of the areas in Libya where Gadhafi's government is no longer in control. (BEGIN VIDEO) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We were able to go to the city of Tobruk in eastern Libya, where we saw that, despite what Colonel Gadhafi is saying, he is not in control of the eastern part of the country. There's no army, no police on the streets. The anti-Gadhafi protesters have been able to burn down the police station, burn down party headquarters, burn down the intelligence headquarters. They are in open revolt. Some of the protesters telling us they not only want to overthrow the regime of Moammar Gadhafi, they want to see him killed or put on trial in the international court of The Hague. We also heard from some people that they have a plan to cut the export of oil from eastern Libya. Eastern Libya is where much of Libya's oil comes from. And this, they say, they will do unless the massacres, as they describe them, committed by the Gadhafi regime are put to an end. Otherwise, the situation in the heart of the country seems fairly calm. Gas stations are open and some stores are open. Although clearly, people are not going about their normal lives. One of the big concerns here is that the Libyan Air Force, which has been used against protesters in Tripoli, could be used again in this area to punish the people of eastern Libya for trying to overthrow the regime of Moammar Gadhafi. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from eastern Libya. (END VIDEO) Rallies in Bahrain . AZUZ: ""No Shia, no Sunni, only Bahraini."" That was the chant from this massive crowd marching through the streets of Bahrain's capital on Tuesday. Shia and Sunni are two of the main sects of Islam. In the Middle Eastern nation of Bahrain, the majority of the population is Shia, while the rulers are Sunni. Protesters there have been calling for change in their country's government. And some are saying that those Sunni rulers need to go. The king of Bahrain has met with some of the leaders of the groups that are against him and his government. And he's been taking steps to reform the country. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Sowa's social studies class at Memorial Middle School in Albany, Oregon! Which of these animals is a reptile? You know what to do! Is it: A) Sea turtle, B) Frog, C) Salamander or D) Electric eel? You've got three seconds -- GO! A sea turtle was the only reptile we listed. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Creative for a Cause . AZUZ: Most sea turtles, including the loggerhead species, are endangered. But a group of 8th grade art students got the chance to meet one in person recently. This was part of a class project that started with a field trip and ended with a fundraiser that might help save some of these renowned reptiles. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO) SARAH MURRAY, GEORGIA AQUARIUM BIOLOGIST: They're an intricate part of the chain out there, the wildlife out there. We would just hate to lose this species completely. They're part of the balance, for sure. Without them, then a piece would be missing. Good morning, guys! Welcome to the Georgia Aquarium! Loggerhead sea turtles are endangered. Unfortunately, a lot of their habitats are getting destroyed along the beaches where they like to make nests. KENNETH DAVIS, 8TH GRADER: It was the first time I ever saw a sea turtle in person. When we came there, he was so excited to see us. QUAHMAYLA BROOKS, 8TH GRADER: Sea turtles are actually not only important, but they are really magnificent to look at the way they are in the water. KATY KING, DAVIS MIDDLE SCHOOL ART TEACHER: And what are some of the reasons why they are becoming endangered or why they are endangered? Ansley, name one. ANSLEY, 8TH GRADE STUDENT: Because we keep on destroying their habitat. SAMANTHA GODWIN, 8TH GRADER: We're gathering sketches of Murphy over here, and we're going to make these little clay models that we are going to sell so that we can raise money to actually adopt some sea turtles. DAVIS: I really think it's going to help make a difference because, not only for us, maybe other schools will say, ""this pretty much is a good idea, we probably should do the same."" You don't have to be a certain age to help out sea turtles that are endangered. KHAYREE ACKLIN, 8TH GRADER: I really didn't think I would be actually doing a project of something that is important to the world. MURRAY: I think it's awesome. I mean, having 8th graders take such a stance and an initiative to write letters to Congress and to care about these animals, I think it's absolutely great. We need all the help we can get. KING: I can teach the kids that we are a voice for change, that we can make people aware. And I think that's the purpose of an educator, is to make kids know that. MURRAY: They should want them for their children, as well. They should want them around for future generations, to come for their great-great-grandchildren. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, it might seem a little early to be talking about a presidential race. But don't tell that to these guys. They're not running for the White House. They're campaigning to be one of the racing presidents for Major League Baseball's Washington Nationals. Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln: These monumental mascots are certainly at the head of the class when it comes to presidential pedigree. And after spending a season rounding the bases... Goodbye . AZUZ: ...they'll be in great shape to make a presidential run. They just better make sure they follow the rules, though, 'cause no one will root for a commander in cheat.

1056,"Dallas (CNN) -- Texas firefighters Wednesday battled blazes that have scorched more than a million acres and have been burning for more than a week, according to the Texas Forest Service. ""We're actually seeing Texas burn from border to border. We've got it in west Texas, in east Texas, in north Texas, in south Texas -- it's all over the state,"" Forest Service spokeswoman April Saginor told CNN Radio. ""We've got one in the Dallas area that's four fires that have actually merged together."" Saginor said firefighters from 34 states are now in Texas battling blazes that, over the past two weeks, have destroyed more than 170 homes. ""Some (fires) are over 100,000 acres and they've been burning for over a week, so that's our priority right now,"" Saginor said, ""to put out the big ones."" Firefighter Greg Simmons died Friday trying to extinguish the East Sidwynicks fire in Eastland County. Five other volunteer firefighters have been injured by the East Sidwynicks fire, which has burned 3,000 acres. High-res photos: Wildfires blaze across Texas . Another firefighter was treated and released from a hospital in Graham after his bulldozer clipped a gas line and caused an explosion. ""The state of Texas is under siege,"" Saginor said. ""Wildfire is dangerous and it's threatening homes, lives and property on a daily basis. We caution residents to take this threat seriously and heed the call of their local authorities when told to evacuate."" The tinder-dry landscape has provided no shortage of fuel: On Wednesday, emergency personnel responded to four new fires across more than 1,000 acres, according to the Texas Forest Service. On Tuesday, they responded to 10 new fires, totaling more than 2,000 acres. Since January 1, the Texas Forest Service said, it has responded to more than 800 fires that have damaged some 5,000 structures across 1.4 million acres. Fire-friendly conditions were expected to return Thursday in various parts of the state, the National Weather Service said. ""Even if we get two inches of rain, the ground's going to eat it up,"" said David Hennig, a Weather Service meteorologist in Midland, Texas. ""We need a pattern shift."" West Texas averages nearly 15 inches of rain a year, according to Hennig. In the past six months, only 13-hundredths of an inch of rain have been recorded in that part of the state. While October through March is typically the dry season, that amount of rainfall is far below what it should be, Hennig said. He said weather models show the possibility of more storms this weekend and perhaps next week. While the rain is needed, storms accompanied by lightning pose a fire risk, he said. The Guadalupe Mountains face an extreme risk of fire through Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. Van Horn, which is 165 miles west of Odessa, is expected to face a critical fire threat on Thursday, as well as the nearby state Highway 54 corridor and the southeast New Mexico plains. One of the largest fires plaguing Texas rampaged between the towns of Graham and Graford. That fire, fewer than 70 miles west of Dallas-Fort Worth, burned into residential areas surrounding Possum Kingdom Lake Monday night, destroying and damaging homes in four or five neighborhoods, according to Marq Webb, a spokesman with the Texas Forest Service. Possum Kingdom resident Jackie Fewell set up a blog to provide updates on the crisis since fire warnings first were extended to the 3,000-home lake community. Crews protect Texas observatory with fire of their own . ""I was frustrated by a lot of misinformation that was being passed around by a lot of well-intentioned people through Facebook and text-messaging,"" she said. Fewell set up the blog Saturday as a part of the website for Pondera Properties, the lake's managing real-estate company, where she works. ""We have been able to generate this incredible response,"" Fewell said, noting the site has served as a bridge between residents in need of help and those able to provide it. ""We get remarks from people all over needing help,"" she said. ""If we put out a query to get 200 leather gloves to the area, we'll have those gloves within a few days."" Wildfire ravages home but spares family roosters . Fewell said the site has been responsible for aiding residents in a number of ways, from saving abandoned pets to providing real-time updates on properties threatened by the blaze. The Palo Pinto County Sheriff's office said it evacuated 200 residents from the town of Palo Pinto and moved them to shelters. Two buses were sent to evacuate jail inmates, said Deputy Randy Hunter. That evacuation order was lifted Wednesday afternoon. Dianne Simpson told CNN affiliate KSAN that she and her husband watched nervously as a wildfire approached their house near the Tom Green County-Coke County line, where residents had evacuated. Texas Forest Service: Fire dangers and advisories . ""We just sat out here on the deck and watched it burn, and it was just pretty devastating,"" Simpson said. ""You're just sitting here going 'There's nothing I can do.' "" According to KSAN, the blaze stopped just 330 yards from the Simpsons' house. By Wednesday, the evacuation order for Coke County had been lifted, according to Texas Forest Service spokeswoman Saginor. CNNRadio's Thomas Andres and CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: Forest Service responded to 4 new fires Wednesday totaling more than 1,000 acres .

1057,"(CNN) -- A travel website on Saturday flashed the word ""CANCELED"" in blinking red letters across an online flight schedule for Missouri's largest airport after a rash of severe weather stranded travelers across the region. Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, the country's 30th busiest, was closed after a tornado struck the facility on Friday, but officials expect it to reopen Sunday. ""All departing and arriving flights are canceled until further notice pending full safety assessments of airport facilities,"" the airport website said Saturday. St. Louis-bound flights were diverted to neighboring airports as a result of the storms, including more than a dozen flights to Kansas City International Airport, according to airport spokesman Joe McBride. Rerouted passengers were put up in hotels, and at least three airlines tried to accommodate frustrated travelers on Saturday by busing them from Kansas City to St. Louis, he said. See iReporter's shots of airport damage . Airport Director Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge said an American Airlines 757 jet suffered significant damage and four other American aircraft had minor damage. Friday night, lines of weary passengers wrapped around airport car rental centers in a frantic attempt to find alternate transportation. ""It was pretty crazy,"" said Enterprise employee Daniel Tighe. ""People were getting into Kansas City just to figure out that their flight had been canceled. ""We took in 30 walk-in reservations just last night,"" he added. ""Plus it's the holiday weekend."" By Saturday the influx of one-way car reservations had abated as rerouted passengers made their way to St. Louis. ""We had quite a few runs to the Greyhound bus station and train station downtown,"" said Chris Bos, an employee for Nick & Nino's taxi service in Kansas City. ""Most people didn't complain. There's not much else they could do."" AirTran said it will fly its St. Louis-bound passengers to Bloomington, Illinois, or Kansas City, Missouri, according to company spokesman Christopher White. But potential thunderstorms and flooding still loomed over the St. Louis area by Saturday afternoon, the National Weather Service said. Major damage was evident in nearby communities, where an estimated 30,000 homes were without power. See iReport images from elsewhere in Missouri . Meanwhile, 30-minute delays lingered at Chicago's Midway and O'Hare airports, where severe storms prompted more than 500 flight cancellations Friday, according to Karen Pride, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Aviation.","Rerouted passengers are put up in hotels .

1058,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese officials' concerns over food contamination expanded beyond the country's borders Tuesday as tests detected radiation in ocean water offshore. Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said that high levels of radioactive substances were found in seawater near the plant, but said that the results did not represent a threat to human health. ""There should be no immediate health impact. If this situation continues for a long period of time, some impact can occur,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters. The impact such radiation could have on marine life was unclear. Japanese authorities were scheduled to measure radioactivity in waters around the plant on Tuesday and Wednesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Earlier seawater radiation monitoring detected levels of iodine-131 that were 126.7 times higher than government-set standards, the electric company said on its website. Its monitors detected cesium-134, which has a half-life of about two years, about 24.8 times higher than the government standards. Cesium-137 was found to be 16.5 times higher than the standard. The electric company detected these levels in seawater 100 meters (328 feet) south of the nuclear power plant Monday afternoon. Radioactive particles disperse in the ocean, and the farther away from the shore a sample is taken, the less concentrated the contamination should be. Because of the huge amount of dilution that happens in the ocean, there's not much chance of deep-water fish being tainted, said Murray McBride, a professor at Cornell University who studies soil and water contamination. ""I think the ocean can handle that a lot better than the physical environment and population centers,"" said Jim Walsh, an international security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a CNN consultant. ""We don't want any of this to happen, but better it go out to sea than stay in Japan."" Winds have largely blown radioactive material emitted by the plant offshore since an earthquake and tsunami crippled cooling systems at the plant March 11. But tests have detected contamination of food grown near the plant. The Japanese government has banned the sale of raw milk from Fukushima Prefecture, where the plant is located, and prohibited the sale of spinach from neighboring Ibaraki Prefecture after finding levels of radioactive iodine and cesium higher than government standards, the country's health ministry reported. And officials in Fukushima halted the distribution of locally grown vegetables outside the prefecture. The government has also banned sales of spinach and milk from parts of Gunma and Tochigi Prefectures, according to the prime minister's office. On Tuesday Edano said contamination had not been detected in other agricultural products. ""The products which are being grown in these areas are being monitored and the monitoring will continue,"" he said. He urged consumers to ""try not to panic,"" noting that the government had stopped shipments of any farm products they believed could be contaminated. Edano has stressed that officials believe the levels of radiation in food -- while above the legal standards -- do not pose any immediate health risk, saying they were mostly dangerous only if consumed repeatedly over one's lifetime. On Monday a spokesman for the World Health Organization said short-term exposure to food contaminated by radiation from Japan's damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant poses no immediate health risk. Tests have also detected radiation in tap water. On Monday, authorities in the village of Iitake urged residents to avoid drinking tap water that tests showed contained more than three times the maximum standard of radioactive iodine. Water in other jurisdictions showed lesser signs of contamination, although far below levels of concern under Japanese law, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency website. The U.N. agency said it had received reports from Japan's government that six out of 46 samples tested positive for the iodine-131 radioactive isotope. Iodine and cesium isotopes are byproducts of nuclear fission in reactors such as the ones damaged in the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern Honshu, Japan's main island. Although iodine-131 has a radioactive half-life of eight days, cesium-137's half-life is about 30 years. The decision to prohibit produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast Japan hit by the earthquake, tsunami and other potential fallout from the Fukushima plant. Edano has said farmers will be compensated for revenue lost by the restrictions. ""Primarily this is due to the nuclear reactor accident, so we assume (Tokyo Electric Power Company) will be held responsible for compensation. The government might take some supplementary action,"" he said. Fukushima ranks among Japan's top producer of fruits, vegetables and rice. Ibaraki, south of Fukushima, supplies Tokyo with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables and is Japan's third-largest pork producer. For radiation to be an issue for rice, the contamination would have to be more severe and prolonged that what has been seen so far, said McBride, the Cornell University professor. Soil contamination was a huge issue around Chernobyl, but the radiation emitted from the Fukushima Daiichi plant isn't anywhere near that level, he said. ""We're not at that stage; that's the scenario you have to consider if contamination gets severe enough,"" McBride said.

1059,"London, England (CNN) -- A fishing ship whose crew had to be rescued from a fire is limping to port in the United Kingdom, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency told CNN Wednesday. Ninety-eight crew members were rescued from the Athena early Wednesday, while 13 remain on board to keep the fire under control and pilot the ship to port, the agency's Claire Johns said. The container ship Vega -- which happened to be nearby when the Athena caught fire -- is accompanying the ship to Falmouth, England, where both ships are due Thursday night, she said. The rescued crew members are aboard the Vega. The rescue operation was complicated by Athena's distance from land -- some 230 miles (370 kilometers) southwest of the British Isles of Scilly and 270 miles (435 kilometers) west of the Pointe Du Penmarche in Brittany, France. Because they can carry only so much fuel, British Royal Navy helicopters only had about 20 minutes over the rescue scene before having to return, according to the agency. A plane was also scrambled from France to help with communications during the rescue, the Coastguard said. The company that owns the ship does not know the cause of the fire yet, a representative said. ""Hopefully tomorrow when the firefighters come on board (it) will be completely extinguished and cleared and then we will know more about what happened,"" Sue Philbrow told CNN by e-mail from the Faroe Islands, where the ship is registered. Five ships responded to the emergency call to pick up crewmembers, who include Chinese, Russian, Peruvian and Scandinavian personnel, among others. The Athena is a fishing ship that processes fish on board. CNN's Eileen Hsieh and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report .","NEW: The ship owner doesn't know the cause of the fire .

1060,"(CNN) -- On the first anniversary of an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling platform, which triggered the biggest oil disaster in U.S. history, BP filed suit Wednesday against the manufacturer of the rig platform's blowout preventer. ""BP has sued Cameron for its faulty design and manufacture of the blowout preventer (BOP) and its negligence in the maintenance and modification of the BOP, a critical safety device that failed to prevent the blowout of the Macondo well,"" BP spokesman Scott Dean said in a statement. ""When activated in a loss-of-control situation, a BOP, through one of its preventers known as the blind shear rams, is designed to cut through drill pipe that may be across the BOP and seal the well to contain the hydrocarbons and keep them from flowing to the rig,"" Dean said. A report released March 23 determined that the oil spill was caused by a piece of drill pipe trapped in the rig platform's blowout preventer, a device intended to stop oil from flowing into the Gulf. The report was commissioned by various U.S. agencies, including the Interior Department and the Department of Homeland Security. The Interior Department has said a much broader report that relies on additional sources of data, including eyewitness accounts and photos, will be released this summer. Meanwhile, officials in Louisiana Wednesday called on BP to make good on its promises to make everything right. ""We continue to call on BP to fulfill the promises of their ads,"" said Gov. Bobby Jindal. ""We continue to call on BP to truly make it right, here in Louisiana. We have 300 miles of our coast that continue to be oiled."" Jindal said he has called on BP ""not to wait five years, 10 years, 20 years,"" to make key payments as part of the Natural Resources Damage Assessment process. ""We know those payments could be hundreds of millions, maybe even billions of dollars. We again call on BP to make these payments within days, not weeks, not months ... so we can proceed with restoring our coast. ""We stood here with some leaders from BP toward the end of last year and they made promises -- promises about replanting oysters, promises about building a saltwater hatchery -- and those promises have still not been kept."" Jindal said he was also calling on both BP and the U.S. Coast Guard to continue to clean up the shoreline, noting that ""40% of the Louisiana coastline that had been oiled during this spill continue to be oiled today."" The oil spill has prompted a flood of lawsuits against BP, Transocean and Halliburton from a variety of plaintiffs, including owners of Gulf businesses who say they suffered heavy financial losses because of the spill. Transocean owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. Halliburton installed the rig's cement casing. The plaintiffs also include Transocean shareholders who contend the company falsely claimed it had remedied past safety problems with its blowout preventers before the Gulf spill. Dean said BP is filing suit ""as part of the legal process to ensure that all parties involved in the Macondo well are appropriately held accountable for their roles in contributing to the Deepwater Horizon accident."" Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines Parish, was among the officials joining Jindal at a news conference. ""We need to see the sense of urgency,"" Nungesser said. ""I stand here today, a year later, and I still can't look you in the eye and tell you who's in charge,"" he said, repeating a statement he made Tuesday night in an interview with CNN's ""In The Arena"" host Eliot Spitzer. ""We need to make sure we begin coastal restoration this week -- not next year, not the following year,"" Nungesser added. Jindal and other officials remembered the 11 people killed on the Deepwater Horizon, saying they were heroes. In a statement, BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said, ""We remember 11 fellow workers and we deeply regret the loss of their lives."" The company said its thoughts are with their families, friends and colleagues. ""We also remember those who were injured and affected in other ways by the accident and the subsequent oil spill,"" Dudley said. ""We are committed to meet our obligations to those affected by this tragedy and we will continue our work to strengthen safety and risk management across BP."" On its website, BP lays out numerous steps it has taken, including payments made. The company says it paid nearly $400 million in response to more than 150,000 individual and business claims. It also paid $1.14 billion to federal, state and local governmental entities to cover claims, response and removal costs and payments. In 2010, BP paid $5 billion into a $20 billion trust designed to satisfy claims adjudicated by the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, and the company ""is committed to making additional payments of $1.25 billion each quarter until the end of 2013,"" it says.

1061,"Omagh, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- A Catholic police officer was killed in a blast on Saturday in Northern Ireland, said police and politicians at the scene. Police said an explosive device detonated under a car in the Highfield Close area of Omagh, Northern Ireland, in the afternoon. The victim -- Ronan Kerr -- was 25 years old and had recently joined the Police Service of Northern Ireland. ""Tonight, tragedy has returned to Omagh,"" PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott told reporters. ""I have no words to describe the awfulness of this afternoon, and my abhorrence and anger at this wasted life. And I know that anger and abhorrence is shared by all decent people in Northern Ireland and across Ireland and across the world."" Thirteen years ago, a bombing in Omagh killed 29 people and wounded more than 300. ""This heinous crime will not succeed in its evil intent of destroying the peaceful and democratic future to which the people of Northern Ireland are so clearly committed,"" said Irish President Mary McAleese. ""My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and colleagues at this time."" The head of the Catholic church in Ireland, Cardinal Sean Brady, similarly condemned the killing. ""The deliberate taking of innocent human life is always wrong,"" he said. ""I implore the perpetrators of this shameful killing to realise the futility of their actions, and to call off this senseless campaign."" Northern Ireland was the scene of frequent violence between pro-Irish and pro-British forces over a period of three decades. About 3,000 people were killed before a power-sharing deal known as the Good Friday Agreement was reached in 1998. Some dissident groups remain active.","The Irish president and the head of the Catholic church in Ireland offer their condolences .

1062,"Milan, Italy (CNN) -- Rescue crews continued their search Thursday for more than 200 people after the boat they were in capsized in the Mediterranean Sea. The boat was carrying about 300 people, survivors told rescue officials, according to Italian Coast Guard spokesman Cosimo Nicastro. It sank Tuesday about 62 kilometers (39 miles) west off Lampedusa in Maltese waters, the Italian Coast Guard said. By Thursday, officials had rescued 53 people, and recovered 15 to 20 bodies, he said. ""We are following with sorrow and concern what is happening in Lampedusa,"" Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said. Many of the survivors came from African countries, such as Eritrea, Somalia and Niger, the Italian daily newspaper, Corriere della Sera said. Many others were fleeing the war in Libya, the newspaper said. The incident is the latest in a number of tragic ends in what has become a steady flow of people who set sail from Africa -- especially Tunisia -- to the Italian island of Lampedusa. According to Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, more than 22,000 migrants have landed on Lampedusa in the past few weeks. Though owned by Italy, Lampedusa's closest shore is Tunisia. ""Of course, it's a crisis, but the Europeans do not want to call it a migration crisis,"" he said. According to International Organization for Migration, the majority of unauthorized immigrants arriving in Lampedusa are Tunisian. Some 2,000 other African migrants have arrived on the island after sailing from the Libyan coast, the agency said. A popular uprising in Tunisia led to the ouster of its president, Zine al-Abedine Ben Ali, in January. While protesters succeeded in spurring a regime change there, many Tunisians are not seeing the kind of transformation they were imagining. Italy's foreign minister has estimated as many as 300,000 Libyans could try to leave and could potentially end up in his country. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Neil Curry and Lisa Sylvester contributed to this report.","Survivors say the boat was carrying about 300 people .

1063,"(CNN) -- Police in New Hampshire are searching for a missing mother after her baby daughter was discovered in an abandoned car with its engine running and hazard lights flashing, authorities said. Krista Dittmeyer, 20, has not been seen since Saturday, when the 14-month-old was found alone in her car, parked in the parking lot of a ski area at Mount Cranmore, New Hampshire, according to Conway, New Hampshire, police spokesman Christopher Perley. The car was discovered early Saturday morning by an unidentified passerby who noticed the flashing hazard lights. When the witness ""approached the car, they found that it was unoccupied, it was running, the driver's door was slightly ajar and there was a baby in the back seat,"" Perley told reporters Monday. The witness alerted police and the baby was taken to nearby Memorial Hospital, where it was determined to be in good health and then reunited with its grandmother, Perley said. Police also conducted a thorough search using fire and rescue personnel, New Hampshire Fish and Game staffers and police dogs. A murky pond has been drained and an air search was conducted Monday with no sign of Dittmeyer, Perley said. ""We don't have any information that leads us to believe that she's not alive, and we're going to continue to investigate as if we can reunite her with her family,"" Perley said in a Monday press conference. Dittmeyer, who lived with roommates in Portland, Maine, had no history of mental illness and no criminal record, Perley said. ""She would never, ever, ever, leave her in a car by herself,"" Dittmeyer's friend Kathy Pratt told CNN affiliate WMUR, referring to Dittmeyer's daughter. Dittmeyer, who last spoke with her family at 8 p.m. on Friday, has friends in the North Conway area. ""We know that she would do whatever it takes to get back here and be with her daughter,"" her sister, Kayla Dittmeyer, told WMUR. Police are testing physical evidence found at the scene, along with two vehicles -- one of them Krista Dittmeyer's black Nissan Sentra, Perley said in the press conference. Authorities are also executing multiple search warrants and applying for a warrant for Dittmeyer's cell phone records, he said.

1064,"(CNN) -- At least 98 people have been killed by the earthquake in New Zealand and the death toll could rise, Prime Minister John Key said Thursday, as hundreds remain missing -- among them, nearly 30 Japanese students. As more bodies are recovered and as the identification process continues, authorities acknowledge that the number of fatalities will rise. Some 431 people have been admitted to hospital emergency rooms since the quake, according to Iona Wassilieff with New Zealand's National Crisis Management Center. Authorities say another 1,000 people have been treated for minor injuries. Currently, 27 Japanese students are among those missing, according to Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Most of that group is from Toyama Foreign Language College; two are students from another language school in Tokyo and five are on personal study trips from other parts of Japan. Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper interviewed two victims from Toyama Foreign Language College who were pulled from the rubble in New Zealand. Kento Okuda and Norika Masutani are both 19-years-old and students at the language school, and now both are patients at Christchurch Hospital. Okuda said he was in the cafeteria having lunch on the fourth floor when he felt the first, big shake, according to the paper. The floor gave way and he felt himself falling, but said he had no no idea how far he fell. The entire building was dark, he said, and he realized he couldn't move his right leg because it was trapped under heavy rubble. Masutani was also on the fourth floor when the quake hit, Asahi Shimbun said. She said she panicked when the floor gave way. Both Masutani and Okuda told the paper that, after the quake, all the students caught in rubble tried to talk to each other and do a count of who was able to talk and who couldn't. Many of their fellow Japanese students did not respond. Masutani told the paper that aftershocks progressively brought more rubble down around her, shrinking the void she was in. She smelled smoke and gas, she said, adding, ""I was scared that a fire was coming."" But a rescue team located Masutani and pulled her out, according to Asahi Shimbun. She has bruises and sprains, but no major injuries. Okuda told the paper he heard the rescue team approaching him. He lost his leg but said but that he had no details on when it was cut off or when he was pulled from the rubble. ""The reason why I survived in the dark for hours is that we could talk to each other. Please help my classmates,"" Masutani told the paper, referring to the missing students believed trapped under the rubble. Officials have given up hope of rescuing at least 100 people who were trapped in the Canterbury TV building in downtown Christchurch. Police said they were ""100% certain"" no one still trapped in the building was still alive. Officials fear that people who remain trapped inside the Pyne Gould corporation building are dead , according to CNN's Anna Coren. House-to-house searches are the priority Thursday for rescue workers in Christchurch, authorities explained at a news conference early Thursday morning. Christchurch has been divided into a grid pattern, Collins and other officials said. Urban search-and-rescue teams with paramedic and building-assessment training have fanned out across key neighborhoods searching for earthquake victims. Meanwhile, New Zealand's Red Cross says roughly 900 people took shelter in welfare centers overnight Wednesday. Also Wednesday, confusion over the status of an Australian woman who was trapped in rubble was resolved. Anne Vos, who spoke to the outside world by mobile phone while trapped beneath rubble, is recuperating in a hospital in New Zealand, according to Dana Robertson with the Australian High Commission in Canberra. Vos made calls to the media and her family in Australia Tuesday before she was rescued from the rubble of the Pyne Gould Corporation Building in the central business district, according to Australian and New Zealand media. ""A couple of hours ago, I thought I'd had it,"" she told New Zealand network TV3 Tuesday. ""I thought it was 'Goodbye Anne.' "" ""I've managed to wiggle out a bit because I couldn't breathe. Now I've got a wee bit of air here. I rang my kids to say goodbye. ""My daughter was crying and I was crying because I thought 'This is it.' You've got to tell them you love them. ... I'm not going to give up ..."" she said. Earlier, news outlets reported she had been rescued, but others said later that rescuers had confused her with someone else. Another woman named ""Ann"" was pulled from the same ruined building on the same day. Ann Bodkin took cover under her desk in the same building when the quake struck. She was trapped in her office building for 24 hours. ""The sun came out the moment she was removed from the building,"" said Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker. ""It was like God turned on the lights."" Rescue workers applauded as Bodkin was pulled alive from the rubble. She was one of about 30 people rescued Wednesday from the Pyne Gould building and the Canterbury Television building, the two blocks most severely damaged in the quake. The quake toppled buildings onto buses, buckled streets and ripped the facades of iconic churches, including the Christchurch Cathedral and the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. It also cut power for most of the city, leaving rescuers working overnight under floodlights. ""This is just heartbreaking,"" Prime Minister John Key said. ""This may be New Zealand's darkest day."" As the rescuers scrambled to reach survivors, the Web turned into a crisis center as Google offered a service for people searching for loved ones. Google's crisis response service provided a place to find information, including telephone numbers and incident reports. The initial quake, which struck early Tuesday afternoon, was followed by a series of aftershocks, the New Zealand Ministry of Defense said. A U.S. emergency official was in Christchurch as part of a delegation working with the New Zealand government on disaster response. ""I was at the airport when the earthquake struck,"" said Tim Manning, deputy administrator for the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. Manning said he was working with the U.S. Embassy to find citizens who need assistance and providing help to New Zealand officials. Southern New Zealand has been hit by a series of quakes since September 4 when a 7.1-magnitude temblor struck the area. The earthquake hit in the predawn hours, with the deserted streets helping to keep injuries to a minimum. There were no deaths from that quake. The September quake struck deeper below ground and farther away from Christchurch than Tuesday's temblor, causing less damage despite the higher magnitude, officials said. The U.S. Geological Survey said Tuesday's earthquake was part of the ""aftershock sequence"" from the September earthquake. ""It's a nightmare. A lot of people were just getting back on their feet after the original quake,"" said Kevin Fenaughty, data center manager for GNS Science, an earth-science research institute.

1066,"(CNN) -- A deadly 2009 ""sweat lodge"" retreat in Arizona left participants so sickened that the scene resembled ""a battleground"" with people vomiting, foaming at the mouth and with their eyes nearly popping out, according to one survivor who testified Thursday. ""I saw people agonizing,"" said Lou Caci, a participant from Winnipeg, Manitoba. ""It looked like a battle ground. People are just laying there."" Caci, who earlier testified he fell at one point and badly burned his arm on the heated rocks, continued his testimony Thursday in the trial of self-help guru James Arthur Ray. Ray is accused of manslaughter in the deaths of three persons at his October 2009 ""Spiritual Warrior"" retreat in the desert. Killed were Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York; James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and volunteer Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota. At least 15 others who took part in the sweat lodge ceremony became ill, but more than 40 others were uninjured, and defense lawyers have argued that the deaths were accidental. James Ray's attorneys have also argued that exposure to an unknown toxin, perhaps a pesticide, could have caused the fatalities. The event participants paid up to $10,000 to seek ""new areas of consciousness,"" according to this week's testimony. The lodge -- made of willow trees and branches, and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to perilously high temperatures, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke. The sweat lodge ceremony consisted of eight rounds, with each round lasting 10 to 15 minutes. While they were not prevented from leaving, participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds. Under questioning by the prosecution, Caci recounted how he re-entered the sweat lodge and came across one participant, Neuman. She was among those who died. ""Seeing the way Liz was I knew there was something terribly wrong. I was a bit apprehensive about being back in there just because of the pain I had in my arm. We finished the last ceremony and I was more focused on staying awake,"" Caci told the court. ""She was a heavy-set woman and I couldn't quite get her out. So a fellow named Randy helped me,"" Caci said. ""I was lifting her little by little. She was heavy. Randy was helping me. We would go, 'One, two, three' -- and we would lift. I think her face dragged on the ground a little bit, but we helped her out.""","Self-help guru James Arthur Ray is on trial for manslaughter of three persons .

1067,"Washington (CNN) -- For hours on March 21, U.S. Air Force Maj. Kenneth Harney of Lexington, Kentucky, and Capt. Tyler Stark of Littleton, Colorado, were the focus of nearly every U.S. service member in the Mediterranean Sea region. Nearly a dozen aircraft, a platoon of Marines and even Libyan civilians worked to rescue Harney and Stark after their F-15 crashed in eastern Libya. Most details about the mission, including their names, were a closely held secret by the military. But earlier this month, with little notice, their identities and details of their rescue came out during a welcome-home ceremony at their air base. For the first time, the men spoke publicly to a small group of friends, family and Air Force personnel. The Air Force public affairs office posted pictures and video of the event on its official website, even after U.S. military public affairs officers involved in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya told CNN their names would never be made public. ""You feel the weight of not only the Air Force, but the entire military, focusing on you, making sure you get home,"" Stark said recently in a video prepared by the Air Force. U.S. still not ready to recognize Libyan opposition . The men were part of a the 48th Fighter Wing normally based at RAF Lakenheath, a Royal Air Force base that has hosted U.S. Air Force units for years in Suffolk, England. But on March 21 they took off from the U.S. air base in Aviano, Italy, in support of the no-fly zone enforcement over Libya. At some point they ran into trouble. ""We soon find ourselves in a situation where we are forced to eject over potentially hostile territory, and over the country of Libya. Something that neither one of us would ever have thought that we'd have to do,"" Harney, the pilot of the Strike Eagle said. The Air Force is still trying to figure out why the plane crashed and a post-incident investigation is ongoing, but four days after the crash, Vice Adm. Bill Gortney, director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, told reporters that the military was ""confident that it is not a result of hostile fire."" Homes destroyed in battle for Misrata . After the ejection, Harney -- ""Meso"" to his fellow fliers -- and ""Mask"" Stark became separated. ""When you find yourself alone, and you're isolated, in a country where there's hostiles, you are scared,"" said Harney, a veteran of both the Afghan and Iraq wars. Stark was found by Libyan civilians who protected him from possible retaliation by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, and eventually he was taken safely back to Europe. Details of how he was taken out of Libya have yet to be disclosed. Harney's rescue came more quickly. He stayed in communications with another F-15 pilot still in the air over Libya. Eventually an MV-22 Osprey carrying Marines who were part of a Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel, or TRAP, team landed near his position. ""As that back door opened, I see a group of young Marine recon units jump out, and that was probably the best feeling I've ever felt in my entire life,"" Harney said. He was flown to the USS Kearsarge for a quick medical check then a short time later sent home with Stark to RAF Lakenheath, where friends and family welcomed them with hugs and a rendition of ""God Bless America.""","Two Air Force fliers went down over Libya on March 21 .

1069,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Thousands of Japanese filled evacuation shelters or joined foreigners seeking a way out of the country Thursday in the aftermath of last week's devastating earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear crisis at stricken reactors. Cold, snowy weather in parts of the Asian nation further heightened the hardship of a nation facing what its leaders call its biggest disaster since World War II. Fears of possible nuclear catastrophe were evident. After rallying Wednesday, stocks in Japan fell early Thursday, with the Nikkei 225 index, the most prominent measure of stocks traded in Tokyo, down about 2% in early trading. Concerns spread far beyond Japan's borders, with U.S. stock markets falling and the U.S. military dispatching a radiation-sniffing aircraft to determine if toxic clouds were rising from disabled reactors. Nearly 13,000 people are dead or missing and several hundred thousand have been left homeless from Friday's earthquake and tsunami. An extraordinary television address Wednesday by Emperor Akihito showed the magnitude of the catastrophe. Such a speech by a sitting emperor is usually reserved for times of extreme crisis or war, and Emperor Akihito's direct appeal to the public was the first time he has spoken to the public amid such a crisis. ""I truly hope the victims of the disaster never give up hope, take care of themselves, and live strong for tomorrow,"" said the dignified and understated Emperor Akihito, in a calm and poignant oration delivered from the Imperial Palace. ""Also, I want all citizens of Japan to remember everyone who has been affected by the devastation, not only today but for a long time afterwards -- and help with the recovery."" The 77-year-old ceremonial but deeply revered chief of state underlined Prime Minister Naoto Kan's earlier assertion that Japan is going through its worst crisis since World War II. The emperor delivered his speech on the same day that white smoke and a new blaze at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant added to radiation fears. ""Currently, the entire nation is putting forth its best effort to save all suffering people. However, under the severe cold weather, evacuees are having a very difficult time because they lack food, water, and energy sources,"" he said. ""Also, I am deeply concerned that the current nuclear plant situation is critical. I truly hope that with so many people working together to help, the situation will not worsen."" On Thursday morning, helicopters operated by Japan's self-defense forces made four passes over the plant's No. 3 reactor to dump water. Public broadcaster NHK reported that at least 12 water-cannon trucks would be brought in, so that forces could try to douse the reactor from the ground, . While Japan has called for anyone living within 12 miles of the disable nuclear plant to evacuate, Great Britain and the United States dramatically expanded their evacuation warnings Wednesday, telling their respective citizens within 50 miles to either stay indoors or move away. It was the first time since the nuclear crisis began that the United States and Japanese governments have differed on advising what their citizens should do. Before Wednesday, the United States had urged American citizens in Japan to follow the recommendations of the Japanese government. A cloud of smoke seen at the stricken plant sparked fear there might have been a breach in the containment vessel in the nuclear plant's No. 3 reactor, government officials said. Earlier explosions and fires also had hit other reactors at the plant. Officials asked workers at the plant to evacuate Wednesday after the cloud rose above the plant and radiation levels spiked. The levels later fell and authorities allowed the workers to return, the Tokyo Electric Power Company said. Tests on tap water in Fukushima city, 80 kilometers (50 miles) away found radiation -- though at levels not harmful to the human body, and later tests showed no radiation in the water, government officials said. Officials have been working to resolve cooling problems at four of Fukushima Daiichi's six reactors in the wake of the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami. Japanese authorities could not rule out the possibility of a meltdown at the troubled reactors. Workers have been pumping sea water into reactors in an effort to prevent further damage. A meltdown occurs when nuclear fuel rods cannot be cooled, thus melting the reactor core and causing a release of radioactivity. In the worst-case scenario, the fuel can spill out of the containment unit and spread toxic radioactivity through the air and water. That, public health officials say, can cause both immediate and long-term health problems, including radiation poisoning and cancer. As the government and workers scrambled to stabilize the plant, the search continued for survivors from last week's cruel combination of natural disasters. By Wednesday night, the National Police Agency reported 4,314 deaths. Another 8,606 people are missing and 2,282 were injured, the agency said. The number of dead is expected to go up as rescuers reach more hard-hit areas. Public broadcaster NHK has reported that 450,000 people were living in shelters, where people grieved over lost loved ones and worried about relatives who are missing from villages and towns inundated by the tsunami waves off the east coast of Honshu. Thousands of people packed Narita International Airport in Tokyo, with some sitting on floors. ""We just headed for the mountains directly away from the nuclear power station,"" Richard Struthers, who lives about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the Fukushima plant. He said he is ""taking no chances"" with his baby son. Boris Suban of Moriya -- about 210 kilometers (130 miles) from the nuclear plant -- decided to travel across the country to Hiroshima prefecture -- a location he admits is ironic. U.S. planes dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. 'We thought that the reactor is not safe and too near,"" Suban said. ""Plus, if the panic spreads, we will be unable to leave Japan and get the full exposure sitting on our sofa."" Meanwhile, across the country, emergency workers from Japan, foreign governments and international aid groups continued to scour tangled and displaced piles of debris, searching for survivors. Scores of countries, regions and international organizations have offered assistance, according to the Japanese foreign affairs ministry. Rescue work is being complicated by the hundreds of aftershocks that have rocked Japan since Friday's quake. Since the initial earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey has reported about 35 quakes with magnitudes of 6.0 or greater, and more than 200 others greater than 5.0. John Roos, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, said the U.S. military has delivered over 7,000 pounds of food and water to the disaster area so far and more than $5.8 million of U.S. aid has come to Japan. He said nine U.S. ships are assisting in the relief operations, and helicopters and other aircraft have now flown over 50 missions to conduct survivor recoveries, transport passengers, and distribute food and water supplies in the most needy areas. Donations rolled in. Delta Air Lines is pledging $1 million in cash and ""in-kind support"" to disaster relief efforts, for example. Meanwhile, the crisis has rekindled debate and concern over nuclear power. Energy Secretary Steven Chu told members of Congress Wednesday that the Obama White House still backs the further development of American nuclear power -- a stance opposed by some key congressional Democrats. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero announced Wednesday that the government will review safety at all of Spain's nuclear power plants. The massive quake was the strongest in recorded history to hit Japan, according to USGS records that date to 1900. CNN's Kyung Lah, Stan Grant, Jill Dougherty, Anderson Cooper, Kevin Voigt, Jiyeon Lee, Michael Martinez, Holly Yan and Sean Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: Britain joins the US in urging residents within 50 miles to evacuate .

1070,"(CNN) -- An American woman teaching English in Japan has been found dead, her family said Monday. Taylor Anderson, 24, had been missing since the tsunami struck earlier this month. She'd been teaching in Ishinomaki, Japan for the last three years, according to her parents. Ishinomaki, a city in Miyagi Prefecture, was hit hard by the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami. The disaster has killed more than 8,800 people and left close to 13,000 missing, many of them killed as a wall of water rushed in following the quake. ""We would like to thank all those whose prayers and support have carried us through this crisis. Please continue to pray for all who remain missing and for the people of Japan,"" her family said. The oldest of three children, Anderson was a native of Virginia. Her parents said she loved Japan, the culture and children. Some of her fellow teachers in Japan told CNN that Anderson hopped on her bike after the quake and likely tried to pedal home. The tsunami waters did not reach the school, though her home neighborhood was hit head on, they said. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell released a statement, offering his support for Anderson's family and friends. He said Anderson is the first American reported to have been killed in the natural disasters. ""Fittingly, she was last seen helping parents safely reunite with their children following the earthquake, an act which illustrates her dedication to her students and to the Japanese people she served,"" McDonnell said. ""Our thoughts and prayers remain with Taylor's family and friends during this difficult time."" CNN's Gary Tuchman and Devna Shukla contributed to this report .

1071,"(CNN) -- In a matter of minutes, a way of life disappeared in Hackleburg, Alabama. Three schools. A doctor's office. The pharmacy. A ballfield where children swang for the fences. The Wrangler plant that employed hundreds. A service station. All gone. But the cost from Wednesday's devastating storms was so much dearer. Twenty-nine people in the northwest Alabama town of nearly 1,600 residents died, according to Marion County Sheriff Kevin Williams. Sixteen died at the scene and 13 died at several hospitals, Williams said. ""It's been overwhelming at times,"" he said of the county's ordeal. Another six perished in the county seat of Hamilton, he said, making for a total of 35. Up to 400 people may have been hurt across Marion County, which borders Mississippi and has about 30,000 residents. The state's official update Friday night listed seven people as still missing in Marion County. Total fatalities for all of Alabama was 249. The storms -- which may have included two tornadoes -- roared along U.S. 43 and downtown, destroying almost every business in Hackleburg, officials said Friday. A trailer plant managed to survive, but up to 100 residences were destroyed. ""It's pretty much wiped out,"" Williams said of the city. ""It looks like a war zone."" A bank vault is being used to store medicine, now that the pharmacy is gone. Thirteen people were trapped in the Wrangler plant; one died. ""Everything is gone, and I am not exaggerating,"" said city Police Chief Kenny Hallmark, 40. But, officials said, there were blessings. The superintendent Wednesday decided to send students home. Assistance -- in the form of law enforcement, emergency crews and aid groups -- has poured in. And two members of the city's police department recently received homeland security training in Eufaula, Alabama. About 250 firefighters from the region logged in as volunteers, Williams said. Although there were shelters, townspeople were taking caring of their own, Hallmark told CNN. ""We have a small, close-knit community that takes care of each other, where we don't have to have shelters,"" Hallmark said. ""My house was in direct path and it is still standing,"" although it was damaged, he said. Others were not so fortunate. Most of the dead, Williams said, were found in residences. The incredibly powerful storms lifted a truck and deposited it four miles away, said Hallmark. For now, the city is digging out and trying to reassemble.

1072,"(CNN) -- With the official state death toll now at 337, the Wednesday through Thursday tornado outbreak is the second-deadliest single day for tornadoes since recordkeeping began, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. The outbreak is also on record as creating the most number of tornadoes in a single day. Records go back to 1680. Since then, there has been only one other date in U.S. history on which more people died during a severe weather outbreak, according to the National Weather Service. Weather officials say the reason why so many perished was due to the size and path of the tornadoes. Meteorologists rely on what is called an ""Enhanced Fujita Scale"" to rate the severity of tornadoes. The lowest ranking, EF0, applies to twisters with recorded 3-second wind gusts of 65 to 85 mph, according to the National Weather Service. The highest, an EF5, is assigned to tornadoes with speeds of more than 200 mph. The weather service has so far recorded 11 tornadoes with EF3 ratings or higher that struck central and north Alabama on Wednesday. Some of the twisters were three-quarters of a mile wide and traveled dozens of miles, experts said. ""That's an astounding amount for a single-day tornado event."" said Krissy Scotten, a weather service meteorologist in Birmingham, Alabama. ""It's one of those instances where you had very large tornadoes on very long tracks hitting heavily populated areas."" ""When you put that together, you're going to see large loss of life and massive devastation,"" Scotten said. According to the National Weather Service: . FATALITIES . -- The deadliest single day for tornadoes was on March 18, 1925, with 747 fatalities across seven states. -- As of Saturday morning, the Wednesday-Thursday outbreak has seen 337 fatalities across six states. -- The third-deadliest tornado outbreak was on March 21, 1932, when 332 people died. SEVERITY . --  An EF4 tornado that struck Pleasant Grove, Alabama, was produced by an astounding supercell thunderstorm that began in Newton County, Mississippi, and dissipated in Macon County, North Carolina. That supercell lasted 7 hours and 24 minutes and covered 380 miles, producing several strong to violent tornadoes along the way. -- The agency estimates that on Wednesday-Thursday, there were 211 tornadoes. -- The largest previous number of tornadoes on record in one event took place from April 3-4, 1974, with 148 tornadoes.

1073,"Smithville, Mississippi (CNN) -- Top federal officials voiced admiration and vowed cooperation Sunday after touring tornado-ravaged areas in Alabama and Mississippi, promising help to those who made it through this week's storms as they reconstruct their lives and communities. ""They're going to have to live and rebuild and recover,"" Craig Fugate, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said in Birmingham. ""Give them the respect that they're a survivor, not a victim."" Fugate was joined by several members of President Barack Obama's Cabinet, including heads of the departments of homeland security, agriculture, and housing and urban development. They saw destruction in Birmingham, then headed west to Smithville, Mississippi, where 15 of the town's less than 900 people perished due to the powerful twister. See photos of the devastation . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano explained that the group was diverse in order to best leverage the potential of the federal government, as it worked to help states, municipalities and ultimately individuals. She vowed that this effort will involve short-term fixes and a long-term committment in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee and other states hit the hardest. ""We will work (the affected) states as well, and those communities as well, to help them recover from this spring of storms -- and to come back strongly,"" Napolitano said. About 148 devastating twisters Wednesday left a wide swath of death and destruction across 13 states. The death toll had climbed to 339 Sunday, according to emergency management officials in six of those states. On Sunday, some of those killed were laid to rest while others attended religious services, hoping to make sense of the calamity. iReport pictures from Tuscaloosa area . A tornado demolished the Smithville Baptist Church in Mississippi. On Sunday, the church's pastor Wes White urged several hundred congregants gathered under a tent not to lose hope, but to turn to Jesus, in the days and weeks to come. ""We were changed. Our world will never be the same. This moment will forever be etched in the forefront of all our imaginations,"" White said. Hours later, the small town played host to Napolitano, Fugate and other members of the Obama administration. They noted that, despite the massive destruction, only 22 people are in shelters because most of those impacted were taken in by relatives, neighbors and fellow church members. This fact showed the strong community in Smithville and vicinity, but did not diminish the tremendous suffering and long-term challenges ahead, the officials said. Surgeon: 'I was just in shock' ""When the Piggly Wiggly is not open, it's real bad, folks,"" Fugate said. ""It don't get much worse ... This is going to be a tough recovery, but you are survivors. That's why we're here."" The administration officials said assistance will be offered -- and red tape circumvented -- to help with everything from patching roofs to aiding the local timber industry to rebuilding businesses. They urged those affected to phone FEMA at 1-800-621-3362 to get registered and learn about the process. In many communities, the struggle is daunting. Throughout Alabama -- the hardest-hit state -- the death toll Sunday morning was 250 and the number of injured was 2,219, emergency management officials said. Nearly a half million customers in the state remained without power. Tuscaloosa Mayor Walter Maddox said his city, where at least 39 people have died, faces a ""humanitarian crisis."" Hundreds of people remain unaccounted for and many more have been rendered homeless, he said. Horror and hope in Tuscaloosa . Rescuers and volunteers have descended on the area from near and far, canvassing neighborhoods looking for the missing and offering help to those who are staying near their devastated homes. ""We all got together and we wanted to help,"" Lorinda Rodriguez-Mitchell told CNN on Sunday from near Tuscaloosa, where she was coordinating the collection and distribution of items like diapers, cereal and water. ""We're just going down there to deliver food. Some people have been there 40, 50 years and they're not leaving."" In the Hispanic community, volunteer Martin Izaguirre said, many are afraid to go to shelters. He said some have told him, ""We are afraid we won't be welcomed in places where Spanish is not spoken."" While searchers fan out, some have taken a more high-tech approach. The University of Alabama's Crimson White student newspaper is trying to track down some of Tuscaloosa's missing using the #UAMissing hashtag on Twitter, said Hannah Mask, a former editor who has been working on the project. Hispanics struggle after storm . ""It's been really efficient,"" she said, noting that the list of those unaccounted for seems to be decreasing. Damage to larger Alabama cities such as Birmingham and Tuscaloosa may have been greater than the damage suffered by smaller towns, but rural areas will likely have a harder time recovering, Red Cross spokeswoman Anita Foster said. ""In terms of suffering, these people have lost their loved ones, they've lost their community. There are people who don't have home to return to,"" Foster said. She noted the sad response she received from one Hackleburg, Alabama, resident after asking her whether the town could recover. The woman simply shook her head, Foster said.

1074,"(CNN) -- The intentional breach of a levee on the Mississippi River is sending 396,000 cubic feet per second of water onto 200 square miles of fertile Missouri farmland. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the operation is helping to ease unprecedented flood pressure on other areas. While the plan appeared to be working -- the level of the Ohio River fell where it joins the Mississippi -- record crests and relentless pressure from millions of gallons of water still threatened communities throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. Vicksburg, Mississippi, could see water levels rise 4 feet by Sunday. Residents in Caruthersville, Missouri, were told sandbags may not be enough to control the water. Corina Jolley, of Sikeston, Missouri, told CNN she grew up in Dorena, Missouri, which she said was being inundated by the breach on the Mississippi River. A tombstone rests above the remains of her father and uncle, but ""I'm sure we'll never see it again,"" said Jolley, who claims residents of the rich farmland will be out of luck, as opposed to those in Cairo, Illinois, for whom the risk has been lessened by the breaches. ""Whoever thought it would be this bad?"" she said. The Corps reported river levels had fallen more than a foot since engineers detonated explosives late Monday night at Birds Point, Missouri, briefly illuminating the night sky like lightning and sending water coursing across a floodway that Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon described as ""literally the most productive part of our continent."" The Ohio River level had dropped about 1.7 feet at Cairo since Monday afternoon, before the blast, but that is expected to level off Wednesday and hover close to 60 feet the rest of the week. Other sections showed modest decreases or no changes Tuesday. Paducah, Kentucky, on the Ohio River, is expected to see levels go from 54.7 feet Tuesday night to 55.3 on Sunday. A second levee blast was conducted Tuesday afternoon at New Madrid, Missouri, and a third is planned Wednesday near Hickman, Kentucky. The second and third blasts, downstream of Birds Point, will allow floodwater to return to the Mississippi River. After the first blast late Monday, the National Weather Service lowered its crest projection for the Ohio River at Smithland, Kentucky -- upriver from the levee breach -- to 55 feet from the previous 58-foot prediction. But even that forecast is more than 3 1/2 feet higher than the record set at that location in 1997, according to weather service records. Flood stage there is 40 feet. The town of Cairo remained under a mandatory evacuation despite the intentional breach, while six other communities were under voluntary evacuation notices, said Patti Thompson, spokeswoman for the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. ""We're definitely not out of the woods yet,"" she said. ""The levees are all very saturated right now and they're going to continue to have a lot of pressure on them for several days."" Commercial shipping was affected by the levee blasting and subsequent debris removal. The segment at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, near Cairo, opened late Tuesday afternoon, said U.S. Coast Guard Cmdr. Claudia Gelzer. Two other Mississippi River sections along the Missouri-Kentucky border will reopen Wednesday or later, she said. Gelzer did not know how many vessels were affected, but said companies had prepared for the closings. The National Weather Service continues to predict record or near-record flooding in parts of southern Illinois, southwest Indiana, western Kentucky and Tennessee, southeastern Missouri, northeastern Arkansas and, later, parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh, commander of the Corps' Mississippi River Valley Division, made the decision to order the breach. He warned that without punching a hole in the levee, massive flooding would threaten to inundate communities throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. ""There's a tremendous amount of pressure on the system,"" he told reporters Tuesday evening. ""The project operated as designed."" It was a controversial decision. Missouri officials took the Corps to court over the plan, questioning the agency's authority to intentionally breach the levee. The state argued the floodwater would deposit silt on the 130,000-some acres, and years, along with millions of dollars, would be required to fix the damage. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene in the case on Sunday, clearing the way for Walsh's decision Monday to blow the levee. Some Missouri residents were angered, arguing the decision would destroy their communities and provide questionable benefit. But others felt the decision was for the best. ""Yeah, we lost 135,000 acres of farm land here in Missouri,"" said Sikeston, Missouri, resident Patricia Mobely, who recently fled the drought and firestorms of Texas for what she thought would be a more peaceful life in the Midwest. ""But how much more would we have lost if we hadn't done it?"" The river diversion and other flooding has had an impact on pets and livestock. Thirty-one animals rescued from flood waters in southeastern Missouri are heading to St. Louis, including 24 domestic rabbits found abandoned inside a cotton gin trailer, according to CNN affiliate KSDK. Walsh said the fate of Cairo was just one of many factors in his decision, saying he hoped the move would alleviate problems throughout the Mississippi River system. Water levels and flooding have hit record highs in many spots, putting severe strains on systems meant to prevent uncontrolled floods and the resulting loss of life and property. He called the decision to inundate the farmland and about 100 homes ""heart-wrenching."" ""I've been involved with flooding for 10 years and it takes a long time to recover from something like this,"" he said. The governors of Illinois and Missouri said authorities in both states were prepared for the blasts and subsequent flooding, according to prepared statements. ""I urge Missourians to continue to cooperate fully with state, county and local law enforcement, as they have at every stage of this process,"" Nixon said. ""Together, we will ensure that Missouri families stay safe in the coming days. And together, we will recover and rebuild."" A statement released by Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn's office called the decision to breach the levee ""an important step to ensure public safety as we respond to this crisis."" Even as the river was falling, Walsh did not rule out similar moves elsewhere along the Mississippi and its tributaries, saying the levee system is under unprecedented pressure and warning water levels could rise again. ""This doesn't end this historic flood,"" he said. Evacuation notices have been posted in Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, where rising tributaries have threatened dozens of communities. Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear visited three counties to assess response efforts. Nearly 4,000 residents in the cities of Smithland, Hickman and Ledbetter have been evacuated, according to a statement from his office. Counties in central and northeast Arkansas were affected, including areas along the Black and White rivers, said spokesman Tommy Jackson of the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management. The mayor of Dyersburg, Tennessee, urged residents of parts of his community to evacuate ahead of significant flooding there forecast for Wednesday night, and residents and officials in Paducah, Kentucky, were closely watching a levee holding back the Ohio River that has showed signs of failing. ""We are in uncharted water,"" Paducah Mayor Bill Paxton said. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","NEW: Animals rescued in southeast Missouri .

1075,"(CNN) -- Australia showed no mercy for earthquake-hit neighbors New Zealand as a fine bowling display earned the defending champions a seven-wicket victory at the 2011 Cricket World Cup in Nagpur on Friday. A minute's silence was observed before the match to honor the victims of Tuesday's quake in Christchurch, which has left more than 110 people dead, and both teams -- wearing black armbands -- huddled together in a display of solidarity. But once the action began, the Kiwis struggled to perform after losing the toss and being sent into bat. When Ross Taylor became Shaun Tait's third victim with the last ball of the 17th over, New Zealand had collapsed to 73-6. New Zealand death toll rises . Nathan McCullum showed some resistance with 52 off 76 balls, and captain Daniel Vettori hit a lusty 44 off 43 deliveries, but the Black Caps could bat only 45.1 of their allotted 50 overs to be all out for a disappointing 206. Left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Johnson was the pick of the Australian bowlers with figures of 4-33 off 9.1 overs, while Tait took 3-35 from seven overs. Australia, seeking a fourth successive title and fifth overall, then made light work of the run chase to clinch a second win from two Group A games -- and 25th in a row at the four-yearly tournament. Openers Shane Watson (62) and Brad Haddin (55) put on 133 in just 18 overs, while vice-captain Michael Clarke (24) and Cameron White (22) were unbeaten as they came home with 16 overs to spare -- helped by a sloppy 29 wides from the New Zealand bowlers. Vettori said the tragic events back home could not be used as an excuse for his team's poor performance. ""It would be unfair to the people who are going through a lot worse than we are over here to say that was the reason we didn't play very well today. We're professional sportsmen and we have to get up for these games,"" he told reporters in quotes carried by the AFP agency. Australia fast bowler Doug Bollinger has been ruled out for the rest of the tournament, having also missed the opening win over Zimbabwe after suffering an ankle injury in a warm-up match. West Indies all-rounder Dwayne Bravo will be out for four weeks after suffering a similar problem in Thursday's defeat by South Africa, ending his participation unless his team reach the semifinals. In Friday's Group B action, Bangladesh survived a big scare before avoiding a second consecutive defeat, beating Ireland by 27 runs in Dhaka. Bangladesh, beaten by co-hosts India in the opening game of the tournament, were bowled out for just 205 in the final over despite making a roaring start on a slow pitch. Opener Tamim Iqbal top-scored with 44 off 43 balls but after he was third man out with the total at 68 in the 12th over, captain Mushfiqur Rahim (36) and Raqibul Hasan (38) played patient innings to steady proceedings. However, South Africa-born Andre Botha (3-32), left-arm spinner George Dockrell (2-23) and Australia-born Trent Johnston (2-40) combined to give the Irish hope of repeating their win over Bangladesh at the 2007 World Cup. And the run chase was looking good at 151-5, but then Kevin O'Brien (37) became the first of four victims for young fast bowler Shafiul Islam in the 37th over as the last six wickets fell for just 27 runs. On Saturday, Sri Lanka, the third of the tournament's hosts, take on Pakistan in a Group A match in Colombo. Both teams won their opening matches.","Cricket World Cup champions Australia cruise to victory against New Zealand .

1077,"Tokyo (CNN) -- The bodies of two Japanese nuclear power plant workers missing since the epic March 11 earthquake and tsunami have been found, an official with the plant's owner said Sunday. The men's remains were found in the basement of the turbine building at the No. 4 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, an official with the Tokyo Electric Power Company told reporters Sunday. The pair -- identified as Kazahiko Kokubo, 24, and Yoshiki Terashima, 21, both members of the utility company's operations management department -- were working in that building when the 9.0-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck. The disaster caused damage throughout northeastern Japan, including at the power plant, which is on the Asian nation's eastern coast about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. One of the workers was found floating in a pool of water in the basement, the utilty company official said. Both appeared to have suffered multiple traumatic injuries and severe blood loss. The bodies were found Wednesday, but the power company did not disclose the news until late Sunday morning. Tokyo Electric officials explained the information was delayed in getting out because it took time to notify victims' families and discuss how to announce the news. Company Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata offered condolences for ""the loss of two valuable lives."" ""It is deeply regrettable that we lose two employees who were trying to protect the safety of the power plant from the earthquake and tsunami,"" he said in a statement. Later, Katsumata reiterated Tokyo Electric's vow that every effort is being made to address the crisis at the nuclear plant and this such a situation will never happen again. ""We swear never to repeat this tragedy,"" he said, ""and we making a full effort to resolve the situation as soon as possible.""

1078,"(CNN) -- Floods have devastated the landscape of the state of Queensland, Australia, but they also present a high risk to the Great Barrier Reef. Stretching over 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles) along the northeast coast of Australia, large parts of the southern Great Barrier Reef are ""flooded"" with fresh water. Currently the biggest plumes of fresh water reach about 200 kilometers (124 miles) north from the mouths of the Fitzroy and Burnett Rivers, and stretch around 70 kilometers (43 miles) off the coast. ""These are extraordinary events. The whole of the inner-shore reef lagoon filled with river water,"" says Jon Brodie, Principle Researcher for the James Cook University's Australian Center for Tropical Freshwater Research. Brodie and his team regularly monitor the reefs and are immersed in studying the impact of the flood waters. Brodie describes the threat to many coral reefs closest to the flooding rivers as ""quite high"" but expects the flood waters to affect in some way the reefs stretching from Frazer Island, 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Brisbane, all the way to Cairns, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) away. The prevailing tides and south easterly winds mean the flood waters will probably continue to head north. ""It's quite remarkable to see. If you were to snorkel where the flood water meets the seawater and look to one side, the sea water will be clear with visibility to 50 meters while the other side is fresh, dirty brown water where visibility is down to one meter,"" says Brodie. The mix of nutrients, sediment and pesticides from agricultural run-off, plus currently unknown amounts of trace metals from flooded mines, will likely have an immediately devastating impact on corals and sea grasses, says Brodie. Salinity could go down to ten parts per thousand or less and remain like that for weeks; ""nothing can live in those conditions,"" says Brodie. The immediate death of corals and sea grass is expected, which could then have a devastating affect on other marine creatures like dugongs that feed on sea grass. When the Fitzroy River (that flooded Rockhampton before Christmas) suffered severe flooding in 1991, the corals and sea grasses around the Keppel Islands suffered 100 percent coral mortality. Bigger fishes can swim away from the deluge of fresh water, but smaller coral reef fish may suffer the same fate as the corals they live around, says Brodie. While corals can recover from ""bleaching"" (when coral organisms die leaving what looks like a white skeletal structure), it's a slow process. Some recovery around the Keppel Islands was seen after 10 years, while other coral species and marine organisms were still recovering until the latest floods. Other marine species can actually benefit from floods. ""Some fish species thrive in the current flood plume conditions which can enhance productivity for some popular inshore species,"" Andrew Skeat, General Manager of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said in a press statement. Other unwanted long term effects can be algae blooms which can upset the reef ecosystems. ""It will take some time before the impacts of these flood plumes on the marine ecosystem and on the industries that use these areas are known,"" said Skeat. Climate scientists have blamed the excessive rainfall the region has seen in the last month on the latest La Niña weather event. La Niña refers to the cooling of the central and eastern Pacific that drives wetter conditions in eastern Australia. Brodie agrees with the cause of the heavy rain: ""It was predicted. It certainly fits the pattern of severe weather events from climate change modeling."" Queensland suffered its wettest ever December, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, during what it describes as a ""very strong"" La Niña event in the Pacific Ocean. In June 2010 the bureau stated that La Niña was likely to have an affect on Australia by the end of that year. A previous La Niña event happened in 1974 when a record flood of the Brisbane River killed 14 people.","Flood water will have devastating affect on corals and sea grass in parts of Great Barrier Reef .

1079,"(CNN) -- Security concerns forced two U.S. passenger flights to be diverted Sunday, but both planes landed safely and eventually flew to their final destinations. A Continental flight bound for Chicago from Houston made an unscheduled stop in St. Louis because of an ""unruly passenger,"" a St. Louis airport spokesman said Sunday. The man tried to reach the exit door during the flight, but was stopped by a flight attendant, spokesman Jeff Lea said. The plane landed at St. Louis and the man was taken off the plane for questioning by airport police and federal authories, he said. Continental Flight 546 finally landed in Chicago Sunday afternoon just an hour late. A Delta flight was diverted Sunday after a flight attendant found a suspicious note in a lavatory, an official with the Transportation Security Administration told CNN. The flight from Detroit headed to San Diego was diverted to Albuquerque, New Mexico, the FBI said, adding that it was informed of ""a potential security threat"" on the plane. Flight 1706 landed in Albuquerque shortly before 10 a.m. (12 p.m. ET) and agents were on the scene to investigate, the FBI office in Albuquerque said. A spokesman for Albuquerque International Sunport Airport said passengers deplaned and were ""being checked out."" TSA spokeswoman Kristin Lee said the flight landed without incident, and that all passengers deplaned safely. ""Passengers and carry-ons were cleared by a canine team, and the plane was swept with negative findings,"" a TSA statement said. CNN's Stephanie Gallman and Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Unruly passenger"" forces Continental flight diversion .

1080,"(CNN) -- Investigators checked cameras at California-Mexico border crossings Monday in their search for a driver who is believed to have caused a weekend crash that killed five people on a California desert highway. A Dodge Avenger struck a group of 12 motorcycles Saturday on a highway in El Centro, Imperial County, just east of San Diego, after swerving to avoid a gold Honda Civic that had just passed the bikers. Four people on the bikes and a passenger in the Dodge Avenger died on the scene, California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Deeann Goudie said.  Six other motorcyclists were seriously injured. ""The gold Honda Civic left the scene without stopping and police want to talk with that driver,"" Goudie said. ""We're looking for a 1995-2000 model year Gold Honda Civic."" Police suspect the Honda driver may have fled across the nearby border into Mexico, prompting them to take a look at the border camera video, according to another California Highway Patrol spokesman, Pablo Torrez. A drunk driving charge that was initially made against the Dodge Avenger driver was dropped Monday after blood test results came back negative, Torrez said. The bikers are part of the Saddle Tramps Motorcycle group in Lakeside, California. They were taking a casual ride on their Harley Davidsons to celebrate the group's 10th anniversary. Anyone with information is asked to contact the California Highway Patrol. CNN's Rick Martin and Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","NEW: Border cameras may help police find the driver who fled the scene .

1081,"(CNN) -- Heavy rains and flooding in Brazil have caused 260 deaths in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, CNN affiliate TV Record reported Wednesday. The greatest damage was in a cluster of towns in a mountainous area northeast of the city of Rio from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning, where civil defense officials said 147 lost their lives. That included 114 people reported killed in Teresopolis by a mudslide, local officials told CNN. Some 1,000 others were left without shelter and were being moved to a local gym and schools. And, in nearby Petropolis, 18 deaths were recorded, the state government said, according to Agencia Brasil. Three deaths were reported in Itaipava, while in Nova Friburgo there were 12. Among the victims in Rio state were three firefighters who were involved in rescue operations when they were buried by a subsequent mudslide, Agencia Brasil reported. A fourth firefighter was missing. Nearly 75,000 people were without power in the region as a result of the heavy storms. Teresopolis Mayor Jorge Mario Sedlacek declared his city a natural disaster area. He told CNN affiliate TV Globo that at least 80 rescuers have been sent to the region. Meanwhile, in the state of Sao Paulo, at least 24 people were dead as heavy rain continued to batter parts of the state, authorities said. It has been raining since January 1, and the deluge could continue until the end of the week, forecasters have said. The flooding has caused mudslides, officials said Tuesday. The Mairipora Dam gave way, adding to the woes in the area, said Ramos Junior, a captain at the Sao Paulo Civil Fire Department. Sao Jose dos Campos, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the city of Sao Paulo, has been hardest hit by the flooding, Junior said. In January last year, heavy rains caused dozens of deaths in Brazil's southeast coast. Torrential rains caused deadly mudslides in the resort area of the town of Angra dos Reis.

1082,"(CNN) -- The intentional breach of a levee on the Mississippi River is helping to ease unprecedented flood pressure on other areas, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said. The Ohio River level had dropped about 1.7 feet at Cairo, Illinois, since Monday afternoon, before the blast, but that is expected to level off Wednesday. The breach, created when engineers detonated explosives late Monday night at Birds Point, Missouri, is sending 396,000 cubic feet of water per second onto 200 square miles of fertile Missouri farmland. The water is coursing across a floodway that Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon described as ""literally the most productive part of our continent."" Two states grapple with rising floodwaters . Farmer Bryan Feezor said the sight makes you ""sick to your stomach"" as he surveyed his submerged fields. ""Farming is all I ever have done ... and it's under water,"" he told CNN affiliate KPLR. ""I really don't know (what I'm going to do)."" A second levee blast was conducted Tuesday afternoon at New Madrid, Missouri, and a third is planned Wednesday near Hickman, Kentucky. The second and third blasts, downstream of Birds Point, will allow floodwater to return to the Mississippi River. While the plan appeared to be working -- the level of the Ohio River fell where it joins the Mississippi -- record crests and relentless pressure from millions of gallons of water still threatened communities throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. Vicksburg, Mississippi, could see water levels rise 4 feet by Sunday. Authorities told residents of Caruthersville, Missouri, that sandbags may not be enough to control the water. Corina Jolley, of Sikeston, Missouri, said she grew up in Dorena, Missouri, which she said was being inundated by the breach on the Mississippi River. A tombstone rests above the remains of her father and uncle, but ""I'm sure we'll never see it again,"" said Jolley, who said residents of the rich farmland will be out of luck, as opposed to those in Cairo, for whom the risk has been lessened by the breaches. ""Whoever thought it would be this bad?"" she said. The situation was especially perilous for a 93-year-old woman who was caught in the swollen waters of the Black River near Poplar Bluff, Missouri, where two members of the Missouri National Guard rescued her from a partially submerged car. ""We weren't there to be heroes,"" said Sgt. Tim Bridges. ""We were just doing our jobs."" Bridges, along with Spc. Junior Bombard, waded through the rushing, muddy waters to ferry the woman to safety. This ""is the reason why I signed up for the Guard,"" said Spc. Junior Bombard. The town of Cairo remained under a mandatory evacuation despite the intentional breach, while six other communities were under voluntary evacuation notices, said Patti Thompson, spokeswoman for the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. ""We're definitely not out of the woods yet,"" she said. ""The levees are all very saturated right now and they're going to continue to have a lot of pressure on them for several days."" Even with the levee breach, the National Weather Service continues to predict record or near-record flooding in parts of southern Illinois, southwest Indiana, western Kentucky and Tennessee, southeastern Missouri, northeastern Arkansas, and parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh, commander of the Corps' Mississippi River Valley Division, made the decision to order the breach. He warned that without punching a hole in the levee, massive flooding would threaten to inundate communities throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. ""There's a tremendous amount of pressure on the system,"" he told reporters Tuesday evening. ""The project operated as designed."" It was a controversial decision. Missouri officials took the Corps to court over the plan, questioning the agency's authority to intentionally breach the levee. The state argued the floodwater would deposit silt on the estimated  130,000 acres, and years, along with millions of dollars, would be required to fix the damage. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene in the case on Sunday, clearing the way for Walsh to blow the levee. Some Missouri residents were angered by the decision, saying it would destroy their communities and provide questionable benefit. But others felt the decision was for the best. ""Yeah, we lost ... acres of farm land here in Missouri,"" said Sikeston, Missouri, resident Patricia Mobely, who recently fled the drought and firestorms of Texas for what she thought would be a more peaceful life in the Midwest. ""But how much more would we have lost if we hadn't done it?"" ""The sacrifice that these people are making is for the greater good,"" Jim Pogue with the Army Corps of Engineers told KPLR. ""Their sacrifices are going to benefit hundreds of thousands of people all through this region. It's not just Cairo. It's people all through this part of the country."" Walsh called the decision to inundate the farmland and about 100 homes ""heart-wrenching."" ""I've been involved with flooding for 10 years and it takes a long time to recover from something like this,"" he said. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Farmer says the sight of his submerged farm makes you ""sick to your stomach""

1083,"Atlanta (CNN) -- One of the world's largest concrete pumps is being readied to get on a massive cargo plane and head to Japan, all part of the effort to address the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The 190,000-pound truck pump was moved off a job on the Savannah River on Wednesday and, two days later, was in Hanahan, South Carolina. Once preparations are complete, it will head about 7,000 miles toward Asia aboard a Russian Antonov 225 cargo plane, which is considered among the world's biggest aircraft. The U.S. Department of Energy had been using the big pumper at a mixed oxide fuel plant construction site in southeastern Georgia. Eventually, nuclear waste is to be disposed of here. But the decision was made to transfer it to Japan -- along with several other such large pumps, from around the world -- in order to deal with a disaster that has been brewing since a March 11 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc at the plant and stoked fears about massive releases of radiation. ""I use the pump every day at the river site, but they're trying to avert a situation that worsens each day,"" said Jerry Ashmore, the owner of Ashmore Concrete Contractors that supplies concrete for the Savannah River facility. ""They need all this equipment. They need help."" Company officials say the prep work should be done by this weekend. Then, Georgia's transportation department must sign off on necessary highway and bridge permits, which are required due to the pumper truck's immense size. Eventually, it will be driven west to Atlanta, to be ideally flown out of the country by next Friday. Ashmore didn't have all the details about how the concrete pump will be used once it gets to Japan, though he understood its first mission will be to pump water to prevent overheating and the further emission of radioactive material. ""I understand it will be used to pump water into the reactor and later they can use it for concrete operations that need to be done,"" said Ashmore. The big pump, one of a handful of such trucks built by the German company Putzmeister, appears to be tailor-made for this type of project -- especially in a radioactive environment. And this is not the first-time the company's large concrete pumps have been utilized to help address a nuclear crisis. In 1986, 11 Putzmeister concrete pumps were used after the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine, then a part of the Soviet Union. The reactors' core were encased in massive amounts of concrete, to prevent the further release of any more radiation. For weeks, similar concrete pump engines have been used at the embattled power plant, as a conduit for water going into reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools. But the new pumps, like the one from the Savannah River site, have the advantage of being appreciably larger, making them potentially more useful for spraying water or a possible end-game scenario involving encasing nuclear reactor cores in concrete. Its 70-meter boom can be controlled remotely, which should allow it to disperse cooling water in pinpointed locations over a large distance, say experts. Typically trucks this massive are used in large projects using concrete, such as the construction of bridges or high-rise buildings. According to Putzmeister's website, the company has already re-directed a truck-mounted concrete pump from an unknown location in Southeast Asia to head to the Fukushima Daiichi site, which is 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Another smaller Putzmeister pumper, currently in Los Angeles, is also being readied to fly to Japan.","A 190,000-pound truck pump is now in South Carolina, being prepped to fly out of Atlanta .

1084,"(CNN) -- Volunteers and veterinarians caring round the clock for stranded pilot whales were buoyed Saturday evening by news that two were released off the Florida Keys. After being transported by boat, the males swam away in the Atlantic Ocean about nine miles off the lower Florida Keys shortly before 6 p.m., said Karrie Carnes, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokeswoman. The pair are 12 feet and 13 feet long and weigh more than 1,000 pounds each. They are considered teenagers. Five other surviving pilot whales are being cared for in a sea pen established at Cudjoe Key, about 20 miles east of Key West. ""They (the whales) are being literally cradled 24 hours a day,"" Carnes said. Fourteen whales died after stranding themselves in shallow waters over a 12-mile stretch of sand flats. Veterinarians are not sure why the protected whales came to shore, said Carnes, adding that they are usually found in 300-meter deep waters in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. ""We may never know why this group stranded."" The pod showed no evident signs of significant emaciation or illness, but may have become disoriented and followed each other to the shore. ""They are very social animals,"" Carnes said. The rescue effort, which began Thursday, has included hundreds of federal and state employees, veterinarians and volunteers, said Carnes, who works at the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Rescuers plan to transfer the five survivors to a rehabilitation facility in Key Largo once they are healthy enough to undergo the journey, Carnes told CNN. Tents and wet sheets are protecting the five from the sun and temperatures. Veterinarians are checking their blood and body fluids and are pumping them with antibiotics and enzymes. Volunteers from the Marine Mammal Conservancy in Key Largo have been crucial to the operation. ""For a lot of people, marine animals are very charismatic,"" Carnes said. ""People have a love of the ocean and mysteries of the deep."" Sea World, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also have provided assistance in the lifesaving effort. Adult pilot whales can measure up to 20 feet long and weigh up to 3 tons. Due to their social nature, they are often involved in mass strandings, according to the American Cetacean Society. The ACS is a nonprofit group based in California that works to protect whales, dolphins and porpoises, according to its website. A similar incident occurred in the Florida Keys in 2003, when 28 whales were stranded. Most of them died, but after several months of care, five were released back into the ocean. CNN's Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.","Two male pilot whales are released in the Atlantic Ocean off the Florida Keys .

1085,"(CNN) -- Two U.S. Border Patrol agents who were assisting in the apprehension of suspected illegal immigrants were killed Thursday when their vehicle was struck by a train, officials said. They were driving an unmarked Border Patrol vehicle when it was struck by a 90-car freight train at a crossing about nine miles west of Gila Bend, Arizona, the agency said. Authorities were investigating what caused the accident that killed Border Patrol Agents Eduardo Rojas Jr. and Hector Clark, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a statement. The vehicle, an SUV, was struck by the train at the rail crossing of Paloma Road near exit 106 of Interstate 8. ""This is unfortunate not just for me, not just for the Yuma Sector, but for the Border Patrol as a whole,"" Border Patrol spokesman Kenneth Quillin said. The agents were on duty and were assisting other officers in tracking down a group of people suspected to have entered the country illegally, Quillin said. The agents were trying to position themselves north of where the other agents were, he said. Both Clark, 39, and Rojas, 35, were lead agents in the Border Patrol's Yuma Sector, the agency said. Rojas, who had been working with the patrol for more than 11 years, is survived by his wife and two children. Clark, who had been working with the patrol for nearly 10 years, also is survived by his wife and two children. ""This tragedy is a reminder to all of us that whether they are facing down a criminal suspect with a weapon, or patrolling the highways and deserts, these law enforcement professionals encounter life-threatening dangers every day,"" Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne said. Napolitano noted the service of others as she expressed sympathy for the victims and their families. ""We also keep in our thoughts and prayers all of those who put their lives at risk every day, at home and abroad, to defend our country. We honor their service and pray for their continued safety,"" she said. On Friday, a Mexican man was arraigned in a U.S. federal court for the killing last December of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in Arizona.

1086,"Paris (CNN) -- French air accident investigators probing a mysterious crash that killed 228 people will not bring more bodies up from the Atlantic Ocean if they cannot identify the two they already have, they said Thursday. Those two bodies are being examined to see if there is enough DNA to identify them, investigators said, adding that they hope to have results by Wednesday. If they can identify the remains, they will consider bringing up other bodies from the wreckage of Air France flight 447, which crashed nearly two years ago off the coast of Brazil. Only about 50 bodies were recovered in the aftermath of the crash. The bulk of the wreckage was located earlier this year and contains many more human remains, investigators say. Recovering more bodies will be a difficult task, with miles of cable required to bring each one up over a period of three hours, they said. Relatives of the victims are divided on whether they should be left in place or brought to the surface. Experts trying to figure out why the plane crashed expect to know Monday whether they will be able to recover information from data recorders found at the bottom of the ocean, they said Thursday. The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were found almost two weeks ago after an unprecedented series of submarine searches of a mountain range 3,900 meters (12,700 feet) under the ocean. They were brought to the surface and taken to Paris by ship and plane. Over the next several days, their protective casing will be removed, salt will be cleaned off, and the recorders will be left out to dry, investigators told journalists in Paris Thursday. Once they are dry, any further salt residue will be removed. Investigators will assess the recorders visually, then check the state of the memory cards and finally make a back-up of the cards. This could take up to three days, they said. Only then they will begin to analyze what is on the recorders, they added. Investigators also brought an engine and an avionics bay containing computers to the surface Monday, they said . The pilots of Air France 447 lost contact with air traffic controllers on June 1, 2009, while flying across an area of the Atlantic known for severe turbulence, officials said. But exactly what caused the plane to plunge into the ocean remains a mystery. The plane belly-flopped into the water while en route from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, falling so fast that air masks did not have time to deploy. The fuselage was discovered in April with bodies still inside, investigators said. A first body was recovered May 3, still buckled into its seat, days after the data recorders were found, the French Interior Ministry said. The body ""appeared degraded,"" the ministry added in a written statement. Another body was brought up two days later. ""The attempts to bring up the bodies were made in particularly complex conditions. Considerable uncertainties still remain regarding the technical feasibility of recovering the bodies,"" the Interior Ministry statement said. DNA samples from the remains will be sent to a laboratory for analysis, the statement added. Some relatives of those who died have expressed reservations about remains being brought to the surface. Last month Robert Soulas, head of a support group for families of flight victims, said: ""For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed."" Other relatives have called for the bodies to be recovered. France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said last week that the external casings of both the flight recorders -- which record data and cockpit voices -- were in good condition and that they had started a ""drying"" process. Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the Paris-based BEA, said at the time that even if there was some internal damage to the recorders, some data might still be recoverable. ""We must be very very careful... we are confident but it will take time for us to know whether we can retrieve all the data."" But Phil Seymour, chief operating officer of the International Bureau of Aviation, a British aviation consultancy, said: ""I remain skeptical about how useful this device (memory unit) will be. If you were to throw a computer into the ocean, imagine how all the parts would eventually split up. You also have the corrosive effects of seawater and the immense depths involved.""

1087,"Washington (CNN) -- Another air traffic controller apparently fell asleep while on duty, a problem that is prompting the government to put an extra staffer on midnight shifts at more than two dozen control towers across the country. The latest incident occurred Wednesday morning at Reno-Tahoe International Airport in Nevada ""when a controller fell asleep while a medical flight carrying an ill patient was trying to land,"" the Federal Aviation Administration said. The flight originated in Mammoth Lakes, California, according to the FAA Pacific Division. ""The medical flight pilot was in communication with the Northern California Terminal Radar Approach Control and landed safely. The controller, who was out of communication for approximately 16 minutes, has been suspended while the FAA investigates,"" the FAA said in a statement. FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt expressed outrage, saying ""we absolutely cannot and will not tolerate sleeping on the job. This type of unprofessional behavior does not meet our high safety standards."" ""This is absolutely unacceptable,"" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. It would be the sixth incident this year involving a sleeping controller that the FAA has disclosed. One occurred at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, another at McGhee Tyson Airport in Knoxville, Tennessee, and three incidents involving the same person occurred at Boeing Field/King County International Airport in Seattle. The FAA said it also suspended two controllers in Lubbock, Texas, for an incident in the early hours of March 29 in which they failed to hand off control of a departing flight to the Fort Worth Air Traffic Control Center, and responded only after several attempts by the same center to hand them control of an arriving flight. The FAA statement did not indicate whether the Lubbock controllers were thought to have been asleep. Babbitt and LaHood said the FAA will assign an extra air traffic controller on the midnight shift at 27 control towers staffed with only one controller during that time. The FAA said Babbitt and National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Paul Rinaldi ""are launching a nationwide 'Call to Action' on air traffic control safety and professionalism"" and will visit air traffic facilities to underscore the need for safety and professionalism. The move will include ""an independent review of the FAA's air traffic control training curriculum and qualifications and the expansion of NATCA's Professional Standards committees."" The FAA is also reviewing staffing and scheduling. Nevada's senior senator, Harry Reid, said it was ""a miracle that everyone is OK. We're glad that they are."" ""Last night's near-tragedy reminds us that state-of-the-art structures and the best technology work only as well as the people operating them,"" Reid said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""If those people fall asleep on the job, they risk the lives of the millions of Americans who fly into and out of our airports every day."" Krys Bart, president of Reno-Tahoe International Airport, said the pilot of the Sierra Life Flight plane -- a Piper Cheyenne twin turboprop -- tried to make contact with the Reno tower at about 2 a.m., but got no response and began to circle the airport. After repeated failed attempts to reach someone in the tower, the pilot evaluated the situation and decided to land. In his remarks on Capitol Hill, Reid said the pilot ""tried to call the tower not once or twice, but seven times. The controller slept through every one of those calls."" A federal government source on Wednesday confirmed to CNN the figure of seven attempted calls to the tower. Bart said it is her understanding that there was only one controller on duty at the time. She added that she is pleased with the FAA's response, and issued a statement to clarify that air traffic control staffing is entirely in the federal agency's domain: . ""We have a brand-new, state-of-the-art air traffic control tower, three runways and two instrument landing systems in place to help guide pilots on landing, take-off and ground control,"" Bart's statement said. ""But what the airport has no control over is the staffing levels and personnel in the control tower. ... this is an FAA issue, the Airport Authority does not control what happens in the air traffic control tower."" However, Republican Rep. John L. Mica, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said the move to increase tower staffing ""misdirects our resources and focus away from congested air traffic control facilities."" ""Only in the federal government would you double up on workers, averaging $161,000 per year in salary and benefits, that aren't doing their job,"" the Florida congressman said. Mica and other committee leaders plan to meet with FAA officials behind closed doors to discuss what his office described as ""a spate of near misses, runway incursions and incidents of sleeping on the job.""

1088,"(CNN) -- Tuesday's fourth stage of the Giro d'Italia was turned into a tribute to tragic Belgian Wouter Weylandt, who died in a horror crash during Monday's third stage. The 26-year-old Weylandt, who suffered a fatal accident on the descent of the Bocco climb, was honored by the peloton who refused to race the entire 216km stage from Genoa to Livorno -- effectively neutralizing the stage. Before the stage, the peloton held a minute's silence for Weylandt, and along the route the streets were packed with people paying their respects to the rider, who had won the corresponding stage of last year's Giro. Team Leopard rider Weylandt dies in Giro d'Italia crash . Leopard-Trek's remaining eight-man squad came over the finish line together, accompanied by Garmin rider Tyler Farrar, a training partner and close friend of Weylandt. And Farrar issued a statement saying: ""I am unbearably saddened by the loss of Wouter. As many know, he was my friend, training partner, and in many ways, another brother to me. ""His death marks an irreparable change in my life but more importantly, in the lives of his family and most loved. ""I can only convey my deepest of sympathies to everyone who cared about him as deeply as I did, especially his family, his friends, his team and his fans -- we celebrate his life and mourn his death in equal measure."" Farrar, who lived near to Weylandt in the Belgian city of Ghent, had already decided to leave the race following his friend's death and, late on Tuesday evening, the remaining Leopard-Trek riders also issued a statement saying they too were withdrawing from the race. ""The decision really needed to be taken by the riders, because they are the ones that participate in the race,"" said Leopard team manager Brian Nygaard. ""We have always said that we would stand behind their choice. We wish to thank the other teams, the race organization, the Italian authorities and all the fans on the road between Genova and Livorno on today's stage, as the peloton paid tribute to Wouter."" Team captain Fabian Wegmann explained the teams' decision. ""We have a lot of respect for the Giro d'Italia and for cycling, but we simply cannot continue racing given the circumstances. We are professional athletes, but we feel this is the right thing to do."" After many riders had expressed their sadness in an outpouring of emotion on Twitter, the peloton agreed to award all prize money from Tuesday's stage to Weylandt's family. Weylandt's partner Anne-Sophie -- who will give birth to the couple's first child in September -- also laid flowers at the scene of the tragedy, before traveling with Weylandt's parents to the hospital morgue in Lavagna, where his body is being held. Meanwhile, pathologist Armando Mannucci told the Ansa news agency that Weylandt had ""died instantly and did not suffer"" after carrying out a two-and-a-half hour autopsy on the his body. Dr. Mannucci concluded that Weylandt suffered fatal skull and facial injuries as well as damage to his pelvis and a broken leg after the accident -- which is believed to have occurred when the rider's left pedal briefly touched a wall at the side of the road, propelling him 20 meters to the ground below where he landed heavily on his face. Racing will resume in Wednesday's fifth stage, a 191km ride from Piombino to Orvieto, with Briton David Millar holding the race leader's pink jersey.","Tuesday's fourth stage of the Giro d'Italia is turned into a tribute to Wouter Weylandt .

1090,"Sendai, Japan (CNN) -- Long lines at grocery stores and gas stations along with continued aftershocks and power outages greeted many in Japan on Sunday morning, nearly two days after the devastating earthquake and tsunami that left hundreds dead and missing. Supplies of food and gas were running out in Sendai, the northern coastal city close to the epicenter of Friday's quake. Those who survived the earthquake and chose to remain in the city were enduring two-hour waits at the supermarket, according to a CNN iReporter in Sendai with the username joeyjenkins. ""They have waited for I don't even know how long to get gas, as the gas station manually pumps the gas since there is no electricity,"" joeyjenkins wrote, adding they were without power until early Sunday. Schools and hospitals and Sendai have been turned into shelters, and volunteers were handing out bottles of water, CNN correspondent Kyung Lah reported from the city. Fears of power outages in Tokyo, about 200 miles south, sparked a run on flashlights, said iReporter Jessica Tekawa, 26. ""I think last night, there must have been something on the news about a power outage,"" she told CNN, ""because when we went, with my friend, we were trying to get flashlights and they were sold out everywhere."" Water, too, was sold out in every store she went to after similar reports of possible water contamination, she said. Kenneth Cukier, the Japan correspondent for The Economist magazine, said the government announced managed power cuts will start Monday in certain regions of the country -- including suburban areas of Tokyo -- to give businesses enough power to operate. A seemingly endless barrage of aftershocks from Friday's 8.9-magnitude quake was still rattling nerves Sunday. The U.S. Geological Survey reported more than 140 such quakes -- magnitude 4.5 and higher, with the strongest coming at a 6.4 -- in, near, or off the east coast of the Japanese island. There have been ""many aftershocks,"" said Yasue Schumaker, a Sendai native who now lives in Hawaii, but was visiting her mother in a Sendai hospital when the quake struck. ""The day it happened, it was constantly aftershock, and last night was better, but still we are having quite big ones,"" Schumaker said. The aftershocks are a ""constant reminder of what's happened, and what could happen in the future,"" Wall Street Journal reporter Yoree Koh told CNN from Tokyo. Such aftershocks are also producing tremendous anxiety for earthquake survivors, reported CNN's Gary Tuchman, driving from the western coastal city of Shonai to Sendai in the east. ""People are wondering, could there be an aftershock that's greater than the original earthquake?"" Tuchman said. ""Each time you feel it, there's an element of fear."" The Japanese military was working in at least one neighborhood of Sendai on Sunday morning to search for anyone trapped in the rubble. ""A few hundred"" people were still unaccounted for in one part of town Sunday, Lah reported. Search-and-rescue helicopters buzzed over Sendai as workers walked through the muddy streets wearing hard hats and carrying shovels. At least one person was winched by chopper from a damaged house. The city was still littered with debris and standing water from the tsunami. Two to three miles inland, houses were destroyed or simply gone, cars were stacked on top of each other, and brown mud covered the ground, Lah said. An iReporter with the username xeynon, who described himself as an American living and working in Sendai, said ""there are still many friends and acquaintances living along the coast we have not been able to contact."" Schumaker, her voice quivering, said those people should be the priority. ""People who lost their homes, or the people who are still needing help, they are the ones who need help,"" she said. ""We don't have any electric, water, gas, and the city just announced it could take 30 days to get gas set up for everybody. But we definitely need water and food, but please help the people who lost their homes and still ... on top of the buildings asking for help.""

1091,"(CNN) -- The swollen Red River that forms the border between Minnesota and North Dakota crested near 40 feet in Fargo, North Dakota, a spokesman for the City of Fargo Fire Department said Sunday. The river is expected to remain swollen for the next few days, said spokesman Jesse Schmidt. Rain forecast for Sunday had raised flooding fears along the Red River, where recreational boating was barred in several counties. But the worst of the predictions seems not to have materialized. The area could get up to half an inch of rain Sunday, Schmidt said. The region usually has seasonal flooding after warm weather and rain melts snow in early spring. Officials in Moorhead, Minnesota, across the border from Fargo, also were coping with the flooding, a repeat from 2010 and 2009. The Red River crested at nearly 41 feet in 2009. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, talked Saturday about improved levees and preparations. Still, she said, three people have died in Minnesota because of the flooding. ""This is a ferocious river,"" Klobuchar said. ""We have to continue to be careful."" Other Minnesota officials talked about the need for more flood mitigation. The U.S. Coast Guard said one of its crews rescued rescued five people along the Red River Saturday -- one resident and four responders. In Cass County, north of Fargo, residents placed sandbags along flooded streams and roads and used all-terrain vehicles to reach their homes.","Seasonal flooding has hit communities in upper Midwest .

1092,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Tokyo Electric Power Co., the company that owns the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, said Tuesday it is going to stick to its previously announced timetable of six to nine months in bringing an end to the crisis. But the company says it will have to change strategies in cooling the No. 1 reactor after it learned last week that water levels in the reactor were much lower than previously  believed. Tokyo Electric first laid out the six to nine month timetable for bringing an end to the crisis in mid-April. But the company said last week that the water levels in the No. 1 reactor were much lower than previously believed, and that it suspects the fuel rods had melted and fallen into the coolant at the base of the reactor pressure vessel. The company also said it suspects that the pressure vessel was leaking fluid into the surrounding concrete containment vessel. It was not clear where the leak was located or how bad it was, but the discovery could complicate efforts to restore normal cooling systems in the reactor. Three reactors at Fukushima Daiichi overheated after the plant was struck by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out the units' cooling systems and unleashed the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. Over the weekend, residents began evacuating from two villages which had originally been outside the danger zone drawn around the plant. The towns of Iitate and Kawamata were downwind of the plant in the early days of the disaster, and radiation levels there are high enough to raise the long-term risk of cancer for those remaining, the government said. ""I know that they are having to endure great hardships, and their life in evacuation going forward will be a very harsh one,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Monday. ""We truly regret that this had to happen."" Radiation levels in Iitate, about 40 km northwest of the plant, were nearly 40 times normal background levels Monday, according to data released by the country's Science Ministry. Someone who spent eight hours a day outside would get the government's maximum allowable dose of 20 millisieverts in about six months at those levels. Residents of those towns and all or part of three others were given orders to start packing in April. Five more areas have been put on notice to await evacuation orders, and the government says it will decide whether those residents will be allowed to return around the time the crisis is resolved. CNN's Kyung  Lah and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Tokyo Electric Power Co. first announced the timetable for ending the crisis in mid-April .

1093,"(CNN) -- This year's Fuji Rock Festival in Japan could be the most difficult for Masahiro Hidaka. He's the festival's organizer who over 15 years has faced down typhoons and musicians' monstrous egos to successfully host the annual three day music festival in the picturesque mountains of western Japan. But with the aftermath of the March earthquake and tsunami still unfolding in the northeast of the country, Hidaka is looking for ways to mark the gravity of the situation while allowing the thousands who visit each year to unwind and enjoy themselves. ""I think it will be a very emotional time for my staff and the audience,"" he says. ""We watched, like everyone else, the whole thing on TV. It is very hard to put into words my feeling as I have many friends in the disaster region and it's my country. Nobody deserves such horror."" ""Jishuku"" (self-restraint) has been added to the collective somber mood across the county and like many businesses in Japan, public events and festivals have suffered as a result. Hundreds of local cultural events and festivities have been cancelled or postponed indefinitely in the few months following the disaster. The Kabuto Metal Festival and Punkspring music festival were called off and it was reported that Japan's biggest classical music concert, La Folle Jouree au Japon, saw a large number of its musicians pull out. While some have been cancelled out of respect for the suffering of those in the disaster-hit area, some have been affected by the apprehension of some to visit Japan in troubled times; tourism to Japan has been hit hard, with a drop of 50% in visitor numbers in March 2011 compared with 12 months earlier. Johnny ""Fingers"" Moylett, Hidaka's co-producer of Fuji Rock, says that none of the bands has pulled out of their event scheduled for the end of July because of fears surrounding the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. However he admitted that ticket sales over the past couple of months had been much slower than in previous years. Hidaka says he had to reassure many international bands that it would be safe for them to play at the festival, yet many of them responded really positively to the crisis with some joining the ""Benefit for Nippon"" charity concert that took place in London last month. In many ways Hidaka believes the festival will be more vital than ever this year.

1094,"(CNN) -- The main airport in St. Louis is expected to operate a full flight schedule Tuesday, less than four days after a powerful tornado tore through the facility, airport officials said. But restoration efforts are far from over at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, where the Friday night storm shattered windows and ripped off part of a roof. ""It obviously just took a couple of minutes for the damage to occur,"" Airport Director Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""It will take weeks, maybe a couple of months, to clean up all of it."" Still, Hamm-Niebruegge said efforts to get the facility up and running again have been ""miraculous."" American Airlines returned to service on Monday, officials said. The last of the airport's 13 airlines -- Cape Air -- will resume flights on Tuesday, airport officials said. American and Cape Air were among the hardest hit after the storm, which devastated the airport's C concourse. The tornado damaged 750 homes near the airport, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said. And preliminary National Weather Service estimates released Saturday show the tornado packed winds between 111 and 165 miles per hour when it hit the airport. There were no fatalities reported -- a fact that Nixon characterized as ""absolutely amazing."" Tornado cripples St. Louis airport . At the airport, Hamm-Niebruegge said the facility's design -- and the way people responded to warnings -- played a key role. ""It is a historic building, and it's built very, very well. I think that had a part to do with it, but we also had very early warnings,"" she said. Besides damage to homes and the airport, the strong winds also hit businesses and tore through the roof of a Ferguson, Missouri, church where dozens had gathered on Good Friday to watch the movie ""The Passion of the Christ.""

1095,"(CNN) -- Federal officials are investigating a ""potential conflict"" between two planes at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, which happened shortly after Vice President Joe Biden's plane landed. ""It has nothing to do with Biden's plane,"" a Federal Aviation Administration official said. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board will look into the incident Monday morning between an ExpressJet plane taking off from one runway, while a SkyWest jet was preparing to land on an intersecting airstrip, an official told CNN Homeland Security correspondent Jeanne Meserve. The SkyWest aircraft, which was coming in behind the other jet, was ordered to circle around the airport after an air traffic controller recognized the potential conflict, the official said. It made an otherwise normal landing. The ExpressJet takeoff was not altered. The flights were being handled by different air traffic controllers, according to the official, who said there was ""no operational error"" -- a term used when flights get too close to each other. The official did not say how close the planes were. The incident took place shortly after Biden's plane landed at the airport for the inauguration of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.","The incident took place shortly after Vice President Joe Biden's plane landed .

1097,"Paris, France (CNN) -- The fiery crash that brought down a Concorde supersonic jet in 2000, killing 113 people, was caused partially by the criminal negligence of Continental Airlines and a mechanic who works for the company, a French court ruled Monday. Continental Airlines was fined 202,000 euros ($268,400) and ordered to pay 1 million euros to Air France, which operated the doomed flight. Mechanic John Taylor received a fine of 2,000 euros ($2,656) and a 15-month suspended prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter. The aircraft manufacturer EADS was also found partly responsible for the crash and ordered to pay 30% of damages to victims involved in the case. Air France has already paid an unspecified sum in damages to the families of most of the victims of the only crash ever of a Concorde. The mechanic was the only person found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel in the Paris suburb of Pontoise. He was not present for the verdict. His former supervisor, Stanley Ford, and three French officials were found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Henri Perrier, Jacques Herubel and Claude Frantzen were responsible for the design, testing and certification of the Concorde. The charges had said the engineers could have acted much earlier to correct well-known design flaws in the plane. Lawyers for Continental and Taylor rejected the guilty verdicts. ""I am shocked by this verdict, Taylor's lawyer Francois Esclatine said. ""I haven't had a chance to speak with my client yet, but I will tell him that he should appeal."" Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for Continental, said the airline ""will not let itself be pushed around in this way and we will definitely appeal."" The airline called the verdict ""absurd"" in a statement. Saying that the airline and Taylor were ""the sole guilty parties shows the determination of the French authorities to shift attention and blame away from Air France,"" which operated the flight and maintained the aircraft, Continental said. ""To find that any crime was committed in this tragic accident is not supported either by the evidence at trial or by aviation authorities and experts around the world,"" the statement said. Air France, which was a plaintiff in the Concorde trial, posted a statement on its website saying, the French national carrier ""welcomed the decision of the criminal court which recognizes Continental's full criminal and civil liability in the Concorde accident."" The Concorde burst into flames and smashed into a hotel on takeoff on July 25, 2000. Air France stopped flying the supersonic jets in 2003. A Continental Airlines plane that took off shortly before the doomed flight was found to have played a key role in the crash. A titanium strip allegedly fell off a Continental DC-10 which took off just before the Concorde. Judicial investigators say the strip was improperly installed on the DC-10 engine, prompting the charges against the airline, Ford and Taylor. A lawyer for the American airline had argued that Concorde's problems were apparent decades before the crash and that Continental was not to blame. An investigation revealed a tragic chain of events that brought down Air France Flight 4590 shortly after takeoff from Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport: a tire under the left wing blew on takeoff when it struck the small strip of titanium on the runway. The blown tire sent debris into the wing, causing the fuel tank to rupture and sparking the catastrophic fire that led to the crash that killed 100 passengers, nine crew and four people on the ground.

1098,"(CNN) -- Japan's national soccer team will not play as a guest nation at the Copa America tournament in Argentina after failing to secure the release of the earthquake-hit country's Europe-based players. The J-League has been so badly disrupted by the March 11 disaster that domestic clubs will not allow players to travel to South America. However, the Japanese Football Association was persuaded to revise its April 3 decision to pull out of the July 1-24 tournament, and had hoped to participate with a squad made up of its overseas stars. ""It is a great pity that we won't be able to take part in the tournament as the local people were preparing to welcome us,"" JFA president Junji Ogura told his association's website on Wednesday. ""We realized that we would not be able to form a squad good enough to play in the Copa America, and on that basis we had no choice but to give up the opportunity to play in the tournament."" JFA technical director Hiromi Hara met with officials at 11 clubs, but was told that they could not release the players because next season will start earlier than usual due to the mid-2012 staging of the European Championship in Poland and Ukraine. ""Many of our players have become top players at these clubs, and that is something to be pleased about,"" Hara said. ""Club officials told me they would understand if this was the Asian Cup or a one-off charity match, but they had a problem with it being the Copa America."" The JFA has made alternative plans to prepare for the 2014 World Cup qualifiers in September. The Samurai Blue will play Peru and the Czech Republic in the Kirin Cup in early June, and then take on South Korea in August in a friendly. Japan won the 2011 Asian Cup in Qatar in January, beating Australia in the final under the guidance of coach Alberto Zaccheroni. ""This year has turned to be an exceptional year following the East Japan disaster, and we have been put into a situation where we have had to make a difficult decision,"" the Italian said. ""However, we would like to move on to set our full focus on our preparations for our important World Cup qualifiers."" The Copa America tournament traditionally features two guest nations and 10 from South America. Costa Rica will replace Japan, while Mexico will be the other team from outside the CONMEBOL federation.","Costa Rica to replace Japan at the Copa America football tournament in July .

1099,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese regulators discounted concerns about damage to the still-potent spent fuel from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's No. 4 reactor Thursday, saying high radiation levels reported earlier this week ""most probably"" came from outside debris. A high reading above the pool prompted the plant's owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, to take a sample from the spent fuel pool on Tuesday. But the radiation levels are far lower than they would be if there were damage to the fuel rods, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, the chief spokesman for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Commission. ""We need more analysis to identify the precise status of the spent fuel in unit 4,"" he said. Tokyo Electric said Thursday night that the sample was the first time they have taken a reading off one of the spent fuel pools. The water temperature in the No. 4 pool was 90 degrees Celsius, more than twice a normal reading, and more coolant water was poured into the reservoir on Wednesday. The company said it suspects the fuel rods were damaged due to insufficient coolant at some point since the crisis began, but could not clarify the timing. Nishiyama told reporters Thursday evening that the fuel rods have not suffered ""any particular damage."" Officials are still looking at the readings from that water sample before reaching a final conclusion, but said the radiation reading was ""most probably due to debris"" blown into the badly damaged housing around the No. 4 reactor. The Tokyo Electric Power Company reported a cumulative radiation reading above the pool at 84 millisieverts on Tuesday, about a third of the annual allowable dose for plant workers during the emergency. Water samples from the pool showed a concentration of radioactive iodine-131, the most commonly measured reactor byproduct, at 220,000 bequerels per liter -- more than 730 times the amount considered safe for drinking water in Japan. Outside observers have expressed concerns about the status of the spent fuel in reactors 1, 3 and 4 several times during the month-long crisis at Fukushima Daiichi, about 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Temperature sensors in those pools have been out since mid-March, and workers have been spraying water into the damaged housings of those reactors on a near-daily basis to keep them topped off. The battle began March 11, when the tsunami that followed Japan's magnitude 9 earthquake knocked out the plant's cooling systems. Tokyo Electric estimated the height of that wall of water at 14 to 15 m (45 to 48 feet) -- a level Nishiyama said would be the new standard for barriers around Japanese nuclear power plants. The sea wall around Fukushima Daiichi was 5 m. In the aftermath of the tsunami, the cores of three of Fukushima Daiichi's six reactors were damaged by overheating and resulting hydrogen explosions blew apart the buildings surrounding reactors 1 and 3. The vast amount of radiation released from the plant, largely in the first two weeks of the disaster, prompted Japanese authorities to rate the crisis at the top of the international scale that measures nuclear accidents. The Level 7 designation puts Fukushima Daiichi on par with the April 1986 Chernobyl accident in the former Soviet Union, though Japanese authorities say their plant has spewed only 10 percent of the radioactivity that was emitted from Chernobyl. Plant workers have been pouring hundreds of tons of water a day into the three reactors that were damaged in the aftermath, and at least one of the reactors, in unit 2, is believed to be leaking highly radioactive water. Radioactive contamination spread across a wide swath of land around the plant and into the adjacent Pacific Ocean, though data released by government ministries has shown a decline in radiation levels in recent weeks. Engineers have taken steps this week toward containing the disaster, pumping radioactive water from service trenches and tunnels into a storage reservoir for No. 2 reactor's steam condensers. And they are laying the piping needed to transfer an estimated 10,000 tons into a facility designed for treating low-level radioactive waste Tokyo Electric said Thursday. The company dumped more than 9,000 tons of less-radioactive water into the Pacific last week to make room for the more-dangerous fluid believed to be leaking from reactor No. 2 -- a move Japanese authorities described as an emergency measure, but one that enraged the country's fishermen. The government issued expanded evacuation orders Monday for several towns outside the 30-kilometer radius that was declared a danger zone in the early days of the disaster, warning that prolonged exposure to radiation levels there could pose a long-term danger to human health. And Japanese government data this week reported finding low levels of radioactive strontium, another reactor byproduct, in two of those towns in the days after the disaster. Strontium-90 is considered a health hazard not only because of its 29-year radioactive half-life but because a portion of it gets absorbed by bone if ingested, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. There is no acceptable standard for strontium under Japanese regulations, but Japan's science ministry said the reported figures were not high enough to pose an immediate danger to human health. The Japanese government has tried to limit the damage done to farmers in Fukushima and other prefectures where contamination from the plant has been found, lifting bans on farm products from surrounding areas if they pass three tests in three successive weeks. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano, the government's point man on the crisis, announced Thursday that kakina, a leafy green, from Tochigi Prefecture was now safe for shipment. The move follows a ban on outdoor-grown shiitake mushrooms from 16 towns and villages neighboring damaged plant to the country's banned food list Wednesday.

1100,"Joplin, Missouri (CNN) -- Authorities in Missouri will release Friday an updated list of people who are still missing after the tornado that devastated the region. This list will be an update of the tally of 232 missing people the Missouri Department of Public Safety released Thursday. As officials worked to ensure the community was up-to-date, some residents got answers on the fate of loved ones following  the massive tornado that hit the Missouri city of Joplin on Sunday. Michelle Hare said she learned that her 16-year-old son had been confirmed dead. Lantz was ripped from a car Sunday night by winds exceeding 200 mph, and was one of the people named Thursday. Authorities also said 126 people had died from the storm, making the tornado the single deadliest  to touch down in the U.S. since modern record-keeping began  in 1950. The Hares had been among many around Joplin, still desperately searching for missing loved ones. But one of the frustrations was  a holdup  at the morgue. Some were told that they may have to wait for two weeks  before they can visit the morgue to search for relatives. A local coroner said that this will change for some Friday as some people will be allowed into the morgue to identify family members if they know unique characteristics such as tattoos. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said the sheer magnitude of the storm has made the process of identifying victims difficult and will mean that some of the bodies will have to be identified by DNA. ""This is not a series of bodies lying in a row that are easily identifiable. There are pieces of folks,"" Nixon told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""There are very, very difficult scenes. It's not as easy as walking down a row and being able to instantly identify."" And many of the people who survived the powerful storm had stories to tell. Aaron Cox said after the storm, he frantically tried to find his sister. Unlike many others in Joplin, Cox  said he found his sister while frantically searching through leveled streets that were barely recognizable. ""I've lived in Joplin my entire life. But everything was so leveled. You had no idea where you were... With the street signs gone. There was no houses, no trees, no nothing,"" said Cox, who documented his search for his sister on video. ""It was just completely barren."" CNN's Chuck Johnston, Joe Sutton, Marlena Baldacci, Phil Gast, Mike Pearson, Jessica Jordan, Sean Morris and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","At least 126 people are confirmed dead, coroner says .

1101,"(CNN) -- Torrential rain and massive floods that have been pounding Colombia this year have not let up, and dozens of people are dead amid widespread destruction, the Colombian Red Cross said Wednesday. Eighty-six people have died so far this year, it said, mainly in the central region that includes the provinces of Cundinamarca, Caldas and Antioquia. Fifty have been injured and 21 are still missing. In addition, 378,000 people have been evacuated in the South American country because their homes were destroyed by the floods, the Red Cross said. Affected areas include 1,001 municipalities in 28 of the 32 Colombian provinces. The Federal District, in which Bogota, the capital, is located, also has been affected. Sandra Calvo, a spokeswoman with the Colombian Red Cross, called the situation ""very complicated"" and a ""total emergency."" ""This is the longest rainy season we've had in the last 40 years and the one that has caused the most destruction,"" Calvo said. ""We've had everything from mudslides and flooding to rivers overflowing and destroying everything in their path."" After touring one of the most affected areas, the municipality of Puerto Nare in Antioquia province, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said more rain is expected, which will further complicate the situation. ""This tragedy has no precedent in our history. These mountains behind me are literally crumbling and that's going to cause many problems,"" he said. Santos also called on Colombians to ""work together,"" and ""coordinate our efforts"" to reduce the ""immense costs resulting from this tragedy."" Andres Gonzalez Diaz, governor of Cundinamarca province, said this is ""the worst catastrophe"" his government has faced. ""We have hundreds of destroyed houses and important crops that were swept away by the floods, but fortunately we've been able to minimize the loss of human lives,"" he said. Gonzalez also said that at least 20 people have died in Cundinamarca. A dozen people died in accidents resulting from roads and bridges left structurally unstable by floods and heavy rain. Antioquia is the province with the highest number of fatalities. The death toll there stands at 131, according to the Colombian Red Cross. This is the second consecutive year that Colombia has been devastated by torrential rain and massive flooding.

1102,"(CNN) -- One woman was killed and another injured after they fell from a 10th-floor window at an Atlanta hotel, authorities said Saturday. According to Atlanta Police, witnesses said the two were attending a birthday party early Saturday at the W Atlanta-Midtown. The pair were ""play fighting"" when they accidentally crashed through the window around 3:15 a.m., according to a preliminary investigation, said department spokesman Officer John Chafee. It was unclear Saturday where they landed. The Fulton County medical examiner identified the woman who died at the scene as LaShawna M. Threatt of Atlanta. The cause of death is pending. The other woman, who was unidentified, was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital in critical condition. Hotel manager Michael O'Donohue said information on the investigation must come from authorities.

1104,"(CNN) -- For the wife of at least one survivor of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, April 20, 2010 is the day she lost her husband. Meccah Boynton-Brown says although her husband Doug made it off the ill-fated rig, he will never be the same. ""There were more than 11 lives lost that day. Yes, there are 11 people that will never come home and see their families again, and my heart is so sad for them,"" Boynton-Brown said. But she added, ""I am married to a different person now. I will always stand by his side but it seems like his previous spirit and character will never return."" First 100 days of oil disaster . According to medical records provided to CNN, Doug Brown has been diagnosed with a litany of mental issues from the injuries he sustained and the horrors he saw onboard the Deepwater Horizon including post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and depression and anxiety. His wife Meccah says his near-constant cycle of anxiety, frustration, anger and depression has had a profoundly detrimental effect on them and their 11 year-old daughter Kirah. ""My life has come to a stop. My daughter's life has pretty much come to a stop . . . the first thing I think Doug wants is to sleep a whole night without having a nightmare,"" she said. Doug Brown worries about the welfare of his wife and daughter too. ""My family is suffering from it. My daughter even has asked Mommy, my wife, 'What's wrong with Daddy? He's not acting like he used to,'"" he said, adding, ""I just want to go sit in the corner and just cut off the world . . . so I don't hear or think about anything that has to do with that night."" Another survivor's wife, Amanda Barron, admits she feels guilt from knowing her husband Dan could've suffered a much worse fate while, at the same time, still lamenting that he's not the man she married. Commission spreads blame in Gulf oil disaster report . ""I love him and there's little glimpses of the old Dan, like his sense of humor, but it's his temperament and everything is totally different than what he was,"" she said. She added, ""I feel so guilty saying . . .'I don't have the same man' you know when they, the eleven [families] don't have their husbands, brothers, uncles anymore."" Dan Barron too has been diagnosed with PTSD and depression, according to medical records provided to CNN. He witnessed one of his good friends, who he calls a ""fallen brother,"" die right in front of him when a second explosion rocked the Deepwater Horizon rig. ""It literally picked him up . . . like a child would throw a toy . . . and he ended up bouncing off of the pedestal for the crane,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper last year shortly after the disaster. ""Just to see him get blown up like that, I mean, it was, it's heart wrenching,"" Barron also told Cooper. Barron says one night the psychological pain, and the guilt of surviving when so many friends did not, became overwhelming. Witness to explosion saw a ""bunch of smoke"" ""I had a 6-shot pistol, and I just wanted it to be over,"" he said. His wife was in bed, heard a clicking sound and jumped up in horror. ""I had a hard time getting it [the gun] from him,"" she said. ""It was like he was playing Russian roulette to see how many times it would take to click it until the bullet went,"" she said, adding, ""I still have nightmares."" Both survivors are suing Transocean for pain and suffering and loss of wages. While technically still employees of the company, they have not worked on a rig since the disaster and stopped getting paid by Transocean last December but do still get some health costs covered. Transocean does not specifically dispute their claims of injuries and a company spokesman told CNN in a statement, ""From the first hours Transocean has focused on providing support for its employees and the families of those who were lost aboard the Deepwater Horizon, including continued full pay and benefits for eight months following the incident and professional counseling for those in need."" Transocean suing Gulf oil spill widow . Both families worry how their children are being affected by the fallout from the disaster. The Barrons 11-year-old daughter Faith is autistic and so far seems unaware of changes in her father, but their 15 year-old son Austin has gone from being an exemplary student to getting C's and D's. Amanda Barron says the worst moment for Austin came when he found out his father attempted suicide. ""He had the hardest time with it because he loves his Dad so much,"" she said. For Doug Brown and Dan Barron, Wednesday's anniversary marks a year since their lives irrevocably changed and for their wives, a year since they lost the husbands they fell in love with. ""I don't know how she stays with me, you know? I really don't,"" Dan Barron said of his wife Meccah, adding, ""She's a saint."" Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

1105,"(CNN) -- The list of people missing in tornado-ravaged Joplin, Missouri, shrunk to eight on Wednesday, as officials told CNN that the bodies of two people previously on the list had been identified. Stanley Kirk and Maria Alvares Torres died in the storm, and their next-of-kin were notified, said Seth Bundy with the Department of Public Safety. News reports suggested that two other people listed as ""unaccounted for"" may have been declared dead as well.  Bundy said declarations are not made official until family members are informed. Authorities also announced that a woman who was not listed as missing has died as a result of the severe weather that struck May 22, Bundy said. Over the weekend, Joplin City Manager Mark Rohr told CNN the death toll stood at 142.  Not all the names had been released.  It was not immediately clear whether the deaths announced Wednesday were included in the toll. The May 22 tornado flattened buildings, destroyed neighborhoods and killed more people than any other U.S. tornado since modern record-keeping began in 1950. ""It's indescribable ... just devastating to see all the destruction of my school, my home,"" said Joplin High School sophomore Chanci McGowen, CNN affiliate KODE reported. ""My whole neighborhood is gone, but everyone's OK."" The station broadcast images of a memorial service at the school, where a sign out front just had the letters ""op"" from ""Joplin.""

1106,"(CNN) -- Louisiana's swollen Atchafalaya River was slowly receding along its entire length Tuesday after federal authorities flooded it to save the Mississippi River cities of New Orleans and Baton Rouge, the National Weather Service reported. The Atchafalaya crested at more than six feet above flood stage at Morgan City, about 80 miles west of New Orleans, and forecasters are projecting a long, steady decline, said Shawn O'Neil, a meteorologist at the Weather Service office in Slidell. The river's peak at Morgan City was 10.35 feet -- barely two inches below its historic high-water mark in 1973 -- ""and now it's slowly, slowly falling,"" O'Neil said. Leroy Breaux, a resident of nearby Amelia, said the water rose about halfway up Morgan City's sea wall, where the name of the town is etched into the concrete. ""The water is up over the wall, and it's like the word Morgan City is sitting in the water,"" he said. Some businesses along the waterfront outside the sea wall flooded, but the sea wall -- and a massive barge sunk into nearby Bayou Chene -- prevented high water from reaching neighborhoods in and around the area, Breaux said. ""The blessing is there's no rain. If you had the amount of rain you had in 1973, you would have a much worse problem,"" said Breaux, who lived in Amelia during that year's flood and now serves as chairman of a local flood-control district. The Army Corps of Engineers began diverting water from the Mississippi into the Atchafalaya basin on May 14 by opening the Morganza Spillway above Baton Rouge. The agency began closing the spillway last Wednesday, shutting seven of the 17 bays opened during the operation by Tuesday evening, Corps spokeswoman Rachel Rodi said. At the peak of the diversion, as much as 1.2 million gallons of water per second were pouring into the Atchafalaya basin from the Mississippi, the Corps reported. The Atchafalaya may not reach its normal levels until ""well into June,"" O'Neil said. Officials said last week that flooding in the basin was not as severe as expected after the spillway's opening. But at least 1,230 structures in 13 parishes were affected by rising water, according to the state Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness office.","NEW: ""The blessing is there's no rain,"" one area resident says .

1108,"Madrid (CNN) -- The European Commission on Wednesday rescinded its health warning against cucumbers from Spain, according to a statement from the Spanish Health Ministry. Spanish officials have been denying accusations that their country was the cause of a deadly E. coli outbreak that has swept across Germany and Sweden. The health warning was lifted after Spanish authorities shared negative test results on the produce in question with the commission, the statement noted. Last week, German officials implied Spanish cucumbers were the cause of an illness that has sickened more than 1,000 people. The outbreak is responsible for 15 deaths in Germany and one in Sweden, according to media reports citing local authorities. CNN has confirmed at least 12 deaths including the one in Sweden, a woman who had recently visited Germany. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Spain will not rule out ""taking action against the authorities (in Germany) who questioned the quality of our products."" He was speaking in an SER radio interview. The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal unit responsible for disease control and prevention, has reported 1,064 cases of E. coli infection, and 470 cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious complication that can result from E. coli. Rubalcaba later responded forcefully to the accusation that the outbreak originated with produce from Spain after chairing a meeting of government officials and fresh produce exporters Wednesday in the southern city of Almeria. ""What we ask of Germany is get to the bottom of this,"" Rubalcaba told a nationally televised news conference after the meeting. ""The country most interested in knowing the truth is Spain. It's not our products. All of the people who are affected are in Hamburg or were in Hamburg, so it seems the problem is there."" ""The proof is that there are no cases in Spain. If the bacteria came from Spain, we would see infections. Our products are absolutely clean, our cucumbers in this case. It's not a problem of the origin of the products,"" Rubalcaba said. ""If it was from the cucumbers, there would be cases (of illness) in Spain,"" Rubalcaba said, adding that there haven't been. ""The Hamburg (Germany) authorities don't know where it comes from. I understand they have a problem. We have said, 'You need to say it wasn't us.' "" While authorities in Germany worked to contain and respond to the outbreak, the specific cause remained unclear. The European Food Safety Alert Network said EHEC, or enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, a strain of E. coli that causes hemorrhaging in the intestines, was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain. But the source has not yet been pinpointed, authorities said. Spanish officials and export producers have talked publicly of demanding compensation from Germany or the European Union. The produce export sector says it stands to lose $290 million a week, as consumer fears over cucumbers have spread to most European countries, largely stopping imports of Spanish produce, including tomatoes, lettuce and other vegetables. Rubalcaba told the news conference there'll be time to talk about demands for proper compensation but added, ""It's evident they have endangered the jobs of many people without proof. We know (the infection) is a serious problem, but the Spanish products have nothing to do with that crisis."" Health officials in Hamburg, where many remain hospitalized from the infection, said Thursday that Spanish cucumbers appeared to carry the E. coli. But on Tuesday, they said two of the three Spanish cucumbers tested showed they did not carry the E. coli strain that has caused the health problems, while a third Spanish cucumber and another cucumber of unknown origin were still being tested. Spanish media reported that as a significant backtracking by Germany. The export producers federation Fepex issued a statement Wednesday saying the ""priority now is to return to normal in the European markets for fruits and vegetables and re-establish confidence in Spanish products after Germany corrected itself on Tuesday and removed Spanish cucumbers as the origin of the lethal strain of E. coli."" Germany is the top purchaser of Spain's produce, according to Fepex. In 2010, Spain exported 9.4 million tons of produce; a quarter of that went to Germany, Fepex said. Fresh produce exports had $11 billion in revenue overall in 2010.

1109,"(CNN) -- A 73-year-old man shot dead five people around Yuma, Arizona, before turning a gun on himself, police said. Another victim was flown about 180 miles northeast to a Phoenix-area hospital after being seriously injured, Yuma Police Sgt. Clint Norred said in a joint press release with the Yuma County Sheriff's Office. According to Yuma police, an ""elderly male"" went into a business in the city limits and shot an adult male. Police Chief Jerry Geier later identified this victim as Jerrold Shelley, a local attorney. The four others were killed in greater Yuma County, where the other person was injured, according to Yuma Police Officer Cruz Vidal. Police determined that these shootings were linked and identified the suspect as Carey Hal Dyess, a 73-year-old Yuma man. Around 11:30 a.m., Yuma County sheriff's deputies found Dyess dead off U.S. Highway 95 in Blaisdell, a community east of Yuma. He died from ""what appears to be ... a self-inflicted gunshot wound,"" police said. Yuma is a city of more than 87,000 people, according to a 2006 U.S. Census Bureau estimate, out of nearly 200,000 people in the county. It is near the intersection of Arizona, California and Mexico, about 170 miles east of San Diego.

1110,"Tokyo (CNN) -- As searches for nearly 13,000 missing continued Sunday, police in Japan said 8,199 people had died since the monster earthquake and ensuing tsunami struck last week. Meanwhile, the March 11 tremors shifted the Oshika Peninsula near the epicenter by just over 17 feet and dropped it by just over 4 feet, the Geospatial Information Authority in Tsukuba, Japan, reported Saturday. Those two land mass movements are records for Japan, according to government figures. The global positioning system data from the Tsukuba University-based authority revealed the peninsula on the Pacific coast moved in an east-southeasterly direction toward the epicenter. The quake also moved land masses in many areas ranging from the northeastern region of Tohoku to the Kanto region including Tokyo, the authority said. Search and rescue efforts have been hampered by snowfall in the hardest-hit areas, said spokesman Patrick Fuller of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""The cold is a real issue, particularly for the thousands of people in shelters, many of them elderly,"" he said, describing providing medical care as a ""massive challenge."" While efforts accelerated Saturday to restore power to cooling systems at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the focus shifted toward rebuilding in some parts of the country hardest hit by the temblor and the devastating wall of water that followed. ""We need to go forward,"" Rikuzentakata Mayor Futoshi Toba told construction workers, according to Kyodo News. Crews began building hundreds of temporary, prefabricated housing units in the coastal city, the agency said. A widely reported rescue Saturday offered a brief glimmer of hope amid headlines of death and destruction. But Japanese authorities later changed their story, saying a man rescued from the rubble of his home Saturday had actually been staying in a shelter. Originally, the Japanese Self-Defense Force reported that the man had been trapped for eight days. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Electric Power Co. said workers had laid extensive electrical cable near the Fukushima Daiichi power plant's No. 2 nuclear reactor -- a key step in an effort to restore power to the plant that authorities hope will keep temperatures low. That would curb the emission of radioactive material and, in a worst-case scenario, a full nuclear meltdown. Tokyo's fire department also began a new method of spraying water in and around the Fukushima Daiichi power plant's No. 3 reactor using an unmanned system that can spray sea water for up to seven hours at a time. In previous missions, firefighters, soldiers and power company workers had manually done the same in brief intervals to avoid prolonged radiation exposure. Tests revealed abnormally high levels of radiation that violate Japanese food safety laws in samples of spinach and milk from areas near the nuclear plant, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Saturday. Authorities are mulling regulating movement of agricultural products from the area, as well as collecting more data for analysis, Edano said. On Friday, authorities acknowledged that the situation at the troubled power plant was far more serious than they had originally estimated. Tokyo Electric's managing director, Akio Komiri, broke down in tears after leaving a news conference in Fukushima at which exposure levels were discussed. In a written statement, company president Masataka Shimizu said, ""we sincerely apologize ... for causing such a great concern and nuisance."" Even as the country's emergency agency raised its rating of the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant from a 4 to 5 -- putting it on par with the 1979 incident at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island -- Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan told his compatriots to bury their pessimism Friday. ""With a tsunami and earthquake we don't have any room to be pessimistic,"" he said. ""We are going to create Japan again from scratch. We should face this challenge together."" Kan acknowledged the situation at the Fukushima plant remains ""very grave"" and said his government has disclosed all that it knows to both the Japanese people and the international community. ""The police, fire department and self defense forces are all working together, putting their lives on the line, in an attempt to resolve the situation,"" he said. Meanwhile, the government raised the radiation exposure level for workers trying to avert a further crisis, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported Saturday. Tokyo Electric said workers at the plant -- including company employees, members of the military and firefighters -- can now be exposed to 250 millisieverts of radiation before they must leave the area. An individual in a developed country is naturally exposed to about 3 millisieverts of radiation a year. The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends no more than 50 millisieverts exposure in a given year for nuclear rescue and recovery workers. It offers no restriction in a crisis when ""the benefit to others clearly outweighs the rescuer's risk."" Tokyo Electric has said it was doing all it can to protect workers' health. Japan's nuclear agency said Friday several hundred workers, including nonpower company employees, remained on site. In populated areas outside the nuclear facility, there have been few indications of any immediate, dangerous fall-out from the crisis so far. For the past eight days, weather patterns indicate that the wind has likely blown most emitted radiation out to sea. The British Embassy will run its last bus from Sendai to Tokyo on Sunday. As of Saturday, five of the embassy's free buses had transported 61 British nationals, 15 dependents and 31 persons of other nationalities over that route, according to Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. ""Based on demand, we do not plan to run any more coaches after Sunday,"" the office said in a statement. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report .","NEW: Death toll rises to 8,199 people .

1112,"(CNN) -- At least 10 people being smuggled by boat died in the Gulf of Aden ""after a two-day journey from Somalia to Yemen,"" the United Nations' refugee agency said Tuesday. ""Ten Ethiopians suffocated en route to Yemen as the smugglers crammed and confined 25 people to the engine room with no ventilation,"" the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. ""Survivors claim that their bodies were thrown into the sea some seven hours after departure."" There were reports that another four people reportedly died in waves, the agency said. This reportedly happened as ""smugglers, fearing detection by the Yemeni navy, forced the remaining passengers to disembark too far from the coast. After the exhausting trip they were simply too tired to swim and succumbed to the rough sea."" The Horn of Africa has been wracked by warfare, famine and political instability, conditions that have spurred flight. More than 9,000 Somalis and 27,000 Ethiopians have arrived in Yemen by boat so far this year. Some of the passengers found on Yemen's shore near Al Hamra said the smuggler's boat left Bosaso in the Puntland region of northern Somalia on Sunday. There were 101 survivors. ""We condemn the unscrupulous and inhumane treatment of refugees and others who are desperately seeking to flee the violence, human rights abuses and seriously debilitating life options in the Horn of Africa,"" said Erika Feller, UNHCR's assistant high commissioner for protection. ""We have witnessed similar, isolated, individual incidents before utter disregard for human life.""

1114,"Beijing (CNN) -- She ate her favorite food all day long and rarely exercised. She had a few brief failed relationships but mostly stayed single and never gave birth. Defying conventional wisdom on a healthy lifestyle, she somehow found the secret to longevity. When she died of kidney failure on May 7 in southern China, some local media called Ming Ming, 34, the world's oldest giant panda, generating global headlines. Wild pandas live 15 years on average, while those in captivity can live much longer thanks to improved nutrition and medical care, according to WWF, the nature conservation organization whose logo famously features a giant panda. CNN anchor's surprising views on pandas . At least two pandas had lived longer than Ming Ming, state media has reported. Tao Tao died in 2008 at the age of 36 and Chang Chang passed away in 2002 at the age of 35. ""The longevity of those pandas doesn't have too much to do with our conservation effort,"" said Professor Fan Zhiyong, head of the species program at WWF's Beijing office. ""In captivity pandas don't have to worry about food sources, infectious diseases and competition from other species -- all of which remain challenges to their survival in the wild."" While both Tao Tao and Chang Chang spent most of their lives in a zoo in eastern China, Ming Ming's life journey spanned half the globe. Her longevity had surpassed most people's expectations. She was rescued in 1979 in the mountains of Sichuan province, a rare sanctuary for one of the world's most endangered species. Some 300 pandas live in captivity in China, mostly in breeding programs aimed at boosting the low population caused by disappearing natural habitats and low fertility rate. Fewer than a dozen zoos outside China have pandas. ""Ming Ming had always been weak ever since she was rescued,"" said Huang Zhi, one of her caretakers at China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, also in Sichuan, where she grew up. ""She was quite timid and not very close to people,"" he added. Despite the personality, Ming Ming played the panda ambassador when the Chinese government dispatched her to the London Zoo in 1991. Fighting instead of mating with a male panda from Berlin, Ming Ming failed her most important duty and returned home three years later. She moved one last time in 1998 to a safari park in the southern Guangdong province, where old age eventually caused multiple health problems. Huang, Ming Ming's longtime caretaker, last visited her in April. ""Her eyesight was deteriorating -- and she moved very slowly and ate very little,"" he recalled. ""I felt she was very old.""","Ming Ming dies on May 7 in southern China .

1115,"(CNN) -- Emergency crews freed an injured caver Monday who fell during a difficult expedition through a remote Franklin County, Tennessee, cave, a county spokesman said. The nature of the man's injuries was unclear, according to county spokesman Chris Guess, who said the victim would be transferred to Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga for treatment. The man fell Sunday afternoon on the seventh of eight vertical descents, or drops, inside the Sinking Cove Cave in southern Tennessee, not far from the Tennessee-Alabama border, according to Brian Krebs with the Southeastern Cave Conservancy. The group holds the lease on the cave. The expedition being attempted by the man, who is an experienced caver according to Krebs, would rate about a 9.5 on a difficulty scale of 10, he said. Before the rescue, Krebs said extracting the injured man from the cave would be a challenge. Not only did he have to be lifted through the seven drops, but the man had to pass through a small crawl space that is about eight inches high and 14 inches wide, Krebs said. Rescue workers made that crawl space bigger so they could get him out, according to Guess. The rescue was complicated by the lack of cell service and the remote location. Krebs said the site is ""about as far back in the wilderness as you can go."" CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","NEW: A man injured during a Tennessee cave expedition is freed .

1116,"(CNN) -- Heavy winds from a severe storm caused significant damage, shattered windows and sent debris raining down on passengers at an airport in St. Louis Friday night. The Lambert-St. Louis International Airport is closed indefinitely while officials investigate the damage, St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay told reporters. ""There was a reported sighting of a tornado. Although that has not been confirmed, that storm caused significant damage to the airport,"" he said. The reported tornado twisted metal and blew out plate-glass windows in the airport's main terminal, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. Four people were transported to nearby hospitals with injuries, Slay said. Passengers were hit with flying glass and debris as winds ripped off part of the roof in the airport's C concourse, the station reported. One witness described a chaotic scene outside the terminal as officials evacuated passengers from at least one aircraft. ""The plane was rocking back and forth,"" said Brett Knewitz of Albuquerque, New Mexico, who was on a plane that was about to take off from the airport when the storm hit. Initially officials did not allow evacuated passengers into the airport, he said, because of concerns that the building's roof would collapse.Once he was allowed inside, Knewitz said he saw an injured gate agent. ""She was bleeding like crazy,"" he said. Concourse C is used by American Airlines, AirTran and Cape Air, airport spokesman Jeff Lea said. The National Weather Service said witnesses believe a tornado was on the ground for several miles and observed the twister from a tower at the airport. KSDK reported that the storm also blew the steeple off a church and forced authorities to close highways.

1117,"Baghdad (CNN) -- Four people were killed and two were wounded when a so-called sticky bomb attached to a vehicle exploded Wednesday evening in the Ashhabi neighborhood of eastern Falluja, local police told CNN. The fatalities -- three Interior Ministry officials and a child -- included the director of the Falluja police intelligence department, the deputy police chief of the Garma police station, the police commissioner and a 7-year-old boy, police said. The wounded included a 5-year-old boy and a police official, police said. The children -- brothers -- were playing when the vehicle drove by carrying the four police officials, who had attended a funeral in eastern Falluja and were returning home when it detonated, police said. Iraqi security forces in Falluja were investigating the incident. The report of the blast came after bombings in three Iraqi cities over the previous day killed five people and wounded several others, police told CNN. In one, a colonel was driving from his home in Kirkuk to the town of Dibia, where he served as police commander. Dibia is about 12 miles north of Kirkuk, which is in the country's north. There has been longstanding sectarian tension among Kurdish, Arab and Turkmen people in Kirkuk. The colonel was Kurdish, but there was no immediate information on whether the bombing was tied to ethnic hostilities. Over a two-hour period in and around the capital, Baghdad, on Wednesday, three attacks wounded several people, police said. Attackers shot and critically wounded a police colonel while he was driving near Shaab stadium in the east. Five people were wounded in a roadside bombing north of the city in Taji. And a police commissioner was wounded when a sticky bomb attached to his car exploded. On Tuesday night, three people were killed in Baghdad when a car bomb exploded on a commercial street in the southwestern Saydiya neighborhood. City police said 15 others were wounded. In Ramadi, more than 60 miles west of Baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded near an Iraqi police patrol, and one police officer died.  Ramadi is in the predominantly Sunni Arab Anbar province, an area engulfed by violence during the height of the Iraq war. This came after a bloody Sunday, when 17 bombs exploded across Baghdad, killing at least 19 people and wounding more than 80, Iraqi authorities said. The attacks were the latest in a spate in recent weeks that have raised concerns about Iraq's ability to protect itself. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said he plans to meet this month with Iraqi political leaders to discuss whether to ask that U.S. troops remain in Iraq beyond the January 1, 2012, withdrawal deadline. The United Nations office in Iraq has expressed concern about recent violence targeting government and security officials. Al-Maliki has said al Qaeda and other terrorists are behind the killings, but he also has blamed political movements and security guards, and he has promised to pursue the attackers.","NEW: The casualties include a 7-year-old boy .

1118,"Kennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) -- The final launch of the space shuttle Endeavour was delayed Friday, temporarily putting off what promised to be an emotional moment for the mission's commander. Liftoff -- originally scheduled for 3:47 p.m. ET -- was delayed by at least 72 hours due to concerns with the shuttle's heating system. As part of NASA's examination of the problem, the shuttle's external fuel tank will be drained of its oxygen and hydrogen propellants. ""The engineering team did not understand how this problem occurred and did not feel comfortable proceeding with a launch attempt,"" NASA spokesman George Diller said. Cmdr. Mark Kelly's wife, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, traveled to Florida to watch the shuttle's ascent. President Obama and the first lady also went to the launch site, and Obama personally visited with Giffords for about 10 minutes, a White House official said. President meets with Giffords . Obama also met the entire Endeavour crew, including Kelly. ""I bet you were hoping to see a rocket launch today,"" Kelly told the president. ""We were hoping to see you,"" Obama told him. Kelly updated Obama and the first lady on Giffords' condition, and then they went down the corridor to see her, the administration official said. Three months ago, Giffords was nearly killed when a would-be assassin shot her in the head during a meeting with constituents in Tucson, Arizona. It was not immediately clear if Giffords' doctors -- who are overseeing her lengthy rehabilitation -- will allow her to remain in Florida for the duration of the delay. Giffords' office said Friday that her travel plans are ""undetermined,"" according to a statement. ""Congresswoman Giffords is disappointed that Endeavour was unable to launch today, but realizes that mission safety must come first. Launch delays are not uncommon with the space shuttle,"" the statement said. ""We are looking forward to the quick rescheduling of this scientifically important mission. The congresswoman was pleased, however, to have been able to meet with President Obama and the first family."" Space shuttle: What have we learned? Kelly was tapped to lead a crew that includes pilot Gregory Johnson; mission specialists Michael Fincke, Greg Chamitoff and Andrew Feustel; and European Space Agency astronaut Roberto Vittori. Endeavour has logged more than 103 million miles in space, blasting off 24 times, but its 25th flight will be its last. As NASA's shuttle program winds down with the last launch scheduled this summer, many in the astronaut corps are wrestling with what to do next. For the foreseeable future, Russian rockets will be the only way for U.S. astronauts to get to space. Fincke spent a total of a year in space on the International Space Station, getting there and back twice on Russian rockets. But Friday's delayed flight will be his first on the shuttle. ""I think all of us, with all the changes that are going on, with our country's space program and NASA, all of us professional astronauts are looking into our hearts to see what we're going to do next,"" Fincke said. Four spacewalks are planned for the mission. The space walkers will retrieve experiments, install new ones, refill tanks and lubricate parts at the International Space Station. In its cargo bay, Endeavour will carry the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. At $1.5 billion, it is the most expensive piece of equipment a space shuttle has ever carried. The spectrometer is designed to capture space particles like anti-matter and dark matter that scientists know very little about but believe exist in the universe. The spectrometer will be mounted outside the International Space Station. If it's successful, it could lead to a better understanding of how our universe began and evolved. A few months ago, before his wife was shot, Kelly talked about his upcoming mission. ""Flying in space is a very difficult thing to give up,"" Kelly said. ""I remember after my last flight thinking 'Well, maybe this is the last time I'm gonna do this.' And, you know, you go a couple of months out and you're like, 'Oh, I really hope this is not the end of my flying career.'"" Kelly said that when STS 134, the Endeavour's last flight, is over, ""I'll be thinking the same thing, I can't really give this up. I've got to figure out a way to get back into space."" CNN's John Zarrella, Eric Fiegel, Danielle Dellorto and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Giffords expresses disappointment at delay in launch .

1120,"Atlanta (CNN) -- One of the world's largest concrete pumps is being readied to get on a massive cargo plane and head to Japan, all part of the effort to address the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The 190,000-pound truck pump was moved off a job on the Savannah River on Wednesday and, two days later, was in Hanahan, South Carolina. Once preparations are complete, it will head about 7,000 miles toward Asia aboard a Russian Antonov 225 cargo plane, which is considered among the world's biggest aircrafts. The U.S. Department of Energy had been using the big pumper at a mixed oxide fuel plant construction site in southeastern Georgia. Eventually, nuclear waste is to be disposed of here. But the decision was made to transfer it to Japan -- along with several other such large pumps, from around the world -- in order to deal with a disaster that has been brewing since a March 11 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc at the plant and stoked fears about massive releases of radiation. ""I use the pump every day at the river site, but they're trying to avert a situation that worsens each day,"" said Jerry Ashmore, the owner of Ashmore Concrete Contractors that supplies concrete for the Savannah River facility. ""They need all this equipment. They need help."" Company officials say the prep work should be done by this weekend. Then, Georgia's transportation department must sign off on necessary highway and bridge permits, which are required due to the pumper truck's immensity. Eventually, it will be driven south to Atlanta, to be ideally flown out of the country by next Friday. Ashmore didn't have all the details about how the concrete pump will be used once it gets to Japan, though he understood its first mission will be to pump water into the stricken facility's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools to prevent overheating and the further emission of radioactive material. ""I understand it will be used to pump water into the reactor and later they can use it for concrete operations that need to be done,"" said Ashmore. The big pump, one of a handful of such trucks built by the the German company Putzmeister, appears to be tailor-made for this type of project -- especially in a radioactive environment. Its 70-meter boom can be controlled remotely, which should allow it to disperse cooling water in pinpointed locations over a large distance, say experts. Typically trucks this massive are used in large projects using concrete, such as the construction of bridges or high-rise buildings. According to Putzmeister's website, the company has already re-directed a truck-mounted concrete pump from an unknown location in Southeast Asia to head to the Fukushima Daiichi site, which is 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Another smaller Putzmeister pumper, currently in Los Angeles, is also being readied to fly to Japan. This is not the first time the German company's large concrete pumps have been utilized to help address a nuclear crisis. In 1986, 11 Putzmeister concrete pumps were used after the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine, then a part of the Soviet Union. The reactors' core were encased in massive amounts of concrete, to prevent the further release of any more radiation.","A 190,000-pound truck pump is now in South Carolina, being prepped to fly out of Atlanta .

1121,"(CNN) -- An outbreak of the H1N1 virus, known commonly as the swine flu, has hit the Venezuelan Andean state of Merida, the country's health minister said, the state-run AVN news agency reported. More than 100 cases of H1N1 have been recorded in Venezuela as of Tuesday, Eugenia Sader said. In Merida alone there are 56 cases which have tested positive for the virus, and special precautions have been put in place in that state, AVN reported. Classes in Merida have been canceled for five days, and a ban has been placed on events at night clubs and other closed-in venues, the agency reported. The health minister asked for calm Tuesday, saying that while the outbreak was confirmed, there was not an epidemic in the country. The most recent global pandemic was the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, in which the estimates of deaths ranged as high as 12,500 in the United States alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","There is an outbreak of the H1N1 virus in Merida state, the health minister says .

1122,"(CNN) -- Sean Kingston is walking around Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital eight days after he was brought there in critical condition following a personal-watercraft crash, the publicist for Epic Records said Monday. Kingston, 21, has been upgraded to serious condition, publicist Joe Carozza said. ""Sean is breathing on his own and walked for the first time this morning,"" Carozza said. Two sources close to the hip-hop artist told CNN last week that doctors expected Kingston to need about six weeks to recover. He suffered a broken jaw, a fractured wrist and water in his lungs, according to the sources, who both asked not to be identified since they were not authorized to speak to the media. Cassandra Sanchez, 23, was riding on the Sea Doo personal watercraft with Kingston when it crashed into a Miami bridge on May 29, according to an accident report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Sanchez was also injured and hospitalized. Kingston had bought the Sea Doo just days before, as he was moving into a new house in Miami, one of the sources said. His life vest apparently fell off during the crash, causing him to sink below the water, according to witnesses. ""They were calling us over, telling us, 'He's drowning, he's drowning,' "" said Carmen Rivera, who was boating nearby with her husband, Jonathan Rivera, and friend Jimmy Vega. The three rescuers were interviewed by CNN affiliate WSVN-TV. ""We jumped in the water to help him keep his head above water,"" Vega said. ""I pushed him up, and he was vomiting what seemed like water, and then there was some blood coming out,"" Jonathan Rivera said. The Miami-born artist changed his name from Kisean Anderson to Kingston to reflect his Jamaican heritage. He shot to fame in 2007 when his debut song ""Beautiful Girls"" became a No. 1 hit in the United States. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Sean Kington's condition is upgraded to serious, his publicist says .

1123,"Tokyo (CNN) -- The number of suicides in Japan hit a two-year high in the month of May, according to data released Wednesday by the nation's authorities. For the first time in two years, the monthly suicide number topped 3,000 in the month of May, the National Police Agency said. The report says suicides in Japan totaled 3,281 in May 2011, up nearly 20% from the same month last year. The spike reverses a steady decline in the number of suicides since the end of last year, when the government launched a national public awareness campaign. Japan was struck by a devastating earthquake and tsunami on March 11, and continues to grapple with a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. National suicide figures increased the two months following the disaster, the figures show. The most populous region of Tokyo saw the highest number of suicides in May at 325, the agency said. In the area hit hardest by the nuclear crisis, Fukushima saw 19 more suicides in May 2011 compared with May last year, with a total of 68. The tsunami-devastated prefecture of Miyagi showed no change in its suicide numbers and Iwate prefecture saw a decline of three. Northern Japan, which was devastated by the tsunami, had the highest rate of suicide in the country in 2010, according to the police agency. Iwate prefecture in 2010 had the second-highest suicide rate. Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures last year had a higher suicide rate than Tokyo. Japan's suicide rate remains one of the highest among developed nations, according to the World Health Organization.","Monthly suicide number tops 3,000 for the first time in two years .

1124,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan will likely need two to three more months to bring an end to the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a nuclear industry official said Saturday. Takashi Sawada, the deputy director of the Atomic Energy Society of Japan, said Saturday that it was likely to take that long to restore normal cooling systems for the damaged reactors at Fukushima Daiichi. The plant's coolant systems were knocked out by the March 11 tsunami, causing three reactors to overheat and producing what Japan's government has designated a top-scale nuclear accident. Sawada's organization is an association of nuclear engineers, scientists and professors, and it issued a Friday report that he called ""our best effort to imagine what the core looks like."" That report concluded that the zirconium alloy sheaths that surround the reactor's fuel rods ruptured in the three units, sending pellets of molten uranium tumbling to the bottom of the reactors. The pellets are since believed to have cooled and solidified at the reactor bases, according to the report. The plant's owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, has said it can't provide a timeline for bringing the crisis to an end and would not discuss Sawada's assessment Saturday. ""We are trying to do our utmost at this moment,"" a company official told CNN. But an adviser to Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the government wants to see some sort of plan by the end of April. ""We will set up a goal for the cooling process soon,"" the adviser, Goshi Hosono, said during an appearance on the BS Asahi satellite network Saturday morning. Japanese nuclear regulators declared the Fukushima Daiichi accident a Level 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale this week, putting the crisis on par with the April 1986 fire and explosion at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet Union. While authorities said the amount of radioactivity released was only 10 percent of the amount that spewed from Chernobyl, it was far beyond the threshold for a Level 7 event. More than 78,000 people who lived within 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) of the plant were ordered to flee their homes. Another 60,000-plus living in the next 10 kilometers were told to shelter indoors, And Japan's government ordered residents of several towns outside that danger zone that they would soon be evacuating due to the possibility of long-term health risks from radioactive particles released from the plant. Tokyo Electric has said it has to drain highly radioactive water from the basements and service tunnels of the reactor units' turbine plants before it can work on restoring normal cooling systems. But workers are also pumping up to 7 tons (1,850 gallons) of water into the reactors every hour as an interim measure, and an unknown portion of that is leaking back into the plant. At the plant on Saturday, workers continued preparations to start pumping water from the No. 2 turbine plant into a treatment facility for low-level radioactive waste. More than 9,000 tons of less-contaminated water that had been held there was dumped into the Pacific Ocean last week in what Japanese officials called an emergency measure to make room for fluid that had been leaking into the sea until April 6. Crews have been laying fresh pipes to the treatment center and hope to start transferring water from unit 2 on Sunday, the company said. But its capacity could be only a fraction of the volume now sloshing around in the turbine building basements, and engineers are still pouring hundreds of tons of water into the reactors every day to keep them cool. The treatment center could hold up to 30,000 tons of water, Tokyo Electric said -- but that could be only a fraction of the volume now sloshing around in the turbine building basements, the company said.","Industry group report says normal cooling may take 2 to 3 months .

1125,"Tokyo (CNN) -- The Japanese company trying to contain the release of radiation from its Fukushima nuclear plant must pour enough water to cool its damaged reactors without creating an overflow of contaminated water from the plant, a government official said Tuesday. Yukio Edano, Japan's chief Cabinet secretary and the government's point man for the nation's nuclear crisis, said the effort to prevent the reactors from overheating ""must be given priority."" But Edano acknowledge the danger posed by continuing to pour water into them. ""If we need to increase water injection, this is what we need to do.  If we stop water injection, fuel rod temperatures may increase and that may result in overheating,"" Edano said.  ""But fundamentally we need to drain the water as soon as possible."" Edano's remarks came a day after he told reporters that the containment structure surrounding one of the reactors at a quake-battered nuclear power plant is damaged and may be leaking radioactive material. The plant's owner disclosed that small amounts of plutonium had been found among contaminants around the facility late Monday as Japanese authorities struggled to explain how radioactive water was leaking into maintenance tunnels and possibly, into the Pacific Ocean. Edano told reporters Monday afternoon that ""there may be a leak"" from the containment vessel surrounding the No. 2 reactor. He said experts were still trying to determine the condition of the reactor's pressure vessel, which sits inside the containment vessel and immediately surrounds the radioactive fuel rods at the reactor's core. ""Somehow, we understand water is being moved from one place to another,"" Edano said. ""We need to hear an explanation from experts."" Reactors 1 to 3 at the plant, located about 240 kilometers (140 miles) north of Tokyo, are believed to have suffered core damage after their cooling systems were knocked out by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that ravaged northern Japan. The tsunami knocked out backup generators that ran their coolant systems and damaged water pumps at the plant, forcing workers to scramble to prevent a meltdown. Technicians restored external electric power late Monday to the No. 3 reactor plant, a step toward restoring cooling systems there, the plant's owner reported late Monday. But hydrogen explosions -- an early symptom of core damage -- inflicted heavy damage on the buildings housing the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors in the days following the quake, and another suspected explosion rocked the No. 2 reactor on March 15. Japanese nuclear regulators and the owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, say they know little about what damage was sustained in that blast. Tokyo Electric announced late Monday that plutonium -- a reactor byproduct that is also part of the fuel mix in the No. 3 reactor -- had turned up in soil on the plant grounds in tests taken last week. However, the company said it was equivalent to the amounts that fell on Japan following above-ground nuclear weapons tests by other countries in past decades, and posed no health risk to humans. ""Just in case, TEPCO will increase the monitoring of the nuclear plant grounds and the surrounding environment,"" the company said. Three plutonium isotopes -- Pu-238, -239 and -240 -- were found in soil at five different points inside the plant grounds, Tokyo Electric reported. The element can be a serious health hazard if inhaled or ingested, but external exposure poses little health risk, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The company said the discovery would not change efforts to bring an end to the crisis at the plant, which has spread radioactive contamination across much of northern Japan. Water found in a maintenance tunnel leading to unit No. 2's turbine house remained radioactive enough to pose an immediate hazard, authorities reported after taking new readings Monday afternoon. The 1,000 millisievert per hour reading is more than 330 times the dose an average person in a developed country receives per year and can result in vomiting and up to a 30 percent higher risk of cancer, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The level is also four times the top dose Japan's Health Ministry has set for emergency workers struggling to control the further emission of radioactive material from the damaged plant. Cham Dallas, an expert on radiation and public health at the University of Georgia, told CNN's ""American Morning"" that the level suggests operators are facing ""a deteriorating situation"" at the No. 2 reactor. ""Fortunately, that's in the reactor area, not outside and not in Tokyo or even in the area in Fukushima province,"" Dallas said. ""But in the reactor area itself, that's -- that's concerning to me. We're starting to see levels now that are dangerous to reactor workers if they're in those contaminated areas."" The officials said it was unclear how contaminated water got into the tunnel, or if it might have spilled out and seeped into the Pacific Ocean from there. ""Right now, it is not known,"" Hidehiko Nishiyama, an official with Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said  Monday evening. Water was being pumped out of the No. 1 and No. 2 turbine building, but Nishiyama noted that there is no place to put water pooled in the No. 2 building's basement. The plan is to extract the water using what he called a condenser. But that apparatus is ""almost full,"" as are several storage tanks nearby. A similar challenge is holding up the removal of collected water in the No. 3 unit's turbine building basement. ""So we will first have to empty some of the tanks,"" he said, adding later only that the tainted water needs to be removed ""as soon as possible."" Seawater readings from a monitoring post 330 meters (361 yards) into the Pacific Ocean showed elevated readings of the reactor byproduct iodine-131, an isotope that loses half its radioactivity every eight days. The measurement was taken north of the discharge canal for reactors 1-4, where a reading of 1,850 times normal was recorded Sunday. And despite reduced alarms in recent days, Nishiyama noted Monday that the temperature is rising inside the No. 1 reactor -- a sign that the nuclear fuel rods in that unit remain in danger of overheating. Units 1, 2 and 3 were the only three of the six reactors operating when the magnitude 9 earthquake struck. The quake and resulting tsunami knocked out backup generators that ran their coolant systems and damaged water pumps at the plant, leaving authorities scrambling to pump water into the reactors and the spent fuel pools to prevent a meltdown. Authorities have switched from pumping seawater into the reactors to using fresh water, and plan to switch from seawater to fresh water in the spent fuel pools, where old fuel rods are stored. Monday was the 32nd anniversary of the worst U.S. nuclear accident, a partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island power plant outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Though no deaths or injuries resulted, the accident hamstrung the American atomic power industry for decades.

1126,"New York (CNN) -- A 10-year-old boy escaped out of the window of a sinking minivan after his mother drove the vehicle with her three other children into the Hudson River, some 60 miles north of New York City, authorities said. Lashaun Armstrong swam to shore Tuesday night and was picked up by a passer-by and brought to a nearby fire station in Newburgh, New York, said Fire Chief Michael Vatter. Soaking wet and suffering from a mild case of hypothermia, Armstrong then told fire officials his mother had driven the vehicle into the river. Police divers later discovered the bodies of Lashanda Armstrong, 25, an 11-month-old girl, a 2-year-old boy and a 5-year-old boy some 25 yards off shore. A police investigation into the incident suggests that the mother intentionally drove the vehicle into the water, according to Newburgh Police Chief Michael Ferrara. Responders, using dive teams and a circling helicopter, found the van after an hourlong search submerged in eight feet of murky water, according to Vatter. Before the incident, a relative called police reporting a ""domestic disturbance"" that police say may have involved Armstrong's husband, Jean Pierre. That belief is based on a phone call the relative received in which they said they heard ""tussling in the background,"" noting a history of domestic problems, police said in a statement Wednesday. Police declined to identify the relative. An autopsy on the four bodies is scheduled for Wednesday. Newburgh Mayor Nicholas Valentine said the incident is certain to have ""a lasting effect on this city."" City resident and neighbor Christine Santos said she ""would never have imagined (Lashanda) to do this to her kids."" ""To them little babies. I would have never have imagined. I'm in shock,"" she added. Other neighbors described her surviving son, Lashaun, as responsible. ""He was the type of kid that was responsible for his little ones,"" said resident Carmen Davila. But the traumatic effects of Tuesday's incident could have long-term effects on the boy, analysts say. ""He has this major traumatic event and loss and that can be manifested in many ways,"" said Dr. Louis Baptista, director of Columbia University's Clinical Services for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. He warned of ""aggressive behavior, through violence, through depression, through depressive symptoms and that can be quite severe and quite impairing in a child his age.""

1127,"(CNN) -- The state of New Jersey is imposing harsher restrictions on Ferris wheel safety after an 11-year-old rider fell to her death earlier this month. Officials are mandating riders be at least 54 inches to ride without supervision, according to a letter from Michael Triplett of the New Jersey Carnival and Amusement Ride Safety Unit. Triplett also ""strongly recommended"" that each car have at least two riders, and added that if a manufacturer has a more strict requirement, that requirement should be followed. The changes coincide with the release of a preliminary report into the death of Abiah Jones of Pleasantville, New Jersey, who fell at Morey's Piers Mariner's Landing Pier, in Wildwood, on June 3. Jones, who met a 54-inch height requirement, was on a school trip when she fell from one of the park's main attractions, called The Great Wheel. After receiving first aid at the scene, she was taken to Cape Regional Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead. How the girl fell is still undetermined, and officials have no eyewitnesses, according to a report by the state of New Jersey. Surveillance footage showed her during the fall but did not show her leaving the gondola, the report said. It determined she entered the ride as a single rider and sustained ""significant head trauma as well as cuts on her arms and shoulders,"" hitting several objects on her way to the ground. The findings also concluded operators had no knowledge of any problems, the ride had no mechanical defects, and no other problems had been reported in its 25-year history. ""The fact that Abiah Jones was alone in the gondola, without any nearby passengers, may have led her to take a risk that she would have been convinced not to take if there were other riders in the gondola,"" the state investigator concluded. At 156 feet, the ride is one of the tallest wheels on the East Coast, Morey Piers spokeswoman Lindsey Young told CNN.","Riders must be 54 inches tall to ride without supervision, new rules mandate .

1128,"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- At least one miner is fighting acute pneumonia, two will need dental surgery, and others have skin problems or lesions in their eyes. Yet for all the 33 miners' challenges the past 69 days, trapped a half-mile underground in the San Jose mine without light, health care and other basics, those who have emerged appear surprisingly healthy, Chile's health minister said. ""Things are extraordinarily well, better than expected,"" Jaime Manalich said Wednesday. ""They really are in good condition -- emotional condition and physical condition."" After getting out of the capsule, each miner stood up and reconnected with loved ones. Some of them engaged the throngs nearby. Within minutes, though, all were placed on stretchers and whisked away to get medical care. While Manalich said ""no major problems"" have been found, all the rescued miners will be carefully monitored at a nearby hospital in the coming hours and days. Experts said some of the aftereffects of the long stay underground and quick trip to the surface -- especially mental effects, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or restless nights -- may be felt for years to come. The miners do not have to be flown to Copiapo Regional Hospital, Manalich said. However, officials strongly recommended it, and the miners have agreed to go, he said. Many of the miners rescued by late Wednesday afternoon had few evident medical problems, Manalich said, and dizziness was not a problem because the rescue capsule did not rotate as much as officials feared. Even so, all of the miners will be evaluated by specialists, including ophthalmologists, dermatologists and psychologists. They are being housed in a brand-new ward that was completed two months before the August 5 collapse at the San Jose mine. The hospital has spent weeks preparing for the miners, said hospital director Hernan Rojas. ""We've been ready since Day One of this disaster,"" he said last month. Some miners may be released as early as Thursday afternoon, Manalich said, while others will stay longer at the hospital. That includes at least two men who need dental surgery and one miner, whom Manalich would not identify, who is expected to remain hospitalized through the weekend. That miner's symptoms emerged four days ago, and he was already being treated with antibiotics and improving about 24 hours before being brought to the surface, Manalich said. Besides physical maladies, in the coming days doctors will keep an eye out for nightmares, panic attacks, anxiety and claustrophobia, among other potential issues. They must be reintegrated with their families and society and deal with their sudden celebrity status and media attention. One expert has said the specter of post-traumatic stress disorder looms large. Dr. Michael Duncan, the deputy chief medical officer at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, told CNN, ""The work is just beginning when the miners get out of the mine."" If the miners are given a clean bill of health, they will be released to their families. Some concerns linger due to their lack of sunlight, nutrition questions, the effects of their confinement, lack of sleep and sanitation issues. Because they have been isolated for so long, they could be more susceptible to the common cold or other viruses. Extensive precautions were taken to minimize health risks before the miners were rescued. Two Chilean Army nurses were sent down to the mine ahead of all the miners' rescue to help them prepare for their trip to the surface, Manalich said. One of them focused exclusively on the miner with pneumonia, who had an oxygen mask on his face when he came up. ""They have an anemic condition, and right now they have been sleeping less these last few days,"" Manalich said earlier Wednesday. ""They're tired and they still have long hours of waiting in order to be able to come up to the surface and to meet with their families."" The miners were switched to a liquid diet six hours before their rescue in case they vomit on the way up. Because Chilean Mining Minister Laurence Golborne was concerned about the miners being reintroduced to sunlight abruptly, special sunglasses were sent down for the men to wear to make sure they don't suffer damage to their retinas. While underground, they were given special clothing that pulls sweat away from the body because of concern about skin infections, as well as special socks to help prevent infections like athlete's foot. They also had a series of vaccinations including a tetanus booster and flu shot. They have been exercising daily, and one miner, Yonni Barrios, is a paramedic who has been weighing his colleagues daily and taking blood tests and daily urine samples. American astronaut Jerry Linenger knows something about isolation and confinement. He says his five months in space aboard the Russian space station Mir left him weak and with bone loss. ""Down in the mines you have gravity pulling you down. There will be disorientation -- turning your head will feel like doing 100 backflips in a row,"" he said. The miners that have come up are showing slight increases in blood pressure and cardiac activity during the trip, but they recovered satisfactorily after a few minutes of rest and have not required medication, Manalich said. The health minister added later that, emotionally, he was surprised by how well the men were doing. Still, experts warn that psychological adjustments may remain a hurdle for the miners. ""These men spent 20 days totally cut off in the dark until the first bore hole was made,"" Linenger said. ""So they were in survival mode, which is tough psychologically because you are in a life-and-death situation.""

1129,"(CNN) -- People up and down the Mississippi River could feel the effects from this week's epic flooding long after the water recedes. Farmers may face a major disruption to their livelihood in places where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opens spillways to drain water from the swollen river onto adjacent land. ""If you have a pasture where you grow soybeans and it gets flooded by 25 feet of floodwaters and you end up with 3 feet of oozing mud on top of your pasture, it's going to be a long time before you can plow -- certainly one year,"" said Sam Bentley, a professor of sedimentary geology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. ""It might be arable next year, but it would probably be quite difficult to work."" There's also a chance that floodwaters could spill into wetlands and damage oyster beds near where the Mississippi River meets the Gulf of Mexico. ""They don't like to be buried in mud,"" said Ivor van Heerden of the oysters.  Van Heerden is former deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center and now a private consultant. How bad will it be in Louisiana, where the swollen Mississippi is headed? Experts held out hope that the floodwaters forecast for much of the Lower Mississippi River will exact a minimum toll in lives lost. Yet they appeared resigned to the likelihood of steep property losses. If a system of levees holds, then floodwater will be discharged only where the Corps of Engineers plans to discharge water, Bentley said. ""There will be property lost, hopefully no lives, but according to a plan executed by the Corps of Engineers as opposed to a rapidly unfolding catastrophe,"" he said. A failure in the system of levees would change the landscape considerably, he said, though he does not expect that. ""I wouldn't say that this is going to be a disaster, but the modern Mississippi levee system has never been tested under flood conditions like this,"" he said. ""It's probably going to exceed water levels not seen since the Great Flood of 1927 -- historically the largest ever measured."" That flood led Congress in 1928 to authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to build the system of levees and other controls now under stress. Farmers in parts of Louisiana could face a long recovery, particularly if authorities open the Morganza Spillway near Baton Rogue to lower water levels on the Mississippi River. Roy Dakka, a professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of the Center for Geoinformatics at Louisiana State University, predicted it will take weeks to months for the farmland to dry. ""Any existing crops are going to be toast,"" he said, citing the fields of corn, sugar cane and soybeans that will be covered with sediment. ""Plus, God knows what's in the water and what gets deposited."" If the floodwaters remain on the ground for 30 days or so, ""then we probably would not be able to get a crop in this year,"" said Roger Carter, president of Agricultural Management Services, an agricultural consultant firm in Clayton, Louisiana. ""Most of our crops are already planted in the floodplains. They would be destroyed."" He said he was comfortable that the levee would hold, but added that, if it breaks, ""that would be a catastrophe ... it could be years before we could replace that infrastructure."" Any farmers who wind up losing a year's worth of crops will likely be forced out of the business, since insurance would not cover their losses adequately, he said. In all, Bentley predicted, the floods will affect three major areas in the Lower Mississippi Delta, which begins around Baton Rouge and ends in the Gulf of Mexico. Some 80 miles north of Baton Rouge, the Atchafalaya River diverges from the Mississippi and flows down to the Gulf. The entire Atchafalaya Basin will get from 5 feet to 25 feet of water going down the Atchafalaya, whose surroundings are less populated than the area around the Mississippi River. ""It's a safer place to discharge water in terms of the human cost,"" he said. ""At the same time, there are tens of thousands of people who live there."" The second area of significance is Lake Pontchartrain, a major estuary north of New Orleans that will receive floodwater from the Bonnet Carre Spillway. Bentley predicted that the fertilizer and waste deposited in Lake Pontchartrain will result in ""extensive"" blooms of algae by midsummer. ""This is essentially a large, unplanned sediment transport experiment,"" he said, adding that he plans to study how effectively coastal bays, lakes and estuaries trap sediment to build new land. The ratio of how much is deposited versus how much is washed out by tides determines how fast land can be built, ""which is what we need to do in order to rebuild the Mississippi River Delta,"" he said. The third area is the Mississippi River below New Orleans, which is protected by ""very low and relatively weak levees,"" Bentley said. Though the area is largely unpopulated, it is a major navigational channel. Were any place in the Mississippi River system to experience a breach in a levee, that could lead to a change in the river channel, he said. He pointed to areas near the town of Port Sulphur as particularly vulnerable. ""Those are areas where the levees get low and weak."" Under the best-case scenario, the Army Corps of Engineers will prove able to manage the water flow and flooding will be minor. But there is little doubt that property will be lost and the economy will take a hit, Dakka said. ""On the other hand, the worst-case scenario is that the water rises, we're not able to manage it, it finds the weak areas, exploits those vulnerabilities, perhaps even segments of the river levee get taken out by erosion or collapse due to failure of saturated levees or other things could happen -- ships get loose in the river, barges of chemicals run into the side of the levee."" If levees break, weeks could pass before engineers could reseal them, he said. But Dakka said his worst-case scenario might not tell the whole story. ""There are unintended consequences that are going to happen that we can't possibly even fathom right now,"" he said. ""We just have to be ready for it, and get people out of the way."" If wide-scale flooding occurs, the resulting economic damage will be felt for years, he predicted. ""Any city that ever floods never really returns economically to where it once was because people don't have confidence, people don't want to put businesses there. New Orleans is the big example."" Already, even before the slow-motion disaster has unfolded, policymakers should have learned some lessons, he said. One of them is that flood plains should not have been developed. ""Nature wins in the end,"" he said, ""And I just hope that we've done enough planning that we can basically at least hold it back this one more time."" ""We should really be thinking about whether we want to continue to live in really stupid places, because nature is going to exploit our stupidity,"" Dakka said.","Hope prevails that the levee system for the Mississippi River will hold .

1130,"(CNN) -- Firefighters have stopped the northward advance of the second-largest wildfire in recorded Arizona history and are now focusing on its eastern flank, crossing the New Mexico border to build suppression lines meant to starve the flames into submission, authorities said Monday. Light winds after dark and an atmospheric inversion will hold smoke at the surface overnight going into Tuesday morning, authorities said. The Wallow Fire has burned 706 square miles, officials said Monday, up from 694 square miles the day before. The fire remains about 10% contained. Calmer winds were helping firefighters get the upper hand on the fire, which has been burning since late May, said Jerome MacDonald, the operations chief for the Southwest Incident Management team. Efforts to return residents to Greer, part of which was burned in the fire, are under way, said Fire Chief Mark Wade. ""Greer is not as bad as a lot of people are making it sound,"" he said. But he warned that there are dangerous obstacles that must be cleared and utilities to be restored before residents can be allowed back in. Residents were already moving back to the towns of Springerville, Eagar and South Fork after authorities lifted evacuation orders on Sunday. Authorities warned residents of the towns, about 170 miles east-northeast of Phoenix, that air quality could continue to be a problem, and food in refrigerators may have spoiled. But officials with both cities disputed a state suggestion that water supplies might be contaminated. ""Our water is pure, and it always has been,"" said Springerville town manager Steve West. Vicki Walker of Eagar has made up her mind to return, according to her husband, Kelvin. She, her daughter and her grandson were leaving Phoenix for home Monday morning, Kelvin Walker said. ""She's elated to be getting back this soon,"" said Walker, who stayed behind while his family evacuated. The Wallow Fire is the second-largest recorded fire in state history, having burned across a land mass roughly equivalent to an area one and a half times the city of Phoenix. The 2002 Rodeo/Chediski fire, Arizona's largest recorded wildfire, burned more than 731 square miles of eastern Arizona. Fire officials said Sunday that they had turned a corner in stopping the fire, which started as May 29 in the Apache National Forest, according to authorities. Walker said he remained in part to keep an eye on the family's two-acre homestead. However, the main reason he didn't evacuate with his family was because his elderly aunt and uncle refused to budge, and he felt compelled to stay and look after them. ""It was really strange,"" Walker said. ""If you chose to stay rather than evacuate, you had to sign a waiver and say you would not leave your property."" Walker didn't stay home. He ventured out into the ghost town, not to disobey but to help out, he said. He said he took training to become a runner for firefighters on the front lines. Among them is his 26-year-old son, Kyran, who is a seasonal firefighter for the U.S. Forest Service, Walker said. ""He was one of the first responders. He's been working 12 to 16 to 18 hours a day since the fire started,"" Walker said. ""I stayed home and fed him every night. I think he took (the fire) fairly personal."" So did Walker's neighbors. Before evacuation, many left signs in the front yards in support of the firefighters. ""The signs said things like 'We love you. We appreciate you. Be safe!' "" Walker said. On Sunday, according to CNN affiliate KNXV, a flashing sign posted on the road into Springerville read, ""We missed you. Welcome home."" Electricity has been restored to the towns of Nutrioso and part of Alpine, southeast of Greer. More than 100 law enforcement officers are working with the incident to ensure public and firefighter safety, as well as protect residents' property during evacuations, authorities said Monday evening. CNN's Phil Gast and journalist Craig Johnson contributed to this report.","NEW: Light winds Monday night keep smoke at bay .

1131,"(CNN) -- The Monument fire, which has scorched 40 homes in southern Arizona, has quite an arsenal to use against firefighters. At 9,300 acres Thursday, the blaze is roaring in the Huachuca Mountains near the Mexican border, just south of Sierra Vista, Arizona. It is only 17% contained. ""This whole part of the country is in extreme drought,"" said Dale Thompson, a spokesman for fire crews. ""Grass will take off like gasoline."" Red-flag warnings indicated that the region was at the mercy of heat, low humidity and wind gusts up to 35 miles per hour. Evacuations were ordered in some neighborhoods, and other residents were told they may have to leave, local officials said. Portions of a major highway were closed on the edge of the Coronado National Memorial/Coronado National Forest. Meanwhile, crews battled the massive Wallow fire in eastern Arizona on several fronts Thursday as they dealt with strong winds and low relative humidity. The raging blaze started last month in eastern Arizona, devouring hundreds of thousands of acres before spilling into New Mexico. It has grown into the largest fire ever in Arizona, according to fire officials. It had burned 478,016 acres and was 29% contained as of Thursday afternoon, officials said. The National Weather Service issued a wind advisory for the area Thursday, warning of strong and gusty winds in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were at 5 to 12 percent, it said. The Wallow fire -- centered in a sparsely populated national forest -- is the largest but not the state's most destructive in terms of property. It has destroyed 32 homes and 36 outbuildings, including sheds and barns, compared with the 468,000-acre Rodeo-Chediski fire, which destroyed 465 homes. On Thursday, firefighters focused on hazard tree removal, structure protection, improving containment lines and conducting mop-up activities, officials said. Authorities have lifted a nearly two-week-long evacuation order for the 200-plus residents of the community of Nutrioso. Officials with an interagency team fighting the blaze lifted the evacuation order issued June 2 for the town, allowing those with identification showing that they live there to return Wednesday. Leighayn Green returned with her husband and their 13-year-old daughter to their undamaged home. They stayed in different communities, at times with friends and once in lodging provided by a stranger. ""There is a kindness being extended back and forth between communities,"" Green said after she returned home.

1132,"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- With expectations of change running high, former bad-boy pop star Michel Martelly was sworn in Saturday as the president of impoverished Haiti, still reeling from last year's devastating earthquake. In a sign of the nation's troubles, the electricity went out moments before the inauguration, prompting formally dressed dignitaries and guests -- including former U.S. President Bill Clinton and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe -- to fan themselves to stave off rising May heat. Immediately, Twitter lit up with posts calling the blackout a ""bad sign."" Despite the outage, the ceremony proceeded before parliament and Martelly took his oath of office amid the lights of media cameras. Martelly, savvy in social media, tweeted his own inauguration as Haiti's 56th president minutes after it happened along with a flurry of messages expressing hope that change would now come to Haiti. Outside, thousands of Haitians rejoiced at what they see as a new start for their country, where many people remain displaced from their homes and post-quake reconstruction has been slow, one of the reasons popular discontent with the former administration had grown. The collective joy surfaced in a nation that has been subjected to months of misery compounded by a cholera epidemic that erupted last October. Port-au-Prince was under strict security all day Saturday, with United Nations peacekeepers out in force on street corners. ""Today is a big day for us,"" said Jolina Desroches, 40. ""Before, (Martelly) was just the president of Kompa (a Haitian musical genre). Today, he is the president of the Haitian people."" Dressed in a dark suit and red tie, Martelly stepped outside after the ceremony draped in the presidential sash. Supporters hoping for a glimpse of the new president climbed up flag polls over the United Nations plaza where the ceremony took place and pressed against barriers, as vendors took advantage of the crowd to sell plantain chips and bananas. After attending a lengthy Roman Catholic Mass in his honor, Martelly made his first speech as president on Saturday afternoon from a temporary stage in front of the collapsed National Palace, an iconic symbol of Haiti's struggles. He promised change, emphasizing the need to improve public safety to facilitate investment -- saying that, ""with insecurity, the country cannot work. ... Money cannot (stay in the system), which means there isn't work and the misery is worse."" The new president also reaffirmed his campaign promise to offer free education to young Haitians. The entire address was in Creole, except for one part seemingly aimed at encouraging the international community to come to and invest in the Caribbean nation: ""A new Haiti (is) open for business now!"" Thousands who had gathered outside the palace gates -- where a massive tent city still fills the capital's central plaza, as it has since the epic earthquake -- cheered the president's remarks. Martelly has acknowledged his task as herculean in nature. He has pledged to fight corruption and institute measures of transparency. He told CNN last month that one of his first actions as president would be to nominate high court judges. Creating an independent judiciary will send an important signal, he said. ""We have to establish a rule of law,"" he said. ""We want justice for everyone."" Martelly also vowed to end government corruption that has plagued Haiti for years. ""I am excited to take command and make the right decisions for my country,"" he said during a visit to Washington in April. In a message posted on Twitter after the inauguration, the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said it was looking forward to working with the new government to achieve a better future for Haitian people. Martelly's candidacy was unexpected -- he was better known as Sweet Micky, the kompa singer with flamboyant stage presence, but appealed to voters who had grown weary with the status quo.

1133,"(CNN) -- Nearly two weeks after the biggest wildfire in Arizona history swept through their community and obliterated dozens of homes, barns, sheds and one truck, residents of the tiny town of Greer are back in their homes. Greer residents were ordered to evacuate on June 6, two days before the Wallow Fire blew through their town of about 200 inhabitants and scorched at least 22 homes and 24 outbuildings.  Residents with proper identification were allowed to return Monday. Greer will be open to non-residents Tuesday, according to the Southwest Incident Management Team, which is leading the effort to battle the blaze. The lifting of the evacuation order comes as firefighters increasingly gain the upper hand on the blaze, which has torched more than a half-million acres in eastern Arizona. Firefighters announced late Monday that the blaze is now 56% contained. Meanwhile, weather conditions are expected to improve with calmer winds and higher humidity levels Tuesday, making it easier for crews to battle other active wildfires burning across the state. Over the weekend and on Monday, the flames appeared to outpace firefighters' efforts in some areas. That includes the Monument Fire in southern Arizona, which U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell has deemed the nation's No. 1 priority. Winds in the southern part of the state on Tuesday will be blowing between 5 mph and 10 mph, considerably slower than the 30-plus mph winds that hampered firefighting efforts over the weekend, the National Weather Service forecast. Nationwide, wildfires have burned almost as many acres in the first half of 2011 as were recorded by the National Interagency Fire Center for all of last year. The agency website reports 3.1 million acres in the United States had been ignited by wildfires as of May 31, compared with 3.2 million burned acres cited in the organization's year-end report in November 2010. CNN's Ed Payne and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Authorities allow residents of Greer, Arizona, to return to their homes .

1134,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor suffered another health setback Wednesday morning, the latest in a series of medical struggles for the 94-year-old actress, her husband said. ""She got into a little coma,"" Prince Frederic von Anhalt said. Gabor was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center Tuesday afternoon because the feeding tube inserted into her stomach was ""bleeding ... like a fountain,"" her spokesman said. She had been released from the same hospital a day earlier after being treated for pneumonia. Doctors were working hard on her Wednesday afternoon, von Anhalt said. ""She doesn't respond,"" Prince Frederic von Anhalt said. He said she is suffering from a stomach infection. Gabor, 94, has been in and out of the hospital many times in the past year. She underwent hip replacement surgery last summer and a leg amputation several months later. She has been unable to walk since a 2002 car accident. The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is famous for her many marriages and strong personality.

1135,"(CNN) -- ""Jackass"" star Ryan Dunn and a passenger in his car died of ""blunt and thermal trauma"" when the 2007 Porsche 911 GT3 crashed and caught fire on a Pennsylvania highway early Monday, according to the autopsy report released Tuesday. Police identified Ryan's passenger as Zachary Hartwell, a 30-year-old West Chester, Pennsylvania, man who once worked in one of Ryan's movies. West Goshen, Pennsylvania, Police Sgt. Joe Burt confirmed that accident investigators estimated Dunn's car was going faster than 100 mph. Toxicology results, which should show if Dunn was intoxicated, will not be available for several weeks, according to the Chester County coroner's office. The red-bearded Dunn, 34, was famous for his pranks and dangerous stunts on the show, which evolved into a successful film franchise. Hartwell worked as a stunt car driver on ""Minghads,"" a 2009 comedy directed by ""Jackass"" star Bam Margera and featuring Dunn, according to the Internet Movie Database. West Goshen, Police were called to the wreck scene on State Route 322 at 2:30 a.m. Monday, the police report said. ""Upon arrival, police located one vehicle off the road and in the woods that was fully engulfed in flames,"" the report said. ""Speed may have been a contributing factor to the accident,"" police said, although the investigation is in its preliminary stages. Dunn was driving the Porsche, which was registered in his name, police said. A photo of Dunn was posted on his Twitter account about two hours before the wreck showing him with a drink in his hand.  Two men sitting with Dunn in the photo are not identified. The manager of Barnaby's in West Chester confirmed that the photo was taken in his bar Sunday night.  The bar is about a mile away from where Dunn was killed in a car crash. Manager Jim O'Brien confirmed that Dunn was drinking there. ""He didn't seem to be intoxicated at the time he left,"" O'Brien said.  ""Ryan was not a hardcore drinker, at least not when he was here."" O'Brien said Dunn was a regular customer and well known to his staff. ""He was a valuable person in our community and his death is a tragedy,"" O'Brien said.  ""He will be missed."" MTV issued a short statement through its Twitter account Monday morning:  ""We're deeply saddened by the passing of a member of the MTV family, Ryan Dunn. Our hearts and thoughts are with his friends and family."" ""Jackass"" star Johnny Knoxville tweeted his message Monday morning: ""Today I lost my brother Ryan Dunn. My heart goes out to his family and his beloved Angie. RIP Ryan, I love you buddy."" Dunn teamed up with ""Jackass"" co-star Steve-O for an episode of the NBC game show ""Minute to Win It"" that aired on June 8. He also hosted ""Proving Ground,"" which premiered on the G4 channel on June 14.","NEW: Dunn's car was going faster than 100 mph, police say .

1136,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Engineers will need six to nine months to bring the damaged nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant to heel, the plant's owners said Sunday in their first public timetable for ending the crisis. It will take three months to reduce the levels of radioactivity in the plant and restore normal cooling systems in the reactors and spent fuel pools, the Tokyo Electric Power Company announced. Another three to six months will be needed before the reactors are fully shut down and new shells are built around their damaged housings, the company said. Meanwhile, Japan's government said it would try to decontaminate ""the widest possible area"" in that period before deciding  whether the tens of thousands who have been forced to flee their homes will be allowed to return, said Goshi Hosono, an adviser to Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan. ""We have to go step by step in order to resolve the problems one by one,"" Hosono said. The timetable was released five days after Kan called for Tokyo Electric to show Japanese a pathway to ending the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. A day earlier, the company would not comment on an industry group's estimate that restoring normal cooling would take two to three months -- a period comparable to the first stage of Sunday's plan. Tokyo Electric spokesman Hiro Hasegawa acknowledged that public pressure helped speed the company's decision to release a plan and warned that the outline remained tentative -- ""but we will do our best"" to stick to it, he said. Because of the still-unknown volume of highly irradiated water flooding the basements of units 1-3, where the cooling equipment is normally housed, the utility is working toward building a separate cooling system. That system would remove heat from the water being pumped through the reactors and decontaminate it before circulating it back through them. Currently, engineers have improvised by pumping roughly 170 metric tons (45,000 gallons) of water a day into each reactor, an unknown portion of which is leaking out. The leaking water comes out full of such particles as radioactive iodine and cesium, the byproducts of the reactors. At the plant on Sunday, workers used remote-controlled robots to record radiation, water and temperature data in the building that houses reactor No. 3. Photos released by the utility showed the devices, provided by the U.S. company iRobot, opening the inner door to the reactor and entering the darkened building. ""Everything is a high-radiation area inside the reactor buildings,"" Hasegawa told reporters at a briefing for international news outlets -- another first for a company that has been sharply criticized for its handling of the crisis. Meanwhile, Tokyo Electric Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata fended off nearly a dozen questions from Japanese reporters about whether he or other top executives planned to resign as a result of the disaster. ""At this point, we do not have any decisions or discussions about resigning, as all our efforts is towards resolving the situation,"" Katsumata said. ""We are not sure if resigning is the best way to take the responsibility or to stay in position to resolve the situation."" Any decisions may wait until the company's general shareholders meeting in June, he said. The 5-week-old crisis began March 11, when the plant was swamped by the tsunami that followed northern Japan's historic earthquake. The 14- to 15-meter (45- to 48-foot) wave knocked out the plant's coolant systems, causing the three reactors operating at the time to overheat. The results included two spectacular explosions that blew apart the housings of the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors and the release of a massive amount of radioactivity that has shrunk considerably, but continued Sunday. The wild card in the utility's plan may be reactor No. 2, where another suspected buildup of hydrogen is believed to have ruptured the suppression pool -- a doughnut-shaped reservoir at the base of the reactor. That may make it more difficult to carry out one of the first stages of their planned cooling process, filling the concrete primary containment shell around the reactor pressure vessel with water, Hasegawa said. Unless that damage is repaired somehow, that part of the plan may be unsuccessful, he said. Tokyo Electric also plans to build a new structure to support the No. 4 unit's spent nuclear fuel pool, around which fires -- the cause of which has yet to be determined -- severely damaged a nearby building. Hosono said there is no indication this pool is compromised or leaking highly radioactive water or fumes, calling the planned structure a protective measure given concerns about considerable damage to the main No. 4 nuclear reactor building. Japan's government declared Fukushima Daiichi a top-scale nuclear disaster last week, warning residents of several towns outside the current 30-kilometer (19-mile)  danger zone around the plant to evacuate or prepare to leave their homes. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano visited the stricken area Sunday, including a brief trip into the 20-kilometer radius from which all residents have been ordered out. Clad in a white protective suit and face mask, Edano got within about 15 kilometers of the plant as he met with police who are still searching the area for victims of the March disaster. ""Ensuring people's livelihoods and security is our foremost priority,"" Edano said after meeting with the governor of Fukushima Prefecture, Yuhei Sato. Radiation levels in the area are not high enough to cause immediate health effects, but prolonged exposure could cause an increased risk of cancer, according to government data and reports from outside researchers. In Iitate, a village Edano visited Sunday, government figures released Sunday show cumulative doses of radiation since the accident are already more than half the 20-millisievert limit the government . set for long-term evacuations. Iitate is about 40 kilometers northwest of the plant, outside the danger zones drawn in the early days of the crisis. Hosono said the government does not yet know how much of the contaminated areas can be cleaned up, but added, ""We will try to decontaminate as much of an area as possible."" Workers stopped a severe leak of contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean on April 6, but elevated levels of the short-lived nuclear waste iodine-131 recorded over the weekend could indicate a new problem, a Japanese safety official announced Saturday. Iodine concentrations sampled Saturday around the No. 2 water intake were 6,000 times Japan's legal standards, up from 1,100 times on Thursday and down slightly from Friday's figure of 6,500 times. That number is far below the levels recorded when the earlier leak was spewing radioactive iodine into the ocean at 7.5 million times the limit. Authorities have built a silt and placed steel plates around the intake fence to corral the contamination since April 6. Iodine-131 has a radioactive half-life of eight days, and the increase could be either from a fresh leak or from sediment stirred up while placing steel panels around the intakes, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, the top spokesman for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. ""They will continue to monitor this carefully,"" Nishiyama said. ""At this point, they have not visually found any leakage of any water into the ocean, and it is hard to check the conditions around (reactor) No. 2 due to high radiation levels.""

1137,"(CNN) -- A 7-year old Michigan boy took a 20-mile drive in his stepfather's car, ending in a high-speed chase with local law enforcement, according to the Huron County Sheriff's office. Around 10 a.m. Monday, 911 dispatchers received multiple calls reporting what appeared to be a young child driving a red Pontiac across town. ""Uh, yes, I'm on Kinde Road outside of Caseville, and believe it or not, I just passed about a 5-, 6-year-old kid flying down the road with a red Pontiac Sunbird,"" one caller told the dispatcher as he tried to follow the speeding car. Eventually, the caller lost sight of the boy. According to Huron County Sheriff Kelly J. Hanson, the car was seen again minutes later in Caseville by another man who called 911. It was racing past a Dairy Queen restaurant. Based on details provided by 911 dispatchers, Huron County Sheriff's Deputy Randy Britt and Caseville Police Chief Jamie Learman began searching for the car. Hanson said Britt and Learman caught up to the young driver and attempted to stop the car, which officials said was driven as fast as 50 mph. The boy appeared to have difficulty pulling over and footage from Britt's dashboard camera shows the officers eventually had to box the car in to slow it down. According to Hanson, though stopped, the car was still running and in gear. The boy was upset, he said, and couldn't unlock the car door. Finally, officers were able to calm the child and get the door open. Britt put the vehicle in park. ""It was learned that the child had left his residence in his stepfather's vehicle, which is in the Sheridan Township area. He was heading for his father's residence in the Filion area,"" said Hanson. ""Deputy Britt called the child's mother and got her voicemail. She quickly returned the call and was unaware that her son was missing. Apparently, she had worked a night shift and had left instructions with the boy to be awakened at 10:00 a.m."" A deputy brought the mother to the car and her frightened son, where deputies arranged for them to go to the county Department of Human Services. ""We're waiting to hear back from DHS to see how to proceed if we need to, if there is any trouble in the home, any neglect,"" Hanson said. ""We won't release the parents' names until DHS has decided what to do, so we don't interfere with possible court proceedings."" No charges have been filed against the boy or his mother. According to Timothy J. Rutkowski, prosecuting attorney for the Huron County Prosecutor's Office, ""We're still in the process of looking over the report.""","911 caller reports ""kid flying down the road with a red Pontiac Sunbird""

1138,"(CNN) -- Thousands of firefighters battling to control dangerous wildfires in Arizona will get a small measure of relief this week as winds calm and humidity levels rise, the National Weather Service said Monday. Critical conditions are forecast Monday across large sections of New Mexico and Texas, and to a lesser extent in Oklahoma and Kansas. On Sunday, critical to extreme conditions could be found in those four states, plus Arizona, Colorado, Utah and Nevada. Arizona bore the brunt of Sunday's fiery conflagration as flames outpaced firefighters' efforts. The Monument Fire -- which U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell has deemed the nation's No. 1 priority, putting it first in line for any air, ground or other resources -- jumped Highway 92 late Sunday afternoon at Carr Canyon heading east, according to the Cochise County website. ""We've had a hard day today, with things that we didn't want to happen,"" fire spokesman Bill Paxton said Sunday night. ""The bull came out of the pen."" Thanks to dry, windy conditions, the fire broke through four contingency lines, including going over to the other side of the highway, said Paxton, part of the national Interagency Incident Management Team. ""Everything aligned for a massive push,"" he said. ""It's really hard on the community here."" The Cochise County Sheriff's Office broadened the evacuation zone east to the San Pedro River, reports InciWeb, an online interagency database that tracks fires, floods and other disasters. On Sunday evening, the website noted the fire had burned at least 26,956 acres and was 27% contained. More than 1,000 personnel -- as well as 100 engines and nine helicopters -- were battling that blaze, which had destroyed 44 homes and 18 other structures from its start June 12 through Sunday. The weather has hardly been cooperating in the fight, with humidity at 7% and temperatures topping 96 degrees. The National Weather Service forecast winds should weaken somewhat in the early part of this week, to between 7 mph and 13 mph in Sierra Vista, Arizona, though temperatures were still expected to remain in the 90s or higher all week. People living in Sierra Vista were ordered to leave Sunday while firefighters conducted burn-out operations in an attempt to stop the fire moving that way, CNN's Thelma Gutierrez reported from the area. Even as the flames spread, some Sierra Vista residents turned to their faith. ""There are disasters, calamities and tragedies,"" Tucson Bishop Gerald Kicanas said during a special weekend service at St. Andrew the Apostle Church, reported CNN affiliate KGUN-TV in Tucson. ""We are with them in solidarity,"" Kicanas said. ""We pray for an end to the fire, we pray for the safety of our firefighters and we pray that the monsoon rains will come and free us from these terrible fires that have been so devastating."" The church is taking donations for fire victims. Will Posko said he is housing several people in his home. ""Our hearts go out to those people,"" Posko told KGUN.  ""We all have to help one another in this community."" Parishioner Tom Felix said the community's spirit and support overwhelmed him. ""Coming here ... and just seeing everybody, my goodness that's beautiful faith,"" he told KGUN. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has issued emergency declarations for the Monument Fire and another blaze, Horseshoe II, making Cochise County eligible for $100,000 toward response and recovery expenses. In Texas, critical fire weather conditions were predicted across much of the state Monday, the Texas Forest Service said. The forest service is battling 20 wildfires, with 12 new large blazes reported Sunday. Some 500 homes are threatened in Jasper County, the service said, and 163 have been evacuated in Walker County. Nationwide, wildfires have burned almost as many acres in the first half of 2011 as were recorded by the National Interagency Fire Center for all of last year. The agency website reports 3.1 million acres in the United States had been ignited by wildfires as of May 31, compared with 3.2 million burned acres cited in the organization's year-end report in November 2010. One Arizona blaze that started May 29 has mushroomed into a historically large wildfire. Known as the Wallow Fire, it has burned 519,319 acres and was 51% contained as of Sunday evening. This fire caused power outages Sunday in Arizona cities Blue and parts of Alpine, Nutrioso and Greer, the Navopache Electric Cooperative reported on its website. Generators are powering some of the company's New Mexico customers as well as those in Alpine, Arizona. Residents of Luna, New Mexico, were ordered to evacuate Saturday afternoon after the blaze jumped containment lines along U.S. 180, according to InciWeb. But fire public information officer Rich Szlauko had some good news, saying that in terms of bringing the Wallow Fire under control, ""Everything is starting to look pretty good."" Some 3,600 people continue to battle the blaze, in the face of winds Sunday measuring 20 mph to 30 mph, he said. But even with marginally improved conditions, authorities across the Southwest and southern Plains enforced expanded evacuations as flames cut off power to communities.

1139,"(CNN) -- At least 150 people drowned when a boat leaving Libya capsized off the Tunisian coast on Wednesday, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday. Scores more were still missing Friday as a rescue operation by Tunisian authorities continued. The overcrowded boat, which set sail Saturday from Tripoli, was headed for Lampedusa, in Italy, carrying about 850 people. The passengers were mostly migrants from West Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh who were fleeing fighting in Libya, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement. The agency, which did not indicate how many people had been rescued, said some survivors reported the boat was manned by people with little or no maritime experience. Soon after the boat left Tripoli, it ran into difficulties and by Tuesday the passengers ran out of food and water. The boat ran aground Wednesday near the Kerkennah Islands, some 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) northwest of Tripoli in the Mediterranean Sea, UNHCR reported. ""Desperate passengers rushed to one side, seeking rescue by the Tunisian coast guard and fishing boats that had approached the vessel,"" and the boat capsized, the agency said in a statement. ""This appears to be one of the worst and the deadliest incidents in the Mediterranean so far this year,"" Adrian Edwards, a UNHCR spokesman in Geneva, said. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter the European Union. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked the dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February. At one point, the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa, which numbers less than 6,000. ""Boats loaded with migrants fleeing the ongoing conflict in Libya have been making the journey to Italy and Malta over recent months, sometimes with tragic consequences. Just last month, hundreds died as a vessel carrying about 600 people broke up shortly after departing Tripoli,"" UNHCR said in its statement.","Thousands of refugees from fighting in Libya have tried to flee to Europe .

1140,"Atlanta (CNN) -- Top officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the air traffic controllers' union kicked off a cross-country tour of air traffic control facilities on Monday, two days after a seventh reported case this year of a controller falling asleep on the job. FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt and Paul Rinaldi, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, are expected to hold a series of meetings about safety and professionalism. Their first stop was at a radar facility in the Atlanta area. ""None of us in this business can tolerate any of this,"" Babbitt said of the sleeping controllers. ""It absolutely has to stop. ... One mistake is one too many."" This ""will not be tolerated,"" he insisted. ""We run the safest system in the world,"" but these incidents have ""cast a cloud."" Inside the life of an air traffic controller . Babbitt described himself as ""infuriated"" after learning about the lapses. ""Any time (there) is less than perfection, we have issues,"" Rinaldi added. ""It's a very big concern,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Monday. ""We will do better."" Federal officials announced a series of new regulations Saturday aimed at preventing air traffic controllers from falling asleep while on duty. Among other things, controllers now must have a minimum of nine hours off between shifts, instead of the current minimum of eight hours. In addition, controllers can no longer be put on an unscheduled midnight shift following a day off. If the shift from eight to nine hours isn't enough, ""then obviously we'll take that into consideration,"" LaHood said. But it's up to the controllers ""to take personal responsibility"" and get adequate rest during their down time, he said. FAA managers will also schedule their own shifts in a way to ensure greater coverage in the early morning and late night hours, the secretary noted over the weekend. On Saturday, the FAA suspended an air traffic controller for sleeping on the job at the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center. According to a preliminary review of air traffic tapes, the controller did not miss any calls from aircraft, and there was no operational impact, the agency said in a statement. The incident was reported to a manager by another controller, the FAA said. There were 12 controllers and two managers on duty at the time. Last week, the head of the FAA Air Traffic Organization, Hank Krakowski, resigned over the uproar caused by the recent spate of incidents. David Grizzle, the FAA's chief counsel, has been named acting chief of the unit. Will NextGen air traffic overhaul make us safer? Aside from Miami, cases of sleeping controllers have been reported in Washington; Knoxville, Tennessee; Seattle and Reno, Nevada. There have been two suspected cases in Lubbock, Texas. All of the incidents occurred during controllers' midnight shifts. Most of the lapses occurred at local control towers. In at least one incident, the FAA has said, the controller deliberately went to sleep, while some of the others appear to have been accidental.

1141,"San Bruno, California (CNN) -- Firefighters have fully contained a massive gas-fueled blaze in California that killed four people, while search efforts and attempts to determine the cause of the fire were still under way on Friday. The fire triggered by a ruptured natural gas transmission line sent giant fireballs shooting 80 feet into the air in a quiet neighborhood of San Bruno, near the San Francisco airport. ""It looks like a moonscape in some areas,"" said San Bruno Fire Chief Dennis Haag, who was visibly shaken at a news conference. Scorched homes and the shells of burned-out cars lined charred streets as firefighters battled hot spots and residents clamored to know the cause of their town's devastation. By Friday afternoon, the fire was reported to be fully contained. iReport: Lone fireman fights flames . California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado said he was shocked by the ""horrible tragedy."" ""It looks like a bomb went off,"" he said. ""I saw debris everywhere. It was a huge explosion."" ""Our hearts go out to those impacted by this horrible disaster,"" said Maldonado. ""Without warning many of these peoples' lives have been changed forever and my deepest prayers go out to everyone."" He said ""we will find out soon"" what caused the fire that erupted after 6 p.m. Thursday after a gas transmission line broke and triggered an explosion. Maldonado also told reporters on Friday he had received a telephone call from President Barack Obama, who offered his support. iReport: Another view of the fire . Four people are known to have died in the fire, the lieutenant governor said. Another 52 people were injured, including three patients who were taken to a hospital with third-degree burns and four firefighters who suffered from smoke inhalation. Rescue workers initially feared the death toll would climb higher as they combed through the smoldering scene with cadaver dogs. But by Friday evening, no one in the area was unaccounted for and local fire officials had not received reports of any missing people, according to Haag. He said about 100 people had evacuated to shelters. Blasts, fireballs and quake-like rumbles . Search efforts were roughly 95 percent complete. The remaining 5 percent was still too hot to enter, the fire chief added. Pacific Gas and Electric Company President Chris Johns said Friday that the ruptured gas transmission line had been secured and no more gas is flowing through it. He said survey teams are walking house to house to ""make sure it is safe"" for residents to return, and he promised that the company will be transparent in working with federal investigators to learn the cause of the blast. The National Transportation and Safety Board launched an investigation Friday. Safety questions raised . ""At this point, it's too early to speculate as to what may have happened,"" NTSB Vice Chairman Christopher Hart told reporters. He said a team of investigators was working on scene to determine probable cause. The group's findings will be put into a report that may not be ready for as many as 18 months, Hart said. PG&E's Johns said he had heard accounts of residents complaining of the smell of gas for the past three weeks and the company was looking into whether any phone calls had come in. ""We are really saddened and sorry about this tragedy and we are going to do everything we can to help the folks who have been affected by this,"" he said. The fire destroyed 37 homes and damaged eight, California Emergency Management Agency Secretary Matthew Bettenhausen told reporters. Those numbers were considerably lower than the estimate of roughly 170 homes that NTSB's Hart said were affected by the blaze. The fire was about 50 percent contained four hours after it began, Haag said. But the intense, persistent flames made it difficult for crews to get close. Gas pipes near homes, windy weather and water supply problems also complicated efforts to combat the flames. iReport: Ground level view of fire . ""The radiant heat from the actual gas and the fireball was making it so that they couldn't even attack the homes that were on fire,"" said news photographer Bryan Carmody, who arrived at the scene shortly after the blaze began. Water pressure in the area was low because the fire compromised a water main, California state Sen. Leland Yee told CNN affiliate KRON, so firefighters had to truck in water. James Ruane, the mayor of San Bruno, said he talked to survivors of the blaze to assure them that the city will help them. He said he could tell how much the incident affected them. ""It was the look on their faces. They were still in shock,"" he said. ""They were walking around but almost in a daze. It must have been horrific when it happened."" Tim Gutierrez, who lives in a neighborhood near where the blast occurred, told CNN affiliate KRON that people living in the area have smelled natural gas for the past three weeks. iReport: Video and photos of the fire . ""Every day after work, I would smell the heavy smell coming from the gutter and sewer,"" he said. Asked about that account Thursday night, Haag told reporters it was ""the first time the fire department's ever had any notice of it."" Maldonado declared a state of emergency in San Mateo County. The fire erupted in a populated area about two miles west of San Francisco International Airport. All flights and operations there were normal Friday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. CNN's Dan Simon, Catherine E. Shoichet, Ninette Sosa, Shawn Nottingham, Anderson Cooper, Karan Olson, Sonya Hamasaki, Deanna Proeller, Greg Morrison, Scott Thompson, Amanda Watts and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Gas fire now fully contained with home hot spots .

1142,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility Thursday for a suicide bombing outside a police station in northwestern Pakistan that left at least 25 people dead, saying it was part of a series of attacks to avenge the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. In a phone call to CNN, Taliban spokesman Ihsan Ullah Ihsan said Pakistani security forces and government officials are killing innocent mujahedeen and ""we will take revenge from them by killing their loved ones, as we did in Thursday's attack."" At least 56 people were injured in the explosion, which happened near local law-enforcement and court buildings, said Abdul Rasheed, the police chief of Hangu district.  The district is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, not far from the border with Afghanistan. The suicide bomber blew himself up in a car, said Masood Khan Afridi, a senior police official in Hangu. Pakistani Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani ""strongly condemned"" the attack, according to a statement from his office. ""The prime minister, while reiterating the government's resolve to fight the terrorist elements until their complete elimination, said that those targeting the innocent people are in fact the enemies of humanity,"" the statement said. ""They... have no regard for the human life or creed as they are following their own nefarious agenda."" Gilani called on the population to unify and ""defeat these anti-state elements,"" the statement said, adding that the prime minister also directed law enforcement to mount a rigorous investigation into the attack. A team of U.S. Navy SEALs raided bin Laden's compound and killed him May 2 in Abbottabad, Pakistan.  Several al Qaeda-affiliated groups have vowed to launch attacks in retaliation.

1143,"(CNN) -- Despite more earthquakes rocking Japan on Tuesday, the devastated country's delayed baseball season was finally able to begin. Sendai-based Rakuten Eagles, unable to use their own stadium due to damage from last month's initial quake, triumphed 6-4 away to Japan Series champions Lotte Marines in a game held during the day to conserve electricity. A quake centered in northeastern Chiba registered before the game, while another of magnitude 6.3 which hit Fukushima and Ibaraki Prefectures caused a short delay in the fourth innings, the Mainichi Times reported. The decisive moment came when Motohiro Shima hit a tie-breaking three-run home run in the seventh innings. ""For me, this game felt as if we were playing our first game in Sendai,"" Eagles pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma said in quotes reported by the newspaper's website as he celebrated his 30th birthday. ""We fought together as a team and were able to pull out victory. The cheers of the fans reached me."" Japan nuclear disaster tops scale . In the opening match of the Central League competition, the Yokohama BayStars beat the Chunichi Dragons 5-4. The president of Japan Professional Baseball Players' Association said the teams hoped to lift morale in a country where 400,000 have been left homeless and more than 27,000 dead or missing. ""We'll fight through the season with the feelings of disaster victims on our minds,"" Hanshin Tigers infielder Takahiro Arai told AFP. ""We will play our hearts out in chasing the ball, that way we can encourage people affected by the disaster."" Japan's top football competition, the J-League, has been suspended until April 23. However, the country's football association is rethinking its decision to pull out of July's Copa America tournament in Argentina, where the ""Samurai Blue"" had initially requested to play as one of two guest teams. ""The Japanese association for its part has not reached a final conclusion,"" JFA vice-president Kozo Tashima told the Jiji Press news agency on Tuesday. ""We will reconsider whether we can send a national team by using our wisdom more than ever."" The JFA has until April 15 to make a final decision. ""We will take part on condition that we call up a certain number of overseas-based players in a way to minimize the impact on the J-League,"" JFA technical director Hiromi Hara told Japanese media, AFP reported.","Japanese baseball season finally gets under way in Chiba, Greater Tokyo .

1144,"(CNN) -- Two days after the largest tornado outbreak since 2008 raked the Southeast, killing at least 45, the focus shifted Monday to cleanup. ""Everybody's been coming together,"" said Doug Western, pastor of Kendale Acres Free Will Baptist Church in Sanford, North Carolina. Along with the adjacent parsonage, the church escaped largely unscathed from the massive tornado Saturday that reduced several surrounding homes to sticks. ""That's the wonderful thing about this. We had people we didn't even know coming by wanting to help,"" said Western, whose church has served as a meal center for many neighbors and a base for delivering food and water to other neighbors by golf cart. At least 97 tornadoes struck between Thursday and Saturday, according to National Weather Service records. Yet more tornadoes will probably be confirmed on top of the 249 reports received during the three-day period, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Twisters hit 12 states: Oklahoma, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Missouri, Illinois, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland. The reports are based on preliminary weather service reports that the agency warns are often revised downward after more complete information becomes available. Of the 45 deaths reported, 22 were in North Carolina, six in Virginia, seven in Arkansas, seven in Alabama, one in Mississippi and two in Oklahoma. In North Carolina, the storms destroyed more than 130 homes and damaged more than 700, according to Gov. Bev Perdue's office. Hardest hit was rural Bertie County, where 11 of North Carolina's 22 deaths were reported. ""It ripped the houses to shreds,"" said David Lafon of the North Carolina Division of Forest Resources, who helped with rescue efforts in Bertie County. The storm destroyed 67 homes and severely damaged at least 15 in Bertie, County Manager Zee Lamb said. ""Starting today, we go into recovery mode,"" Lamb said Monday on CNN's ""American Morning."" In Ammon, North Carolina, 70 miles south of Raleigh, a tornado lifted Milton Powell's home off the ground and spun it around twice, he told CNN affiliate WWAY. ""It was just like a bad ride,"" he said. ""Everything outside came inside, and everything inside went out. I've got two dogs missing. I found one last night and have one missing that I think might be under the trailer."" In Onslow County, Marines pulled a 23-month-old boy alive from the rubble of a destroyed home after the child's mother stood up from the wreckage and said her child was buried, CNN affiliate WCTI reported. ""I started looking for stuff on the ground that was, you know, items for a baby, and I started getting to where I could see a lot of baby stuff, and I found the crib, and when I lifted the wall up, there was the baby right there,"" Sgt. Gregory Shafer was quoted as saying. At Shaw University, where President Irma McClaurin decided to call off the rest of the semester because of damage to the campus, student Julius Stukes Jr. grabbed a video camera and gave a tour of the campus ravaged by a tornado on Saturday. ""All of the offices are done. Oh, my God, this used to be an office; it's not anymore,"" he says during the video provided to CNN affiliate WNCN. ""Our campus is done. The whole campus is done."" Students at the private Baptist college, who have not yet taken final exams, will be graded on work done so far, McClaurin said in a statement. Graduation will continue as planned, McClaurin said. In Sanford, employees at the Lowe's home improvement store are being credited with saving more than 100 lives by shepherding customers into a haven toward the rear of the store as tornadic winds literally nipped at their heels. ""The winds came roaring in within about 10 seconds,"" said Gary Hendricks, who drove to the store with his wife from their nearby home, thinking they would be safe there from the impending storm. ""It roared right through the hallway we were in."" Images of the store show the roof peeled back over the front of the store, revealing rows of display shelves inside. Assistant manager Bobby Gibson said it was like ""ordered chaos"" as employees and customers scurried under cover as debris flew and metal screeched around them. ""It was just people helping people,"" Gibson said of the effort to get people to shelter. ""It was customers; it was employees; it was everybody working together."" Nearby, Terrie Rodriguez told HLN's Vinnie Politan that same twister was heading toward the Golden Corral, where she was working as manager in a restaurant full of patrons. She yelled for them to get into the kitchen, and away from the glass, . ""It took me a few seconds to register what it was in my brain. I said, 'Oh my god -- its a freaking tornado,'"" she recalled. ""It was really terrifying."" Nearby in the same town, John Douglas described how he and a friend hit the floor to shield his 9-year-old daughter when a tornado rolled through the tractor supply store he was in. ""I was just praying to the Lord, please get us out of this alive, take care of us,"" he told HLN's Politan. The deaths in North Carolina are the first from tornadoes since 2008, when two people died. In 1984, 42 people were killed in a tornado outbreak there. In Virginia, Gov. Robert McDonnell toured storm damage and met with people affected by some of the at least five tornadoes that hit the state to discuss the pace of recovery operations. ""It looks as though the resources that have been dispatched are working incredibly well,"" McDonnell said. Later Monday, the governor sent a letter to President Barack Obama, requesting a federal disaster declaration to expedite assistance to all Virginia communities -- including hard-hit Pulaski County -- affected by the storm. The 97 tornadoes confirmed so far makes the outbreak the most active since June 2008, when 136 tornadoes ripped through the Midwest, according to National Weather Service records. In February 2008, a 131-tornado outbreak struck the Southeast and Ohio Valley on Super Tuesday primary voting day, killing 57 people and causing more than $1 billion in damages, according to the National Climatic Data Center. And in April 1974, an outbreak of 148 tornadoes struck in 24 hours, killing 330 people, according to National Weather Service records. That is the most tornadoes in a 24-hour period in U.S. history, Morris said. Although it has been an active month, more severe weather appears to be on the way. A weather system building toward the Midwest is expected to present a moderate risk of tornadoes, high winds and hail in parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky on Tuesday. None of the areas heavily affected by last week's storms is threatened by those forecast for Tuesday, CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said. CNN's Sean Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: : A North Carolina man describes hitting the ground to shield his daughter from a twister .

1145,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Radioactive iodine in seawater around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant dropped sharply even before workers plugged a water leak believed to be from its crippled No. 2 reactor, the plant's owner said Wednesday night. Stopping the flow of highly radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean was a key victory for workers who have struggled to keep the earthquake-damaged plant's reactors from overheating for nearly four weeks. But the Tokyo Electric Power Co. and a top Japanese official warned the fight was far from over. Concentrations of iodine-131 had been as high as 7.5 million times legal standards in water directly behind the plant after the leak was discovered Saturday. They had dropped to less than 4 percent of that amount in the 24 hours before the leak had been cut off Wednesday morning, according to figures released by Tokyo Electric. The level remained 280,000 times higher than the legal limit, but those concentrations were dropping sharply as the water flowed out into the Pacific. Levels of longer-lived cesium-137 were down sharply as well but remained 61,000 times the legal standard, according to Tokyo Electric's water sampling data. Samples from a monitoring point 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) southeast of the plant found iodine-131 levels down to 1.5 times legal levels, with no reading for cesium. Japanese authorities said they believe the leaking water was part of the 8 metric tons (2,100 gallons) per hour being pumped in the No. 2 reactor, one of three that suffered core damage after the massive earthquake that struck northern Japan on March 11. The water has been leaking into the basement of the unit's turbine plant, carrying with it radioactive particles that are the byproduct of nuclear reactors. Until Wednesday, the fluid was pouring into the ocean from a cracked concrete shaft near the turbine plant's water intake. Workers managed to use a silica-based polymer dubbed ""liquid glass"" to seal the breach Wednesday morning, but the Japanese government's top spokesman on the crisis said government and utility officials had other problems. ""Is it completely stopped? Are there any other areas where (radioactive) water is being released?"" said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano, the spokesman. ""We cannot be optimistic, just because we were able to plug this one."" Hidehiko Nishiyama of Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said the now-contained water ""may lead to more leakage somewhere else."" Tokyo Electric began pumping nonflammable nitrogen into the primary containment vessel around reactor No. 1 early Thursday in what it said was a precautionary measure to counteract a possible buildup of hydrogen. ""The possibility of a hydrogen explosion is extremely low,"" the company announced Wednesday night. ""But more hydrogen could eventually develop in the containment vessel."" Hydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheating fuel rods and can cause explosions like the spectacular blasts that blew the roofs off the No 1 and No. 3 reactor buildings in the days after the March 11 earthquake. But Tokyo Electric said it did not believe an explosion was imminent. The radioactive cores of units 1-3 were damaged when the tsunami that followed the earthquake flooded the plant, knocking out power to its coolant systems and disabling backup generators needed to restore electricity. Engineers responded by pumping water into the reactors from outside to stave off a feared meltdown, but they are now struggling with what to do with thousands of tons of now-contaminated liquid. Since Monday night, the plant has been discharging nearly 10,000 tons of less radioactive water into the ocean, largely to make room in a waste treatment reservoir for the supercharged coolant leaking from the No. 2 reactor. ""Right now they have no systems available to them for processing liquid rad waste, and they're generating liquid rad waste at the rate of about 400,000 gallons a day,"" said Michael Friedlander, a former nuclear power plant operator. ""So without any doubt whatsoever, if they don't put in place some systems to handle this, they are going to have to continue dumping the water into the ocean."" Tokyo Electric had released about three-quarters of the water -- which also came from the subdrains below reactors 5 and 6 -- by Wednesday night and had reduced its estimate of how much was being dumped from the treatment facility. But the discharge, which Japanese officials called an emergency measure, drew protests from neighboring South Korea and enraged the country's fishermen. Edano said Wednesday that the move was ""unavoidable"" and would minimize harm to the environment. But he told reporters, ""We should have reported (more information) to the people who may be concerned, especially to the neighboring countries."" ""It was a measure to prevent more serious marine contamination, but we needed to explain the reasoning better,"" he said. Members of Japan's fishery association voiced their ire in a Wednesday morning meeting with Tokyo Electric officials, complaining that they had argued against the measure beforehand and were not told until later that the process would begin. Edano said the Japanese government is considering ""provisional compensation"" to give a more immediate boost to fishermen, ahead of a more final payment plan that may be established in the future. Experts have said the releases likely won't pose any long-term health risks to humans or sea life. It also helps that most of the radiatioactive particles detected are iodine-131, which loses half its radiation every eight days. The emergency discharge equates to about five swimming pools, compared to ""about 300 trillion swimming pools of water"" that fill the Pacific Ocean, said Timothy Jorgensen, chairman of the radiation safety committee at Georgetown University Medical Center. ""So hopefully the churning of the ocean and the currents will quickly disperse this so that it gets to very dilute concentrations relatively quickly."" After a tumultuous first few weeks, utility and government officials have described conditions recently in the plant's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools as generally stable. Levels of airborne radiation nearby and further away, meanwhile, steadily have been declining. Still, the existence of significant amounts of collected radioactive water around the facility suggests that there may be other leaks -- and other problems.

1146,"(CNN) -- New Mexico homeowners who were evacuated more than a week ago will be allowed to return home Tuesday, fire officials said. ""Homeowners will be driven to their homes in government vehicles to stay,"" said Reynaldo Rivera, public information officer for the Los Conchas fire. Thousands of families in Cochiti Mesa were forced from their homes shortly after the massive fire began June 26. On Monday, more than 2,100 firefighters were battling the wildfire that was still threatening hundreds of buildings and ancient sites on Indian lands in northern New Mexico. The Las Conchas fire has scorched more than 123,000 acres and destroyed more than 100 buildings, including 63 homes, according to InciWeb, an online interagency database that keeps track of natural disasters such as fires and floods. The fire was 27 percent contained, the website stated. ""We are not out of the woods yet,"" said Brad Pitassi, an incident management team spokesman. ""This will take a long time to contain."" The fire was threatening a number of ancient American Indian sites. It had burned thousands of acres on the Santa Clara Indian Reservation and had spread onto the Bandelier National Monument, home to ancient Pueblo homes, rock paintings and petroglyphs, fire officials said. Federal agencies also warned that heavy smoke and ash was making air quality unhealthy as far away as Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Taos, and they warned the elderly, children and those with heart or lung problems to stay indoors, according to a news release from federal agencies associated with the firefight. Since starting last week, the Las Conchas fire quickly expanded into the Santa Fe National Forest and Jemez Ranger District. It spread rapidly because of strong winds, high temperatures and dry conditions that have similarly fueled dozens of other fires around the region. Despite continued challenges, firefighters made some significant progress over the weekend. Most notably, Los Alamos County Police Chief Wayne Torpy announced that a majority of roadblocks across the county were being lifted, allowing roughly 10,000 residents to return home. Investigators determined that the fire was sparked after an aspen tree knocked down by strong winds struck a power line and caught fire, said New Mexico State Forester Tony Delfin. The tree then hit the ground and sparked nearby vegetation, he said. The fire has engulfed much of the Santa Fe National Forest, the Valles Caldera National Preserve and Bandelier National Park. It also prompted the closure of Los Alamos National Laboratory. On Saturday, the state of emergency for the lab was lifted, and the lab announced that it will reopen to employees Wednesday. At no time were nuclear or hazardous materials on site threatened, the laboratory said in a statement, adding that it was moving into an ""operational recovery mode."" About 20 archaeologists are also part of the firefighting effort, charged with identifying and helping minimize damage from spreading fires or suppression efforts. At least one is assigned to each bulldozer and road grader, one of a host of measures taken to protect archaeological sites, according to the Incident Management Team. The fire already burned over many such sites in the area, which is known for its Native American history. The Las Conchas fire is just one of dozens still burning in the United States, especially in the Southwest. Several of those are also in New Mexico, including the 100,831-acre Donaldson fire, about 10 miles south of Hondo, and the 10,250-acre Pacheco fire, about nine miles north of Santa Fe. Pitassi said that a combination of ""extremely dry fuels,"" rugged terrain, strong winds and high temperatures have led to a ""record-breaking year"" for wildfires in the United States -- and one that still has no clear end in sight. ""We've had almost a perfect-storm scenario,"" he said. CNN's Antoinette Campbell contributed to this report .","Thousands of residents can return home Tuesday .

1147,"(CNN) -- Federal authorities began closing portions of central Louisiana's Morganza Spillway as the swollen Mississippi River receded Wednesday, reducing the need to divert water down another waterway. The Army Corps of Engineers announced Wednesday that it already had closed three of the 17 open bays at the Morganza Spillway, which was opened May 14 to prevent the Mississippi from flooding New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The Corps said much as 1.2 million gallons (172,000 cubic feet) per second had been pouring through the spillway, which diverted water through the Atchafalaya River basin to the Gulf of Mexico west of New Orleans. The resulting high water has caused some flooding down the Atchafalaya. But the water levels ""continue to be lower than anticipated"" throughout the basin, Corps spokesman Ken Holder said in a statement announcing the decision. The river remained about four feet above flood stage Wednesday night at Bayou Sorrel and about 7 feet over flood stage at Morgan City, on the approaches to the Gulf. But it was more than five feet lower at the town of Krotz Springs and about two feet below flood stage at Butte LaRose, about 20 miles south of the spillway. Rising water levels forced Louisiana authorities to halt boat traffic down a four-mile stretch of the Atchafalaya around the town of Butte LaRose starting Thursday, since the surface of the river had climbed to within seven feet of high-voltage power lines, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries announced.

1148,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Argentinians planning to travel to the northern part of the country, Brazil and Paraguay were lining up for vaccinations Tuesday, because of a yellow fever breakout that has killed at least 21 people in the region. An Argentinian man receives a vaccination in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Public health officials recommend that anyone planning to travel to an affected area get the vaccine -- which is effective for a decade -- 10 days before arriving. Concern in Argentina began last month, when health authorities reported finding 17 dead monkeys in Pinalito Park, in the San Pedro Department of Misiones Province. Tests showed they had died of yellow fever. But the Ministry of Health's Dr. Hugo Fernandez pointed out that the last documented case of yellow fever among people in Argentina was in 1841. ""What we have had until now is death in monkeys from the transmission of the virus,"" he said. ""That put us on alert, and we have put in place all the necessary controls since January of this year.""  Watch residents line up for the vaccines » . The Ministry of Health recommended that residents and travelers to the ""high-alert"" area in northern Argentina, near the borders of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, also receive the vaccine. On Monday, Paraguay's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare confirmed 16 cases, eight of them fatal, in two areas in the center of the country -- San Pedro Department and Central Department. Brazil had tallied 13 deaths, the country's Ministry of Health said. As of Saturday, more than half of the 2 million vaccine doses obtained by Paraguay from the World Health Organization had been administered, the government said. A team from the WHO's Pan American Health Organization has been working in the country since February 15. Some Paraguayans have endured long waits for vaccines in sweltering heat. ""Citizens pay taxes for our health and education, but there are no vaccines here,"" Cynthia Shaerer, told CNN last week. ""We don't need speeches here. We need vaccines."" People contract yellow fever from the bite of an infected mosquito. The disease causes fever, muscle pain, headaches, shivering, nausea and vomiting, the World Health Organization says. Most people improve after three or four days, but some enter a second ""toxic"" phase that causes fever, jaundice and blood in the vomit, the health organization says. About half of the people who enter the second phase of yellow fever die within 10 days. There is no treatment, so medical authorities recommend vaccinations. Yellow fever typically is found in tropical regions of Africa and Latin America. E-mail to a friend .

1149,"(CNN) -- Dozens more workers Monday joined the effort to clean up an oil spill that dumped hundreds of barrels of crude into Montana's Yellowstone River over the weekend, ExxonMobil said. ExxonMobil said between 750 to 1,000 barrels (32,000 to 42,000 gallons) of oil escaped late Friday when a pipeline ruptured beneath the river near Billings. Some of the oil has washed ashore or formed pools of ""milky brown"" residue in river eddies, Yellowstone County Sheriff Mike Linder said. High water and a swift current has helped break up the spill, local officials said. But cleanup efforts have been hampered by flooding that has made it harder to track and clean up the oil, said Linder and Duane Winslow, the county's emergency services director. The Yellowstone was running above flood stage over the weekend, sweeping brush and logs into the river, and had a 5- to 7-mph current Sunday. ""It's too dangerous to do anything on the river, to put out any sort of boats or anything,"" Winslow said. ""So people will be working from the shores rather than out in the middle of the river."" About 80 people were expected Monday to join the 120 working to contain the oil spill, ExxonMobil said in a statement posted late Sunday on its website. Cleanup crews are using absorbent pads to soak up oil, boom to isolate oil that has pooled adjacent to the river and vacuum trucks and tankers to pick up and dispose of the oil, it said. The spill was discovered late Friday night near Laurel, west of Billings and about 100 miles downstream from Yellowstone National Park. The pipeline feeds an ExxonMobil refinery in Billings, and the company said it had shut down the line within minutes. ""We will stay with the cleanup until it is complete, and we sincerely apologize to the people of Montana for any inconvenience the incident is creating,"" Gary Pruessing, the president of ExxonMobil's pipeline subsidiary, said in a statement issued Sunday. There were no reports of wildlife being endangered by the spill, Tim Thennis, who is leading the response for the Montana's Disaster Emergency Services agency, said Sunday. Rescue worker with the International Bird Rescue also were expected to join cleanup efforts Monday, ExxonMobil said. The Montana Audubon Conservation Education Center and Yellowstone Valley Audubon have offered to provide wildlife recovery services and facilities, it said. The spill forced the evacuation of more than 200 nearby residents after it was discovered Friday night, but they were allowed to return Saturday morning. Laurel rancher Lloyd Webber said the spill left a ""pretty heavy"" smell of oil hanging over the area Friday night as he and his wife left their home. ""We went to the Perkins in Billings and drank coffee for two or three hours, then went back,"" said Webber, who lives about a half-mile from the river. ExxonMobil said it had received more than 70 calls to its community claims line. ExxonMobil did not say whether these calls were individual claims or what the claims were being made. The Yellowstone is one of the tributaries of the Missouri River, which it joins in neighboring North Dakota. Thennis said state agencies, the federal Environmental Protection Agency and ExxonMobil are working together to clean up the spill. CNN's Matt Smith, Joe Sutton and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","High water and a swift current has helped break up an oil spill .

1150,"(CNN) -- A man who was taking part in a human cannonball show in Detling, England, was fatally injured Monday when the event failed to go off as planned, Kent police said. The incident occurred in the afternoon during Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show at the Kent County Showground, southeast of London, police said. The British Press Association, citing police, said a safety net failed to engage. A Kent Police spokesman declined to identify the man beyond saying he was in his 20s. Relatives of the man had been informed of the mishap, but his body had not been formally identified, a police spokesman said. A statement on the Scott May website said all shows had been canceled ""until further notice."" The stunt show, which has been touring since 1991, features monster trucks, two-wheel driving, fire stunts and car crashes. David Smith Jr., who holds the Guinness Book of World Records entry for distance shot from a cannon (59.05 meters), said he had not before heard the terminology about a safety net's failure to engage, but said careful planning can make the shots less dangerous. Smith, 33, whose father taught the stunt to his seven children, has been ejected from the barrel of a cannon some 5,000 times. It can be nerve-wracking, the record-holder said, but should not prove disastrous. ""We've never had a cannon not fire or miss a net, and I mean we're talking tens of thousands of cannon shots combined between us all,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. After 14 years of taking his act across around the world, ""I feel that my cannon shots are probably safer than me driving to the next show -- because I control my environment and I control my equipment."" Still, he acknowledged, ""We've had some broken bones and stuff."" He expressed condolences to the family of the man who died.","The incident occurred during Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show .

1151,"Islamabad (CNN) -- A bombing Monday at a restaurant in a Pakistani tribal region near the Afghan border wounded 11 people, including four children, authorities said. The blast occurred in the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan, said Muhammed Khan, a government official. The blast comes as the United States has put increasing pressure on Islamabad to root out terror groups believed to be running training camps in North Waziristan, a mountainous region of northern Pakistan. U.S. officials have long believed terror groups, such as the Haqqani network, are running training camps in the district. The Haqqani is an insurgent group based in North Waziristan that is allied with the Taliban. Last week, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with Pakistan's president to repair the relationship between the two countries following a U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Clinton said Pakistan has a responsibility to prevent insurgents from waging war in Afghanistan from its territory.","A bomb blast wounds at least 11 people in Pakistan's volatile tribal, an official says .

1152,"Birds Point, Missouri (CNN) -- Persistent, heavy rains have helped swell the Mississippi and Ohio rivers to the highest levels ever recorded, said an Army Corps of Engineers official Sunday. This ominous development prompted Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh, president of the Mississippi River Commission, to order several barges into place at 3 p.m. to begin pumping explosive slurry into a levee near where the two rivers meet. This is all in preparation -- if the decision is made -- to blow up the Birds Point-New Madrid levee and potentially flood 130,000 acres of Missouri farmland, in part to save the town of Cairo, Illinois. At 8 p.m., the water levels on the Ohio River outside Cairo had reached 60.27 feet -- well above the flood stage of 40 feet -- according to the National Weather Service. And, boosted by more rain, the forecast calls for a continued rise to as high as 61.5 feet by Tuesday afternoon. ""This is the largest flood that we have ever seen in our lifetimes,"" Walsh said. Two states divided by river, flooding . The U.S. Supreme Court refused Sunday to block any plan to intentionally breach the levee. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito ruled against Missouri -- effectively giving Walsh the authority to execute on the levee-breach plan. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster's office had appealed to the court, questioning the Corps' authority to do so. He had hoped to overturn a federal judge's ruling against Missouri on Friday, saying a 1928 law permits the breach of the levee to ease pressure on the river. Hours before the Supreme Court ruling came down, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon told reporters Sunday that he was not dwelling on the legal battle. Rather, he said that local and state authorities are focused first and foremost on making all necessary preparations, including steps to protect property and lives, assuming that the levee will be breached and massive flooding will occur. ""The litigation is out there, but that's not our focal point, quite frankly,"" Nixon said, flanked by Walsh. ""This doesn't thrill us, where we are, but this is a (difficult) situation. ... We understand the general and his team have difficult decisions to make."" Walsh said he'd directed crews to move the barges across the river to Missouri and load the pipes with the blasting agent. The entire process -- including priming the explosives and breaching the levee -- would take about 20 hours, at which point the controlled blast could occur. ""I have not given the command to put it into operation, just to get it to the next step,"" Walsh said. The crisis is centered on the stretch of the Mississippi River between Memphis and St. Louis, but it relates to a far broader issue of excess water in the river and its tributaries. Engineers have warned that should the rising waters of the Mississippi River overwhelm the entire flood control project, it could deluge cities, destroy crops, destroy businesses and paralyze river transportation. Engineers already have reported sand boils and seepage at a number of levees near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, a condition that Walsh said also threatens the integrity of the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project -- the world's largest flood control project. Belief Blog: Baptism in floodwaters . ""There is water in places where we have never ever seen it before,"" Walsh said. The potential for disaster -- and with the levees deteriorating and more rain falling -- prompted Cairo Mayor Judson Childs to order his city's 2,800 residents to evacuate by midnight Saturday. ""I'm here to try to protect the city of Cairo,"" Childs said. ""I care about them and I don't want them in harm's way. I would much rather issue a mandatory evacuation and nothing happen than not to do it and people lose their life."" Meanwhile, Missouri is likewise preparing for the worst -- specifically, the immersion or other negative effects on what Nixon called ""the most productive part of our continent"" for farming. About 750 National Guard personnel are in the area, with nearly 100 state police also on hand to safeguard the area and residents' property. In addition, 230 residents who were potentially in harm's way in Mississippi and New Madrid counties have been evacuated. ""The point is, if this is going to occur here, we're going to do it safely, we're going to do it an orderly fashion and we're going to do the best we can to defend it and save property where available,"" the governor said. The uncertain scenario threatened to turned the lives of thousands upside down. In Dexter, Missouri, Amanda Jones spent much of her Sunday morning in tears, bouncing from her computer to her phone and back again, pausing only to care for her sick toddler. She and others are concerned about the economic impact on Mississippi County -- and are even more worried about the unforeseen consequences if all doesn't go according to plan and water inundates the nearby Missouri towns of New Madrid, Charleston, Wyatt and East Prairie. Residents are being told a second levee built to protect the towns will hold, but ""they really have no clue what's going to happen,"" Jones said. And even out of the flood plain, she said she's worried an explosion may trigger an earthquake on the New Madrid Fault, which runs through the region. Jones posted on her Facebook page a transcript of a 1988 public meeting in which it was discussed that such a plan could go awry, as the force of the water would be uncontrollable after such a breach and the second levee cannot be guaranteed. ""As we all know too well, plans don't always go according to plan, especially when Old Man River is involved,"" board member Lester Goodin said, according to the transcript. ""It has time after time fooled people who weren't fools, people who merely miscalculated, or failed to take into account its almost infinite variables, or used inadequate models, or out-of-date models, or mistaken assumptions."" In East Prairie, Cassie Sutton isn't waiting around to find out. Her family's bags are packed, she said Sunday. And should word be given that the levee will be blown up, they plan to head to stay with relatives about 45 minutes away. ""They did say the secondary levee will hold, but we've also never been in times like these,"" she said. ""... I'm not willing to be the guinea pig. That's the bottom line."" Sutton said her aunt and uncle have evacuated two homes near the levee, moving out all their possessions, and are now living in a camper. ""They honestly think they'll have nothing to go back to,"" she said, adding the Corps of Engineers has told them the water will cover their home by at least 5 or 6 feet. The levee was breached before, in 1937. But, Jones and Sutton pointed out, the area was heavily forested then, with trees to slow the water before it reached the second levee. That forestation is no longer there, they said. Koster's office said last week that ""the flooding would leave a layer of silt on the farmland that could take as much as a generation to clear, causing significant injury to the quality of the farmland for many years."" Still, even if they don't prefer it, not everyone in the Show-Me State opposes the levee breach if it's truly a last resort. Sutton said her family has traditionally made its living farming, but ""when it comes over people's lives to farmland, I say save the lives."" ""They say it's going to help Cairo, then I'm for it,"" she said. ""But I have a feeling that will destroy Mississippi County, financially bankrupt our county.""

1153,"Phuket, Thailand (CNN) -- When Southeast Asia was rocked by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2004, Susanne Janson was glued to her television in Stockholm, Sweden. Her two daughters -- 14-year-old Eleonor and 12-year-old Josefin -- were vacationing in Thailand at the time with her ex-husband and his new family, and she hadn't heard any news of their whereabouts because phone lines were unreliable. With such a lack of information, it didn't take long for Janson and her partner, Hans Forssell, to hop on a plane. ""I was so sure that when we arrived in Thailand, I would have a (text) message telling me that I could come back home because we missed each other in the air,"" Janson recalls. ""Unfortunately, I didn't have that message."" When Janson and Forssell arrived in Khao Lak, the city her daughters were staying in, they learned that it had been one of Thailand's hardest-hit areas. ""There was nothing left ... everything had disappeared,"" Janson said. Eventually, she had to face a tragic reality: that her daughters had perished along with their father and three other members of his family. ""When I realized I wouldn't bring them back home alive, I wanted to die,"" said Janson, 47. Grief-stricken, and with no interest in returning to her advertising career, Janson was lost. But she frequently remembered the support and grace offered to her by the Thai people in their time of mutual crisis. So when she read that a Thai-Swedish couple she'd met were building an orphanage in Phuket for children who'd lost their families in the tsunami, she decided she wanted to help. ""I felt a connection with the Thai people,"" Janson said. ""They had suffered so much more than I suffered. Here, you had people that lost children, homes, everything, and they were strong. So I think that affected me, and their kindness to me was such that I wanted to give something back."" In March 2005, Janson and Forssell returned to Thailand as volunteers at the orphanage, and in 2006 they made their stay permanent. They sold their Swedish apartment and became the managers of Barnhem Muang Mai, a care home that has helped more than 100 children to date. For the first year, the facility cared for children and families directly affected by the tsunami. But as relatives reconnected after the tragedy, the original beneficiaries moved on and Barnhem's mission evolved. Although Barnhem means ""orphanage"" in Swedish, Janson says Barnhem is no longer an orphanage in the traditional sense. ""It's a home for children and ... families actually in need,"" she said. ""We don't just help children. If we can help a child ... by helping mother or grandmother and keep them together, that's even better than just (helping) the child."" All of the children at Barnhem come from dire poverty, and they've often endured abuse, crime or neglect. While most have no one else to care for them, some do. And whenever possible, Janson works to keep families together. Barnhem currently houses 24 children, one mother and one grandmother, providing daily ongoing care. ""Love is the first thing they need,"" she said. ""Second (is) food ... but then it's school and education."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . Janson and Forssell have learned to speak Thai fairly well, and with the help of their Thai co-manager, nicknamed Wow, they strive to give the children a real home with all of the love, household chores and homework that come with it. ""We want to be as close to a family as possible,"" Janson said. ""Of course, we can't do it all the way, as we are a very big family. ... (But) when something is good, we are happy together. If something bad happens, we cry together. That's the most important if you work with children. Not so much head, but a lot of heart."" Education is also an important part of the Barnhem home, which is funded by charities, foundations and private individual donations. Janson ensures that a teacher visits after school to tutor youngsters who need extra support. ""We can't decide what they should do with their lives,"" she said. ""But by helping them with education, we hope that we can help them have a choice."" In June, Barnhem achieved an important milestone. Fame, a teenage boy who's lived at the home since 2006, started college. After he passed his entrance exam, Janson found a Swedish family to sponsor his studies. She is excited about what it means for his future and that of the other children in her care. ""We hope we can help the other kids understand that they actually can change their lives,"" she said. While Janson has made a new life and family for herself in Thailand, her daughters -- whose remains eventually were found in Khao Lak -- are never far from her mind. ""I think I feel closer to them here than I do in Sweden. I don't know why,"" she said. ""I think of them every day. ... ""My daughters loved their life. And I wanted to show them that I would survive this. And if (I) could help my new children to love their lives, at least one good thing came out of this."" Want to get involved?

1154,"(CNN) -- A small plane went down short of an airport in rural Alabama, killing a couple and five of their children, authorities said. ""It's going to take a long time (to investigate) since the wreckage is so deep in the woods,"" Nick Worrell of the National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday night. The NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration are looking into the deadly crash, which occurred Saturday evening near Demopolis, Alabama. According to preliminary information, the Cessna C421 was flying from St. Louis to Destin, Florida, when it lost its right engine, said the FAA's Kathleen Bergen. The plane was diverted to Demopolis Municipal Airport but crashed about two miles short of the runway, Bergen said. Seven people were on board the plane, according to Bergen. All seven died. Marengo County Coroner Stuart Eatmon told CNN the father was the pilot. The wife and at least five children perished in the crash, he said. The bodies were burned ""beyond recognition,"" he said. Eatmon said it took hours for officials to remove the victims from the plane. The wreckage was discovered around 2 a.m. Sunday, but rescue workers could not remove the bodies for about 12 hours because they had to wait for the plane to cool down.  Officials had to use an infrared camera to locate the bodies, he said. Authorities are waiting to release the names of the victims until family members have been notified.

1156,"(CNN) -- Norwegian marathon runner Grete Waitz, winner of a record nine New York City marathons, has died at the age of 57 following a six-year fight with cancer. Waitz, who had been undergoing treatment for cancer since 2005, died overnight on Tuesday in hospital in Norway's capital Oslo, according to Helle Aanesen, co-founder of Waitz's Active Against Cancer Foundation. She won her first New York title in 1978 setting a world record time of two hours, 32 minutes and 30 seconds. The last of her nine wins -- more than any other athlete, male or female, at the event -- came in 1988, by which time she had also won the London marathon twice (1983 and 1986). Waitz took marathon gold at the inaugural world athletics championships at Helsinki in 1983 and picked up the silver medal at the Los Angeles Olympics the following year. International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) president Lamine Diack described Waitz as ""one of the brightest flames of the modern athletics era,"" AFP reported. ""The dedication, perseverance and fortitude with which Grete carved out her athletics career on the track, across the country and on the road is an example to us all, as is the positive way she tackled the illness that beset her life in recent years,"" he said, AFP reported. Waitz's talents extended to other distances as well. She won the world cross-country title five times and twice broke the 3,000 meter world record -- in 1975 and 1976. In her native Norway she won a total of 33 national championships across a range of distances. Svein Arne Hansen, head of the Norwegian athletics federation called her ""the greatest Norwegian athlete of all times"" and ""a model for women's sport,"" AFP reported.","Marathon great, Grete Waitz dies of cancer aged 57 .

1157,"(CNN) -- The death of a University of Oklahoma football player was caused by multiple drugs in his system -- including five different painkillers -- at the time of death nearly two months ago, according to the state's toxicology report released Tuesday. ""It is with much sadness we look back and see that recently Austin had turned to other methods of managing his pain,"" said the parents of Austin Box, 22. They said they hoped others dealing with pain in a similar manner ""will see this tragic accident as a message and think about the consequences."" ""Our greatest regret is that Austin did not feel he could share his pain with those who loved him,"" his parents said. Box was found unconscious and not breathing in an El Reno, Oklahoma, home May 19, according to a 911 tape released by CNN affiliate KWTV. ""He takes pain pills, and he's not responding to me,"" a voice on the tape told a police dispatcher. Box was pronounced dead later that morning at an Oklahoma City Hospital, according to police who told KWTV. According to the autopsy report, Box had five different painkillers in his system -- oxymorphone, morphine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone and oxycodone -- as well as alprazolam, an anti-anxiety drug. The last few years of Box's life were full of injuries that often required surgeries, his parents said. The most recent injury was a ruptured disc in his back in August 2010. Box was able to return to the field after recovery to help his team. He was considered a big part of Oklahoma's late-season resurgence, according to the coaching staff, and was slated to begin his senior year as the Sooners' starting middle linebacker. Box was ""an integral part in our success the last three years and was looking forward to a big senior year,"" Bob Stoops, the head football coach, said in May. ""As heart-wrenching as this is for us, we know it's even more difficult for his family. More than anything, our thoughts and prayers are with them.""","Medical examiner's report shows player had five different painkillers in his system .

1158,"(CNN) -- A blistering heat wave retreated to the south Wednesday, bringing some relief to the Ohio Valley and northeastern United States. The number of states under heat advisories has diminished to 12 -- half the number earlier in the week. Dangerous heat is expected across parts of northern Texas through Thursday evening, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington and other areas will experience afternoon heat indices of 105 degrees or more through Thursday. Other states still sweltering under heat advisories include Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Many Tennesseans should expect the heat index to be between 110 and 114 degrees for the rest of the week, according to the National Weather Service. ""I just had to stop once in a while and catch a breath, it was just that tough to breathe,"" said Marion, Illinois, resident Ceasar Maragni, who opted to stay inside Tuesday after a swampy Monday evening trip to the Williamson County Fair. Even the frozen lemonade vendor was lagging with few customers in the nearly 100-degree evening heat, he said. Other areas of the country not under heat advisories touted new record highs Tuesday. Newark, New Jersey, broke its previous record of 98, set in 1966, when it hit 99 degrees. JFK Airport and Islip, New York, did the same, reporting 97 and 93 degrees respectively, beating 1993 records of 94 degrees at JFK and 91 in Islip. In central Oklahoma, temperatures in some places shot past the 100 mark for the 14th consecutive day Tuesday. Highs in much of the state are likely to flirt with triple-digits for almost another week, according to the National Weather Service. High demand for water amid the heat wave and problems with soil shrinking as the ground warms has resulted in burst pipes and low water pressure in Oklahoma City. This prompted officials to issue mandatory water-use restrictions for the first time in at least a decade, according to utilities department spokeswoman Debbie Ragan. More than 200 people have suffered from heat-related emergencies in Tulsa and Oklahoma City since June 17, when the agency issued its first heat alert, said Lara O'Leary, spokeswoman for the Emergency Medical Services Authority of Oklahoma. The heat has been so extreme that a portion of the Cimarron Turnpike in Pawnee County, Oklahoma, buckled on Sunday, creating a 2-foot ramp that sent a motorcyclist flying 150 feet through the air. In addition to the discomfort and potential danger, the heat could wreak havoc on crops, especially corn, said Chad Hart, assistant professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State University. The heat wave comes at a sensitive time for corn, he said. ""That's why markets are watching the heat wave. We're entering a period of time when corn pollinates, and so if you get a heat wave in the early- to mid-part of July across Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, it can have a big impact,"" he said. ""The last time we had a big heat wave and drought was in 1988, and that year we saw corn production fall off by over 30% ... so if we think of where we are today with already-high corn prices, a true drought scenario can push prices to highs we've never seen before."" Temperatures will return to nearly normal summertime levels by Wednesday throughout the Northeast, said Chris Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Weather Service. High pressure over the Plains is keeping the weather pattern stable, allowing heat to build. A cooler, dryer weather system is nibbling at the northern edges of the heat wave, threatening to exchange high temperatures for potentially dangerous thunderstorms, according to forecasters. There's not quite so much relief in store for residents of the lower Midwest and South. ""This has been going on all weekend and will continue into this week,"" Vaccaro said. In Oklahoma City, forecasters are calling for nearly another full week of temperatures near or above 100 degrees, threatening to break a 1936 record for 22 consecutive days of such heat. Nighttime will bring little solace. While record- and near-record daytime highs are being set, many areas are also experiencing record warm lows at night. For instance, the low temperature of 83 recorded early Tuesday in North Little Rock, Arkansas, set a new record for the warmest low in July, Vaccaro said. Warm nights are a problem for people without air conditioning, he said. ""If you're exposed to the outside elements, your body can't cool down at night,"" he said. The heat has already claimed at least one victim, a 51-year-old man in Granite City, Illinois, who died Sunday because of the excessive heat, according to the Madison County coroner. Forecasters say people should limit outdoor activity during the hottest portions of the day, wear lightweight clothing, drink plenty of water and be watchful for signs of heat exhaustion, which include heavy sweating, pale and clammy skin, weak pulse, fainting and vomiting.

1159,"(CNN) -- High temperatures in America's Plains States are expected to rival those in Death Valley again Monday, according to the National Weather Service, which predicts a heat wave to roast the county's midsection for yet another day as it spreads to the east. The hottest spots located in Oklahoma through South Dakota should see highs over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and top temps are forecast in the 90's for most of the rest of the county -- with the exception of some mountain and coastal regions. Much of middle America baked in a heat wave Sunday, and the National Weather Service declared excessive heat warnings in at least 14 states, most of those in the upper Midwest. Several daily temperature records were broken -- from Alpena, Michigan, south to Miami, Florida. ""Heat index values"" -- how hot it feels outside -- have been running over 125 degrees Fahrenheit in the worst-hit areas, the National Weather Service said. The scale designed to describe how intense heat feels also includes factors such as humidity. ""This is the hottest it's been for the longest period of time,"" said Emily McNamara from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where the temperatures were expected to hover in the mid-90s through the middle of the week. Extreme heat is forecast to bear down on the eastern United States by the end of this week. Jacob Beitlich, a Des Moines, Iowa-based meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said that two factors contribute to make this current heat wave especially dangerous: the lack of a significant drop in temperatures overnight to allow people's bodies to cool down and relatively high humidity, which makes it feel appreciably hotter than the thermostat may indicate. In Iowa, for instance, he noted that the impact of mid-90s temperatures have been compounded by relatively high dew points in the upper 70s and low 80s. These combine to make the heat index -- a meteorological measure for how it feels outside -- spike so that it feels as hot as 126 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the weather service. ""That takes a toll on your body,"" Beitlich explained. ""When it's more humid, it's more difficult to cool down from sweating.""  Prevent heat-related illnesses . The National Weather Service notes that typically extreme heat is the biggest weather-related killer in the United States, taking about 115 lives each year. That's why it and other government agencies urge people to minimize their time outdoors in periods of extreme heat, drink plenty of fluids, and keep especially close tabs on the elderly and young people. In Missouri scores of cooling centers have been established in libraries, senior centers, schools and other sites around the state to help deal with continuously high temperatures. At Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota Twins supporters stood in long lines to get water from coolers, used spray fans, wrapped wet towels on their head during a Sunday game -- anything to keep cool. ""It is blistering out,"" said one fan, Jeff Ferris. ""Brutal. I've probably lost 10 pounds today -- it's crazy."" While the recent stretch has been particularly difficult, it's all part of what's been a continuously long, hot and in many cases dry summer in numerous locales. The weather service indicates that Oklahoma, for instance, already has had 27 days this year in which the temperature surpassed 100 degrees. Not everyone in the region sweat it out though this weekend. McNamara notes that the Wild West Waterpark, where she is aquatic manager, has had ""record-breaking days in terms of attendance"" in recent days, with several thousand flooding in to get wet and beat the heat. ""It's awesome,"" she said. ""You see people coming out having fun. It makes for a fast day.""

1160,"(CNN) -- A Continental Airlines jetliner flew with one engine powered by a mix of oils from algae and jatropha plants Wednesday in what the plane's manufacturer called an ""outstanding"" test flight. Continental Airlines is the third commercial carrier to test biofuels in their planes. The Boeing 737 burned less fuel in the biofuel-powered engine than a conventionally powered engine, and the two performed identically during the one-hour, 40-minute flight, Boeing spokesman Terrance Scott said. ""There was no hesitation at all,"" Scott said. ""If you had to grade it on a scale of one to 10, it would be an 11."" Wednesday's test, conducted from Continental's hub in Houston, Texas, was the first by a U.S. carrier and the first to use a blend of oils from algae and the jatropha, Scott said. One engine ran on a 50-50 mix of that combination with conventional jet fuel, while the other ran entirely on conventional fuel. The 737 is one of the most common aircraft in service in U.S. markets. A crew of two pilots and an engineer put the jet through a series of exercises, including measuring the biofuel's response to the cold of a 38,000-foot cruising altitude and stopping and restarting the engines in mid-flight, Scott said. Britain's Virgin Atlantic Airways flew a much larger Boeing 747 on a test flight last February using a mix of coconut and babassu oil in one of the plane's four main fuel tanks. And last month, Air New Zealand tested a 747 with one of its engines powered by a blend of conventional jet fuel and jatropha oil. ""What we're starting to see here is even when you combine two of them that haven't been flown before, the performance is equal to or better than traditional jet fuel with no degradation,"" Scott said. He said work on the fuels has been going on for about three years, and biofuel blends could start going into service in three to five years.

1161,"(CNN) -- Heavy swells were expected along Mexico's Pacific coast as Hurricane Dora strengthed into a Category 2 storm Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. Dora was churning in the Pacific Ocean on a path that was moving it parallel to the southwestern Mexican coast, the center said. The hurricane was about 215 miles off the coast of Lazaro Cardenas, the center said. It was moving at 17 mph in a west-northwest direction, which placed it on a route outlining the Mexican coast. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the coastal area from Lazaro Cardenas to Cabo Corrientes, the center said. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 105 mph. Strengthening of the storm was expected in the next 48 hours, and Dora could become a major hurricane by Wednesday night, the center said. The storm was expected to produce strong winds and swells that will be felt on the Mexican coast. ""These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,"" the center said.","Hurricane Dora strengthens into Category 2 storm .

1162,"(CNN) -- San Francisco police are saying  a man they thought was fatally shot by officers actually killed himself. Police earlier said Kenneth Harding was shot by an officer Saturday while trying to run away. But on Thursday, authorities said they found evidence that proved something different. ""We believe that the  fatal wound on Mr. Harding was self-inflicted,"" said police Cmdr.  Mike Biel. Biel revealed the new theory at a news conference Thursday at the city's medical examiner's office. Kenneth Harding died Saturday after a confrontation with undercover  officers who were doing a fare check on passengers on the city's Muni bus transit  system. Police say when he was approached by the officer who wanted to see his ticket, Harding ran and police pursued him. During the chase, a gunbattle started  and Harding was fatally wounded, . Initially, authorities  believed that San Francisco police shot and killed Harding during the  confrontation in the city' Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood. The shooting triggered angry protests by some community members who challenged the police version of  what happened. The medical examiner said new evidence reveals a different story. ""The bullet which was recovered from  his head is not consistent with the service ammunition used by the San Francisco  Police Department,"" Chief Medical Examiner Amy Hart told reporters. She  demonstrated her point with a photo of the bullet removed from Harding's head. It was a .380-caliber and San Francisco Police are armed with .40-caliber ammunition, Hart said. Medical examiner's staff also found a second, unfired cartridge  (.380-caliber) in Harding's right jacket pocket. Harding was also  wounded in the leg by a round  apparently fired by pursuing  officers, authorities said. ""Based upon evidence known at this time including:  officer and witness statements that Harding shot at the police officers, Shot  Spotter data, video tape evidence that depicts a firearm at the scene that was  subsequently taken and the location of gunshot residue on Harding's right hand,  it appears that Mr. Harding's head wound was self-inflicted.  It is unknown if  Harding's injury was intentional or accidental."" When the shooting occurred, a crowd  had gathered challenging officers, police said in a statement released at the news  conference. At one point, a bystander recorded cell phone  video of the situation, including a handgun that was laying on the ground near  Harding. The Police Department believes that  the weapon used by Harding is still outstanding along with a cell phone and  bullet casings removed from the scene. Authorities are offering a $1,000 reward for the return of the .380-caliber firearm picked up  from the scene. Harding was listed as ""a person of  interest"" by Seattle Police who were investigating the shooting death of a  young woman in that city a few weeks ago, CNN affiliate KGO reported.","The fatal shooting occurs in San Francisco .

1163,"(CNN) -- A heat wave blamed for as many as two dozen deaths settled over portions of the East Coast as the National Weather Service issued an extreme heat warning for much of the Mid-Atlantic, saying Friday would be the hottest day in the region. The highest heat index values -- how hot it feels -- could reach 115 degrees in some locations, the weather service said. ""These triple-digit temperatures are forecast to remain in place across the eastern U.S. through Saturday,"" it said. How hot is it where you live? Share your photos, videos and stories . The weather was expected to cool slightly to the mid-90s by Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. The warnings came as the heat wave set 55 record highs and tied 60 more records in portions of the Midwest and the Ohio Valley, forecasters said. Millions were also being warned to avoid strenuous activity and exercise outdoors after the National Weather Service issued a number of code red air quality alerts -- meaning air pollution levels are considered unhealthy for the general population -- in a handful of cities, including Baltimore and Washington. Beat-the-heat advice from a pro . The heat has affected many outdoor activities, prompting one Minneapolis movie theater marquee to read, ""We have AC. Who cares what's playing,"" and one Canadian couple to forgo their original plans while visiting the Twin Cities. Scott Hoffort and his wife, Colleen, of Saskatchewan arrived in Minneapolis on Sunday with their camping gear, planning for a vacation spent mostly outdoors at a campground. Instead they're now doing ""more touristy"" things. ""We went from camping in a tent to staying in hotels so that we could get air conditioning,"" Hoffort said. ""We spent a fair amount of time in the Mall of America yesterday because of the heat."" Heat hurts your insides too . About 100 people, primarily teenagers, were overcome Thursday by the heat at the Vans Warped Tour in Camden, New Jersey, where more than 12,000 people gathered at the outdoor concert, authorities said. ""I just, I guess got overheated and I got really dizzy,"" 17-year-old Maureen Meckly, who attended the concert, told CNN affiliate KYW. ""I had to grab onto her (friends') shoulder to tell her I was passing out."" In Wildwood, New Jersey, tourists and residents beat the heat by heading to the ocean. What a heatstroke feels like . But for some working hot food concession stands at Morey's Piers in Wildwood there was little relief. ""Sometimes it's so hot, I can't even breathe,"" Erik Perez, who works at Curley's Fries, told KYW. In Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Cory Booker announced that facilities were available in every ward to help keep citizens cool. ""It is imperative that our residents drink plenty of fluids, stay indoors in a cool climate, and avoid strenuous activity,"" Booker said in a statement. ""I urge our senior citizens and Newark residents who lack air conditioning to come to one of our cooling centers."" In New York, Con Edison called on customers to stay cool and not waste energy. ""Store owners who leave doors open with the A/C running could be subject to fines from the city,"" ConEd said. The first confirmed heat-related death in Kansas City was declared Thursday, but it stemmed from a death last month. A 57-year-old man was found dead in his home June 5, according to Dan Ferguson, who works for Jackson County. In addition to the man's death, there are 13 other possible heat-related deaths in Missouri: the youngest was a woman in her mid-30s and the oldest were two women in their mid-70s, said Jeff Hershberger, spokesman for the Kansas City Health Department. It may take six weeks to several months for officials to process toxicology tests to determine whether all 13 died of heat-related causes, Hershberger said. In Wisconsin, a 65-year-old man from Fountain Prairie was confirmed by health officials to have died from heat-related causes Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WKOW. Columbia County Medical Examiner Angela Hinze said the man had underlying medical conditions that were made worse when he was helping a family member outside with housework. In Oklahoma, four heat-related deaths have been confirmed since May, said Cherokee Ballard, a spokeswoman for the state medical examiner. Three of those occurred in the past 30 days, including a 3-year-old boy in a car in Norman and a 69-year-old man from Blackwell, she said. An additional eight Oklahoma deaths may be related to the heat, she said, with most occurring in July. CNN affiliate WPXI reported Thursday that a child accidentally locked in a hot car was rescued in Spring Hill, Pennsylvania. The girl's mother locked her keys in the car and immediately called for help, the report said. The girl was not hurt. The high heat is also taking its toll on animals. In South Dakota, 1,500 head of livestock have been lost to the heat, Larry Olsen of the Farm Service Agency told CNN affiliate KSFY. Dozens of cattle died south of Harmony, Minnesota, CNN affiliate KTTC reported. And on a cattle farm just across the border in northern Iowa, an estimated 100 cattle died, the report said. At the Brookfield Zoo just outside Chicago, staff kept water misters in exhibits and gave some animals huge blocks of ice filled with meat and fruit.

1164,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Sixteen people -- including five children -- died when an oil tanker carrying fuel for NATO exploded Saturday morning in Khyber Agency, a district in Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan, a government official said. A remote-controlled bomb caused the explosion, said Shafeer Ullah Khan, a top government official of Khyber Agency. Khan said the bomb was planted under the oil tanker, which exploded when the vehicle was about 8 kilometers (5 miles) east of Afghan border. Khan said when the people in the area gathered to collect oil leaked from the tank, it caught fire and killed the 16 people. A NATO spokesman said the alliance won't be commenting. Khan said in another incident on Friday evening, nine oil tankers carrying fuel for NATO caught fire after a planted bomb was also detonated by a remote control at Torkham, at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. He said the oil tankers were parked at the border waiting their turn to enter in Afghanistan. It was not immediately clear who was behind either attack. In the past year, dozens of oil tankers carrying fuel for NATO forces in Afghanistan have been attacked in Pakistan. Militants in the region have frequently targeted Pakistani security forces and supply trucks headed for Afghanistan in an effort to undermine U.S. and NATO efforts there. At least 29 people have died in such attacks since October. The tankers are often operated by contracted Pakistani firms hired by NATO, using Pakistani equipment and drivers.","NEW: NATO issues no comment on the incident .

1165,"(CNN) -- Three times, Adrian Pracon prepared to die on Utoya island, a Norwegian paradise turned to hell Friday. Friends he laughed with earlier in the day fell one by one in a gunman's hail of fire. He survived to tell a horrifying tale Saturday. When the shooting started Friday afternoon, many of the 600 people at the ruling Labour Party's youth camp ran down a hill and to the water. The shooter came after them, screaming. ""You are all going to die!"" Pracon was one of the last ones remaining between the shooter and the water and didn't have time to take his heavy clothes or boots off. About 100 meters into the chilly water, he realized he would not make it. He would drown with all that weight. ""I felt I couldn't breathe. I already swallowed too much water,"" he said. ""I felt the clothes pulling me down."" He managed to swim back to shore and crouched behind a boulder with others. But the gunman found him. He was so close that Pracon could see down the barrel of his weapon. He was sure to get a direct hit. Pracon thought he was going to die. Another survivor, Otzar Fagerheim, described the gunman as having blond hair and pale skin. He carried three guns, he said. At times, he shot those guns with disarming calm, like he was shooting photographs. He even smiled, Fagerheim said. Pracon was surprised to hear the shooter speaking Norwegian. He was certain a compatriot could never commit such a heinous act. Pracon spoke back. ""Do you want to hurt a fellow Norwegian? Please, no. Don't shoot."" Miraculously, the gunman pointed his weapon away. Instead, he aimed for those who were desperately trying to swim to safety. As though Pracon was too easy a target. As though it was more satisfying to shoot at a group of fleeing people, Pracon thought. He heard his friends begging for help. Some fell limp on Pracon. The gunman went away but returned to find Pracon again, hiding with about 10 others. The madness started again. More rounds of gunfire. He could hear so many of them say: ""Please don't shoot me."" One by one, their voices were silenced. A woman next to him was shot in the leg. Pracon could see her wound was gaping. Pracon clung to the dead. Tried to play dead. It was the only way he knew to survive. He heard footsteps getting closer. He could hear the heavy breathing of the man. Then, ""boom!"" Pracon's world fell silent. His hearing was gone. But he could feel intense pain on the back of his left shoulder. He bore it, lay face down, and kept perfectly still. ""I am sure he intended to hit me in the head,"" Pracon said. The gunman missed by inches. 'I had to get out of there' That afternoon, before the carnage, Stine Renate Haheim spoke to her party's youth about violence against women and children. It's a big issue for the young member of parliament, who began her political career a decade ago in the youth movement. She came to idyllic Utoya island often for such gatherings -- 11 times, to be exact. It was ""the most beautiful adventure of the summer,"" she said. She drew inspiration from Utoya. It was an important place for people from all over Norway to gather to discuss the future of their own nation as well as the problems plaguing other parts of the world. It was a place to get away from the daily grind, the day-to-day debates in parliament, and think big. And most of all, Haheim said, Utoya was a place of fraternity, of peace. ""We love it there,"" she said. Everything changed Friday. It will be remembered from now on as a place where 85 people died, seemingly for no reason. Eskil Pedersen, a youth movement leader, assured everyone that they would be able to speak with counselors about the carnage they witnessed. ""We will not be threatened to silence,"" he said. ""We will continue fighting for what we believe in. This is the best way to honor the memory of those we have now lost. We will go back to Utoya."" But it will be difficult. Haheim will hear the gunfire play over and over again in her head, just like she did Friday. After her speech Friday afternoon, she was informed about the explosion in downtown Oslo. Many of the youth camp attendees huddled for an informational meeting on what was happening to their colleagues in the government buildings. But when the shots rang out, the 600 people at the main building and surrounding camp scattered. Haheim quickly realized she should not be alone and followed others tumbling down the hill. Like Pracon, she hid behind boulders on the beach. When there was a lull in the shooting, she thought it was over. But then it started again. Terrifying minutes that seemed never-ending. She repositioned herself in another spot, away from the gunman's sight. She found herself with a girl, shivering in her underwear, who had shed her clothes in a desperate but failed bid to swim away. Haheim took off her jacket to warm her companion. ""What is your name? Where are you from? Nice to meet you,"" they said to each other. ""It was a conversation about nothing,"" Haheim said. That's how they found calm in that moment of fear. Haheim called her father, a police officer, on her mobile phone. ""The police are on their way,"" he reassured her. She imagined that all the police and ambulances in the area had rushed to Oslo after the bombings. So her father's words gave her relief. Maybe the madness would end soon. Shortly thereafter, she could hear helicopters overhead, and vehicles with sirens in the distance. She was one of the older people at the gathering. She felt a sense of obligation to calm the younger people around her. Some were still in their teens. ""You find some kind of way to get freakishly calm in that situation,"" she said. Finally, she heard someone say: ""The police are here. We are safe."" She hugged the man next to her. But within moments, the shooting began again. They had all been deceived -- the gunman was wearing a police uniform. ""Run, run, run!"" Haheim shouted. The rocks were slippery. She stumbled, fell, picked herself up. She had to keep running. ""The only thing on my mind was that I had to get out of there,"" she said. 'Bloody, bloody mess' When real police officers finally showed up, the survivors were suspect. Were these more gunmen in uniform? ""Everyone started screaming, crying, begging the police to throw away their weapons,"" Pracon said. After about a two-hour ordeal, Pracon and Haheim were rescued -- Haheim without injury and Pracon with a gunshot wound that was closed up at the hospital. Police arrested a man the Norwegian media identified as Anders Behring Breivik, 32, a Norwegian who apparently had taken issue with his homeland's growing multi-culturalism. It was only many hours later, in his hospital bed, that Pracon began realizing the magnitude of the ""bloody, bloody mess."" Recuperating after stitches Saturday, Pracon said fear was setting in anew. Now he would begin to discover the names of the dead. They were friends who would never again share a laugh with him. Police and rescue teams were still combing Utoya island -- 13 boats on the water and a meter-by-meter land search, said Sven Mollekleiv, president of Norwegian Red Cross. ""We have now also mothers and fathers who don't know if their sons or daughters are alive,"" Mollekleiv said. ""They are just waiting."" Doctors cleared Pracon for solid food Saturday afternoon and he sought comfort in a plate of lasagna. ""It was a perfect dinner for me right now,"" he said. A moment of joy, perhaps. But for Pracon, Haheim and other survivors of the slaughter, a long journey of healing lies ahead.","Adrian Pracon survived to tell a grim tale .

1166,"(CNN) -- A clean-cut young man buys tons of fertilizer, which he uses to create a huge bomb. He puts it into a box truck, brings it into the middle of the city, and then sets off a massive, and deadly, blast. That happened in 1995, when Timothy McVeigh unleashed terror in Oklahoma City. And it happened again Friday in Oslo, Norway, when, police say, a 32-year-old man sparked a explosion that killed seven people in the heart of the city center. In Norway, the suspect allegedly and then traveled 20 miles to Utoya island, where he gunned down at least 85 others at a youth camp. Sixteen years and nearly 5,000 miles separate the sites of the bombings. Yet Kari Watkins, executive director of the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, said she has been flooded by calls and e-mails from survivors, victims' relatives and others affected by the attack in that Midwestern city who have been shaken by this week's violence in Scandinavia. ""It's a senseless and needless attack,"" said Watkins, noting that the Norway incident caused ""flashbacks"" for many. ""And it's almost exactly what our people went through."" It has struck close to home in two parts of the world, in part because both McVeigh and the prime suspect in the Norwegian attacks are being painted as ""domestic terrorists."" Scores of innocent civilians, including a number of children, were killed in both locations as attackers went after symbols and institutions -- in McVeigh's case a U.S. federal government building, and in the other a Norwegian government building and a youth camp affiliated with the ruling political party. McVeigh had some help from Terry Nichols, who was convicted and is serving a life sentence for conspiracy and manslaughter for helping build the bomb; and Michael Fortier, convicted for failing to alert authorities. Meanwhile, Acting National Police Chief Sveinung Sponheim said that although only one man had been arrested as of Saturday, Norwegian police have yet to determine definitely that only a single person was responsible for both of the Norwegian attacks. Growing up, McVeigh didn't appear to stand out, working at Burger King and a security guard. With his crew cut, the son of a automobile factory-line worker and homemaker looked the part of an all-American and even joined the military, where he became a decorated Army veteran before leaving the service. Anders Behring Breivik, who Norwegian media have identified as the first and then only person detained in the more recent attack, appears to fit the role of a quintessential Norwegian. Pictures show him with blond hair, blue-green eyes and chiseled features, dressed in a preppy style. He had been a youth and adult member of the conservative Fremskrittspartiet (FrP) or Progress Party, VG newspaper reports, but there has been no indication he'd ever been arrested prior to this week. Yet police say they believe the Norwegian is responsible for the deadliest attack ever on its soil. That was true for McVeigh, too, before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""When it's one of your own, when it's one of our folks doing it to us, it's hard to stomach,"" said Watkins, who joined the memorial effort soon after the 1995 attack. Both Breivik, according to reports, and McVeigh had extreme political agendas. In the American's case, this included a growing disillusionment with the federal government. He viewed its treatment of the Iraqi people as that of a schoolyard bully, then became angered at its role in the disastrous raids at the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, and the cabin of white separatist Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Up through his execution in 2001, McVeigh never expressed remorse for his role in the Oklahoma City bombing that left 168 dead. The suspect in the bombing and mass shooting in Norway conceded the terrorist attacks in that nation were ""horrible,"" but ""in his head (they) were necessary,"" a man who identified himself as the suspect's lawyer told Norwegian broadcaster TV2. Geir Lippestad told TV2 late Saturday that Breivik ""is ready to explain himself"" in a court hearing Monday. The fact the Norwegian suspect doesn't look the part of a terrorist, especially in an age marked by threats and strikes by members of the Islamic fundamentalist group al Qaeda, doesn't surprise Watkins. One thing the Oklahoma City bombing taught her is that ""evil doesn't have to look like a monster."" That is one of many lessons learned by people in and around Oklahoma's capital. Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett said that another is that there's no one, clear path toward emotional recovery from such a traumatic event. ""It's impossible to sum up the emotions of an entire city,"" the mayor said. ""It's so emotional individually."" Cornett said that, in time, the experience made the Oklahoma City ""stronger,"" more united and more patriotic, invigorated by the sense that ""we were not going to let a criminal act tear us apart."" And Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg spoke to this sentiment hours after the attacks, when he vowed, ""You won't destroy our democracy ... No one will bomb us into silence. No one can scare us from being Norway."" The people of Oklahoma City know, more than most, that such resiliency is possible -- but it is also difficult. Watkins said that the city's memorial and museum plans to offer its assistance to the people of Norway, including children's psychiatric counseling and other resources. One lesson that the Midwestern city's residents have learned, the hard way, is that evil exists and it can strike at any time -- at times perpetrated by seemingly the least likely people. ""It seems so simple that we should be able to stop this, but it's so much harder than that,"" Watkins said. CNN's Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.","Bombs in both Oklahoma City and Oslo were made from fertilizer .

1167,"New York (CNN) -- Health advisories were issued for four beaches in New York City Thursday evening as wastewater from a plant continued to discharge into the Hudson River, according to a press release from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. A four-alarm fire at the North River wastewater treatment plant triggered flooding of wastewater into the Hudson River Wednesday morning, after a blaze began in the plant's engine room. The health advisories were issued for South Beach, Midland Beach and Cedar Grove Beach on Staten Island, and Sea Gate in Brooklyn, according to the release. The beaches are not closed but the New York City Department of Health recommends that people not swim or enter the water at those locations. They also recommend that young or elderly people, or anyone who suffers from a medical condition not go near the water at those beaches. The advisories will last through Monday. Popular Coney Island Beach was unaffected by the advisories as of Thursday evening. All employees at the plant were accounted for following the incident with no injuries, New York City Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Cas Holloway told CNN affiliate WPIX. The facility was not operational on Thursday evening but department staff and contractors were inside the facility working to bring the plant online. The plant is responsible for treating 120 million gallons of wastewater a day on Manhattan's west side.","A fire at a wastewater treatment plant triggered a release into the Hudson River .

1168,"(CNN) -- Civic-minded residents of Bismarck and Mandan, North Dakota, found there's nothing like a major flood to make new friends while filling thousands of sandbags. As cities along the Missouri River brace for the onslaught, the ""Sunday Sandbag Thrown-Down"" in Bismarck resulted in 1,600 people producing about 300,000 sandbags in six hours, Burleigh County Commissioner Mark Armstrong said. ""The crisis is just beginning,"" Armstrong said Wednesday. ""There has been a great community spirit."" Over the past few weeks, Armstrong, who has filed several CNN IReport photos and videos of the river and flooding, has been sounding the alarm over the threat to the community. Already, 2,400 residents and 632 homes in the county have been evacuated, he said, adding most of the displaced are staying with family and friends. ""It's going to get worse,"" the official said. ""People who never saw water in their basements are seeing water."" Such flooding hasn't happened here in nearly 60 years, before a system of Missouri River dams in North Dakota and South Dakota were in place. In recent weeks, about 15 miles of emergency levees have been built in the capital area, according to Armstrong. Upstream, at Garrison Dam, a peak release of 150,000 cubic feet of water per second is expected later this month. Heavy rains and snow pack runoff could result in near-record flooding along significants portions of the Missouri River this year, officials have said. Armstrong is concerned that a fast melt of an unusually heavy snow pack in Montana could have devastating consequences. Rainfall of 3 to 5 inches in July and August also could potentially destroy levees, he said. Hundreds of National Guard members are in the area, performing levee patrols and other duties. Across the Upper Midwest, townspeople are remembering the devastating Missouri River flood of 1952, which caused tens of thousands to flee. The 1952 flood saturated parts of downtown Omaha before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the current flood protection system, according to CNN affiliate KMTV. The Missouri River in Omaha was at 30.38 Wednesday, slightly more than its peak during the 1993 flood, said National Weather Service meteorologist Rick Chermok. It is expected to rise to more than 32 feet by Tuesday, he said. Flood stage is 29 feet. By comparison, the river was at a record 40.20 feet on April 18, 1952. It had an astounding water flow of 396,000 cubic feet per second. The Army Corps of Engineers, which controls the dams, said Wednesday that it is committed to the Missouri River flood fight. ""This will be a long, sometimes frustrating and intense effort as the situation evolves and as we work together to avoid loss of life, minimize damages and help communities deal with the situation,"" said Brig. Gen. John McMahon, commander of the Corps' Northwestern Division. ""The Corps is committed to doing its best in close collaboration with city, county, state and federal agencies as well as congressional representatives and others as we address this daunting challenge."" The Missouri River was 1.39 feet above flood stage Wednesday afternoon at Bismarck, with an increase expected later in the week. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Residents fill about 300,000 sandbags in Bismarck area .

1169,"Atlanta (CNN) -- The Rev. Howard Creecy Jr., president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, died early Thursday in Atlanta from what is believed to be a heart attack, spokesman Maynard Eaton said. Creecy died about 12:30 a.m., Eaton said. An autopsy was being performed Thursday. Creecy, 57, was elected president of the SCLC in January after Bernice King, daughter of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., declined the post, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Creecy, pastor of Olivet Church in Fayette County, Georgia, had previously served as the interim president of the SCLC.

1170,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- More than three weeks after seven California men went missing when the fishing vessel Erik sank in Mexico's Sea of Cortez, the families of the missing Americans are expressing anger with the U.S. and Mexican governments for not conducting a dive to find the sunken boat -- and possibly the bodies entombed beneath the sea. The sinking of the 115-foot sport fishing boat during a predawn storm on July 3 captured widespread attention because the 27 passengers were nearly all friends and acquaintances who fished on the Erik as an annual outing, some for as long as 15 years or so. All were from northern California, relatives said. Only five of them were first-timers on a five-night trip aboard the Erik, during which the sportsmen would venture deep into the sea aboard smaller pangas in search of yellowfin tuna and dorado, relatives said. Most of the 27 were Asian-American men from the San Francisco Bay area and nearby, relatives said. Those close ties heightened the depth of the tragedy, especially as U.S. and Mexican authorities spent nine days searching the vast expanse of the Sea of Cortez. In addition to the seven missing men, Leslie Yee, 63, died in the incident. Among the survivors, several were rescued from a Mexican beach. One person was rescued from a coastal island. The families have expressed frustration with the investigation. A State Department official said the U.S. Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board are helping Mexican authorities with the probe. Still, the families say they are disturbed that there was apparently no mayday issued during the sinking of the Erik. Also, the boat apparently didn't carry a satellite tracking device that's often deployed when a boat is in distress, relatives say. In their social media and website campaign to attract public attention to their plight, the families have become so exasperated with the two governments' apparent reluctance to conduct a dive 200 feet beneath the sea that they are trying to raise money to execute a privately funded dive -- if they can raise enough funds on their ""Find Our Fathers"" website and if the Mexican government will allow the dive. The families are haunted by unanswered questions, their representatives say: Did the 16-member crew abandon ship without trying to help the passengers? Did the vessel have enough life preservers? Why did it take 16 hours before a search and rescue was launched? ""We don't want any other families to go through the pain we went through. This should not have happened at all,"" said May Lee of San Ramon, California. Her husband, Don, 62, an assistant parts manager at General Motors in nearby San Leandro, is among the seven missing. ""There's still a little bit of me that's hoping my husband is on some remote little island with some of his buddies,"" Lee told CNN on Tuesday. But the families have become demoralized. On Sunday, they will gather for the first time since the accident; at a hotel in northern California, Lee said. ""Some of them are very depressed, but I'm doing my darnedest to try to bring people together. I'm trying to give them as much hope as possible, to make sure we're hanging on,"" Lee said. In regular conference calls with the State Department as recently as Friday, the families have asked for the U.S. military to conduct a dive. Most recently, they have pressed U.S. officials to ask the governor of Baja California to fund a dive -- or at least to grant permission for the American families to carry out a private dive. The whereabouts of the sunken Erik are unknown, and the boat could be drifting somewhere on the sea bed, said Lee's daughter, Mandi Lee-Han, a 34-year-old preschool teacher. The boat capsized 60 miles south of San Felipe, Mexico, about two miles offshore, during the first night of the trip. A State Department official said the U.S. Department of Defense doesn't have the capability or equipment to do a deepwater dive and search for the fishing boat -- and it would have to pay for a private contract to do so. The official asked not to be identified, saying he wasn't authorized to speak to the media on the matter. The details of the Coast Guard's and NTSB's joining the Mexican investigation into the Erik are being worked out, the official told CNN Tuesday. ""When they were on the call,"" the official said about the families, ""we expressed condolences for the loss of life. Unfortunately, the DOD has limited capability to operate at that depth"" beneath the sea in a dive and search. ""When a U.S. citizen goes missing in a foreign country, the host government takes the lead in search and recovery efforts, often with the help of U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, who have the necessary experience and mandate,"" the official said. ""The Department of State will monitor such efforts and work to ensure that the host government does its utmost to locate the missing person, but lacks the capacity and authority to conduct search and rescue operations."" But the families aren't satisfied. ""It feels as though the Mexican navy is not really sharing with them what is happening,"" Lee-Han told CNN. The six other missing men are Russell Bautista of Penngrove, California; Shawn Chaddock of Petaluma, Calif.; Mark Dorland of Twain Harte, California; Gene Leong of Dublin, California; Brian Wong of Berkeley, California; and Albert Mein, 62, a retired AT&T manager, of Twain Harte. Mein was also Don Lee's brother-in-law, said May Lee, who works in the city hall of Fremont, California, overseeing a first-time homebuyer program and housing ordinances. Families have received messages on their Facebook page that local Mexicans have taken the initiative to search coastal islands for the missing seven Americans, posting reports on which islands they've searched. ""This grassroot effort is someone knows someone knows someone,"" said Lee-Han. She said the families are distressed to learn of what they describe as safety shortcomings aboard the Erik. ""Had we known there were all these problems in Mexico, we wouldn't have sent my father on this trip. We felt blindsided to some degree,"" Lee-Han said. ""What we're really trying to achieve here is to honor my father and all of the men that deserve to come back to their families,"" Lee-Han said. The families want the Erik found -- to see what safety problems the vessel may have had, relatives said. ""We most certainly don't want to harm the economy in Mexico, but at the same time, we want assurance from Mexico that if something is going to happen, that they're going to be responsible for whatever that may be,"" Lee-Han said. ""If there is an investigation that's going to take place, we would hope that the Mexican government would do a thorough investigation, and that would include a dive.""","The Erik, a Mexican sport fishing vessel, capsized in a storm July 3 in the Sea of Cortez .

1171,"(CNN) -- A semi collided with an Amtrak train east of Reno, Nevada, on Friday, killing two people, officials said. The truck crashed into the side of the train at a public railroad crossing, according to Amtrak. Nevada Highway Patrol Trooper Danny Lopez said two people died in the accident: one person on the train and one in the semitrailer. Amtrak said it had reports of multiple injuries but could not immediately confirm that anyone had been killed. Amateur video taken after the crash showed huge plumes of black smoke wafting from the train as a fire burned. Passengers and crew members stood outside. Emergency responders were on the scene, and buses were being sent to pick up stranded passengers, Lopez said. The train carried about 204 passengers and 14 crew members. It was headed to Emeryville, California, from Chicago.","An Amtrak train and a semi crash east of Reno .

1172,"(CNN) -- Team Leopard rider Wouter Weylandt of Belgium has been killed after a horror crash on the third stage of the Giro d'Italia. The 26-year-old crashed on the descent of the Bocco mountain, 25km from the finish of Monday's 173km stage between Reggio Emilia and Rapallo. Weylandt was attended to by medics, who administered cardiac massage following the incident, but he was pronounced dead from his injuries in the air ambulance on his way to hospital. Race officials later claimed the rider's left pedal got stuck in a wall at the side of the road, resulting in him being catapulted off his bike and thrown over 20 meters along the road. Team Leopard manager Brian Nygaard issued a statement on their official website, saying: ""Our teammate and friend Wouter Weylandt passed away after a crash on the third stage of the Giro d'Italia. ""The team is left in a state of shock and sadness and we send all our thoughts and deepest condolences to all the family and friends of Wouter. ""This is a difficult day for cycling and for our team, and we should all seek support and strength in the people close to us."" British sprinter Mark Cavendish, who held the race leader's pink jersey on Monday, wrote on his Twitter page: ""Things like this shouldn't happen. Absolutely sick to the stomach. My thoughts are with his family. RIP Wouter Weylandt."" And cycling legend Lance Armstrong also Tweeted: ""Just back from a run and got the news of Wouter Weylandt's death today in the Giro. I'm shocked and saddened. May he rest in peace."" Weylandt joined the newly-formed Leopard team this season, after spending his career with the Belgian Quick Step squad since turning professional in 2006. He enjoyed some success with Quick Step, notably taking a stage in the 2008 Vuelta Espana and ironically winning the same third stage of the 2010 Giro. Weylandt is the first cyclist to lose his life in a racing crash since Kazakhstan's Andrei Kivilev died of head injuries following an accident in the 2003 Paris-Nice race. In the 1995 Tour de France, Italian Fabio Casartelli, a teammate of Armstrong's at Motorola, was killed after crashing on the descent of the Porte d'Aspet in the Pyrenees.

1173,"Minot, North Dakota (CNN) -- The bloated Souris River has crested at an historic high in Minot, North Dakota, but floodwaters likely will remain at or near their current level for several days, authorities said Sunday. ""At this point, the river has had its crest so far in Minot, but a number of locations downstream still have some high water yet to come,"" said Richard Kinney, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Bismarck. North Dakota. A crest is defined as the high point of the water during a flood before it begins to recede. A boil-water order, issued as a precaution on Saturday, remains in effect. And experts caution that although the water rose quickly -- flooding up to 4,000 homes to some degree -- it will be slow to recede. ""We did have a couple of close calls at the temporary dikes last night,"" Minot Mayor Curt Zimbelman told reporters Sunday. ""Both those areas have been repaired."" He reminded residents not to enter the evacuation zone. The river at Minot crested at 1,561.72 feet above sea level Sunday morning, said Kinney -- below earlier predictions but still almost 4 feet above an 1881 record. Water levels had fallen to 1,561.48 feet by Sunday night, Kinney said. Many residents of Minot, who evacuated ahead of the rising water, approached the water's edge on Sunday, hoping to catch a glimpse of their homes, said CNN's Jim Spellman. Most often, they are disappointed at the devastation they see, he said. Spellman said when he toured the hardest-hit area by boat, several residents gave him their addresses and asked him to check on their homes. Everyone was hoping their home might be the one that was spared, he said, but he had to bring back bad news. ""It's a somber feeling, sitting here,"" said resident Steve Knab. He recalled ""listening to the sirens go off, and they evacuated us, and coming back the next day and seeing this ... it's disheartening."" But, he said, ""we'll get there. We're healthy."" These personal struggles come as local, state and federal authorities rush to minimize the damage to property and maximize security and safety of residents. Three recovery centers will open on Monday -- two in Minot and one in Bismarck, Gov. Jack Dalrymple told reporters. Residents can visit the location to find out about assistance programs and ""meet with someone who is able to answer your questions directly,"" he said. But, he noted, it is not necessary for residents to visit the centers to register for disaster assistance, which can be done by telephone or online. He said he had toured the area, and it was ""sobering, to say the least."" A task force is being set up to immediately begin working on returning children to schools, whether those schools are restored or relocated. Evacuee Robin Taylor said residents have been helping one another. When her family had to evacuate in a hurry, neighbors on both sides pitched in, she said. Jim Sarroll has lived in Minot his entire life. He has sandbagged his home, located just outside the evacuation zone, with the help of neighbors, and said Sunday it is dry for now. He is, however, very concerned about the water. ""I flushed my toilet this morning, and the water was red,"" he said. Still, he said he is able to see the positives when neighbors, relatives and friends bond to get through a disaster the best they can. The Souris flows through the center of Minot, a city of about 36,000. About a third of the city's population is under evacuation orders. About 900 National Guard soldiers and about 100 airmen from Minot Air Force Base are assisting in the Minot area, authorities said. Minot officials told residents Saturday that tap water should be boiled for at least a minute before consuming in order to kill any dangerous organisms. The focal point in Minot continues to be the Broadway Bridge, a critical north-south route through town. Officials have been working round-the-clock to prevent the river from inundating nearby routes, all part of larger efforts aimed at preventing Minot from effectively being split in half by the flooding. ""It's really important that (Broadway) bridge stays open,"" said Cecily Fong, spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. Republican Rep. Rick Berg said he had been in touch with officials in Washington -- which has authorized FEMA to grant assistance -- and expressed optimism that the government will work well with residents to overcome the challenges. ""You're seeing people at the highest levels working together, putting politics behind them,"" said North Dakota's lone congressman. Berg, though, cautioned that the ""marathon"" was far from over. For instance, water levels near the Broadway Bridge were still expected to remain around 1,561 feet through Tuesday -- with a slow drop over the coming week. And the worst is yet to come for other North Dakota cities and towns. In Sawyer, ""we'll be approaching peak levels over next 24 hours,"" meteorologist Patrick Ayd of the National Weather Service in Bismarck said early Sunday morning. Water levels in Velva are expected to peak Monday or Tuesday. The situation prompted the evacuation Saturday of Sawyer's 350 residents as water from the Souris River began to slosh up a main street through town, according to the U.S. Corps of Engineers. Ken and Janelle Herslip's house -- less than a mile from the Souris -- was one of those flooded on Sunday. Even though a crew of more than three dozen friends and family helped them evacuate on Monday -- scouring the house for everything that wasn't attached to the walls -- Ken Herslip said Saturday his wife was still devastated. ""We've had many homes over our life, and she finally got the house of her dreams,"" he said. ""She is absolutely devastated, bawling all the time."" Herslip, who built the house, isn't so busted up. No one was hurt, and they can build again, he said. Still, he said, ""it will never be the same."" CNN's Alexandra Steele, Mike Pearson, Holly Yan, Phil Gast and Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.","NEW: River levels at Minot begin their slow retreat, a NWS forecaster says .

1174,"(CNN) -- A preliminary 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Monday morning off the coast of Papua New Guinea, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake struck around 9:39 a.m. and was centered 131 kilometers (81 miles) east of Wewak, which is on the northern coast of the Pacific nation, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Its depth was reported at 16 kilometers (9 miles). The Japan Meteorological Agency -- which had an identical measure for the quake's strength -- noted on its website that ""there is a very small possibility of a destructive local tsunami"" as a result. It said any tsunami likely would not be over half a meter (20 inches) high. ""However at some coasts, particularly near the epicenter, high tsunamis may arrive (larger) than our estimation,"" the agency said on its website. But within about two hours after the quake struck, the Japanese agency reported there were no such warnings or advisories still in effect. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center did not issue any threats or warning, noting on its website that there was no danger of a tsunami striking Hawaii. Similarly, the Australia tsunami warning center said there was no threat to that nation.","NEW: The Japan Meteorological Agency lifts any tsunami-related warnings or advisories .

1175,"(CNN) -- The medical examiner's office in Concord, New Hampshire, will conduct an autopsy Tuesday on the body of Celina Cass to determine how the 11-year-old girl died. Celina's body was found by divers searching the Connecticut River on Monday -- one week after she was last seen. ""We have brought Celina home, not the way we wanted to bring her home,"" New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said. The girl's father, Adam Laro, said he was heartbroken and grasping for answers after hearing the news. ""I can't see why somebody would want to do that to my daughter,"" he told CNN Tuesday. ""That's the thing that puzzles me."" Young said that the case -- which had been considered a ""missing persons"" case -- is now being investigated as a ""suspicious death."" No one has been arrested or named publicly as a suspect in what is now a criminal investigation. ""Based on what we have seen visually, we are treating it as suspicious,"" she said. Celina's body was found around 10:30 a.m. Monday by divers from the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department near a hydroelectric plant outside West Stewartstown, New Hampshire, according to the attorney general's office. Young described it as a ""routine search because of the proximity to (Celina's) home,"" about one-quarter mile away. The site is also near the Canadian border, where the Connecticut River forms the border between New Hampshire and Vermont. The discovery came a day after Laro -- who was in the hospital when Celina went missing -- said that he was like others ""wondering where my daughter is"" and hoping she was safe. On Tuesday, the father thanked all those authorities and residents who had put their time and effort into finding Celina. ""Celina was a very good girl. She was very kind, considerate. I guess you could say an everyday child that loved ... being in life,"" he said. Laro also spoke to HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" show on Monday night. He said then that his memories of his daughter are ""beautiful, beautiful, just a wonderful-hearted person."" ""I ... can't believe what's gone on,"" Laro said on Monday. ""I have no fingers to point ... I hope there will be some answers, that's what I'm asking."" Celina was last seen in her room, at her computer, around 9 p.m. July 25, according to police. CNN affiliate WMUR reported that her parents told authorities the girl was gone when they went to wake her up. Since then, local, state and federal investigators had searched for her and for clues about her whereabouts ""by air, by land, by water,"" Young said Sunday evening. Young said on Monday that authorities, including FBI agents, had received nearly 500 tips prior to finding the girl's body. She described investigators' focus Monday around Celina's home as ""routine,"" after being asked about yellow crime tape there and the removal of a vehicle. The aim is to ""determine if we have any evidence"" in places around where the girl was last seen alive. Young added that the discovery of the girl's body should help authorities ""hone the investigation, so you will (still) see searches conducted in different areas."" Celina's father said that he had not spoken with his ex-wife, who lived in the house with the girl's stepfather of about a year, since the girl went missing. He described his ex-wife as a ""great mother,"" and added he had positive interaction with the stepfather. ""(It was) a household that supposedly gave her great love, that's what she always told me,"" Laro said Monday. CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","The father of Celina Cass, 11, describes her as a ""very good girl ... kind, considerate""

1176,"(CNN) -- Exceptional drought conditions spread across nearly 12% of the United States last month, a record number that shows the widespread impact of the dry weather conditions, according to a report released Monday. Officials at the National Drought Mitigation Center said the July percentage is the highest recorded level of drought since the monitor began documenting conditions 12 years ago. More than 40% of states faced abnormal dryness or drought, a report released by the center said. The report tracks and ranks weather conditions from ""abnormal dryness"" to ""exceptional drought."" A drought is considered ""exceptional"" when the situation extends beyond what ""could be considered part of normal risk management,"" according to the center's website. Dry weather has been pervasive throughout the South but particularly difficult for Texas, which hoped to find relief in Tropical Storm Don. The storm made landfall Friday between Corpus Christi and Brownsville but quickly fizzled into a tropical depression, disappointing residents looking for a break. ""We were desperately hoping for some rain that didn't come,"" said Tiffany Sunday, a resident of the Corpus Christi area. Texas is suffering from the third-worst drought in the state's history, according to state Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples. More than 2 million acres of Texas farmland have been abandoned due to the exceptional dryness, Staples said last week. He added that the weather has been ""excruciatingly painful"" for producers and affected the harvest of cotton, corn and grain throughout the state. Seven other states are at least 85% abnormally dry. They are New Mexico, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Georgia, Arkansas and Florida. The drought monitor said affected states may see improvement from rain in the coming weeks. ""Whenever there is a lot of moisture in a short period of time, the potential exists for rapid improvement. ... But while that possibility exists, it won't necessarily mean the end of drought in those areas,"" said Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center. CNN's Chelsea Bailey and Gustavo Valdes contributed to this report.","Report: Almost 12% of the United States struggles with ""exceptional drought"" conditions .

1177,"(CNN) -- After an anxious three-month wait, residents of a northwest Alabama town that lost 18 residents and its business core to an EF-5 tornado learned Monday night that their largest employer will rebuild -- and may add jobs. The announcement by VF Corp. elicited joyous responses by Hackleburg, Alabama, residents -- many of whom honked their horns -- and on Facebook pages that had followed the developments. ""It feels like the weight of the world has been lifted off your shoulders,"" said Hackleburg Police Chief Kenny Hallmark. The April 27 tornado leveled the Wrangler jeans distribution center and killed one employee. It also destroyed or damaged 31 of 32 businesses in town, wiping away most of the town government's revenue sources. Nearly 500 homes were damaged or destroyed. The new facility will be larger, more modern and could bring an additional 50 positions to the community -- for a total of approximately 200 employees, VF said in a statement. It also will have the potential to handle additional shipping capacity. The company, based in Greensboro, North Carolina, will break ground in the second quarter of 2012. Target date for completion is mid-year 2013. ""Throughout the evaluation, Hackleburg remained our leading option based on multiple factors, notably a work force who has demonstrated a passion for their work and a commitment to our company,"" CEO Eric Wiseman said. ""We are also grateful to the state of Alabama for the support and assistance it has provided. We are pleased to continue our longstanding relationship with Hackleburg and look forward to a bright future."" Federal, state and local officials had conducted a full-court press, offering a range of incentives to VF Corp., including $300,000 from the town and Marion County, with millions more from the state. Town officials said Monday night Gov. Robert Bentley was crucial to the effort. Since the tornado, the majority of the displaced workers have been employed at company-owned locations in Hackleburg and, about 70 miles away, in Holly Pond, Alabama. The Holly Pond location will close once the new Hackleburg distribution center is open. No jobs will be lost because that facility was brought back on line to provide work to the displaced Hackleburg employees. The Hackleburg distribution center shipped pallets of Wrangler clothing to Walmart, Target and other retailers around the country. One of five Wrangler distribution points in the nation, the center was well-run and efficient, the company said in June while it was evaluating the site and other distribution facilities. But some of the town's nearly 1,500 residents had worried that Wrangler would not rebuild. Hackleburg's mayor had said the return of Wrangler was crucial for the town's recovery. ""The morale boost it's given this town is unbelievable,"" Mayor Pro Tem Barry McCarley said after the announcement. Leaders had worried about possible layoffs, including in the police force, but Monday's development, the return of some businesses and donations -- including from a Native American tribe -- will brighten the economic outlook. Residents are hopeful the approximately 150 people who left town after the tornado will return. The Hackleburg tornado was one of 62 twisters and storms that swept through Alabama on April 27, killing 247 people. Hallmark and Keith Morrow, Hackleburg's only doctor, told CNN Monday night the announcement may eventually draw new employers and convince others that hadn't started rebuilding to do so. Nancy McCarley, who co-owns the Panther Mart convenience store, likened the excitement Monday night of residents in their 50s and 60s to kids on prom night. ""People are smiling,"" she said. ""It's just great, great, great.""","The Wrangler jeans distribution center will rebuild and may add jobs .

1178,"(CNN) -- Susan River is surrounded by fire. At night, flames are visible on the ridges of the Jemez Mountains, which separate River's and other Santa Fe, New Mexico, homes from the situation to the west in Los Alamos. During the day, River can see only smoke in the distance. ""I look out my front door and see the Pacheco fire and I look out my back door and see the Los Alamos fire,"" said River. River doesn't think she's the only one experiencing such a view. ""I think a lot of people in Santa Fe are in that situation right now,"" she said. ""I think it can be quite depressing if you don't stay on top of that emotionally."" The Los Alamos fire, which is officially called the Las Conchas fire, is roughly 20 miles northwest of River's back door and sparked the evacuation of nearly 10,000 people from the town. It has consumed more than 60,000 acres and none of its perimeters are contained, according to InciWeb, an online database that keeps track of natural disasters such as fires and floods. River, an academic affairs employee at Santa Fe University of Art and Design, hosted one of Los Alamos' evacuees Monday night. ""It's very difficult for him,"" she said. ""It's a very uncertain time. This fire is acting so differently (from ones before) -- it does make me a little nervous."" The Las Conchas Fire began on private land Sunday and expanded into the Santa Fe National Forest and Jemez Ranger District, according to InciWeb. The Pacheco Fire continues to burn in the Pecos Wilderness, two miles north of the Santa Fe Ski Basin. It has scorched 10,000 acres since it began June 18. The blaze was 15% contained Tuesday, but it's very likely to continue growing, according to InciWeb. The Donaldson and Game fires south of Hondo and U.S. Highway 70 have merged into one fire that has consumed an estimated 15,000 acres and is also 0% contained, according to the New Mexico Fire Information website. No structures have been burned, however, and no one has been evacuated due to the fire, which was started by lightning, according to the website. Not only have dry conditions and gusty winds threatened the growth of the fires, but residents in Santa Fe and Los Alamos, including River, fear the effect the Las Conchas fire will have on the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a nuclear science center. The lab is about 35 miles northwest of Santa Fe, but still River worries. ""They say there's no real danger,"" she said. ""But you don't know... it's a little nerve-wracking."" Charles McMillan, the laboratory's director, said Tuesday that all was under control at the facility, regardless of a small fire that broke out Monday. ""The only fire we've had at the lab at all is a very small fire yesterday afternoon,"" McMillan said at a news conference Tuesday with other government officials.  ""Our firefighters saw it quickly and put it out.  It burned something less than an acre.  That's where we stand."" The National Nuclear Security Administration was scheduled to survey the lab Tuesday to measure radiation levels, according to a statement on the Los Alamos National Laboratory website. The fire has raised concerns about whether hazardous materials kept there are being adequately guarded.  McMillan and other officials say the materials are secure, and that any information important to the safety of the public would be announced. Doug Tucker, the Los Alamos fire chief, said the Las Conchas fire touches the south border of the lab's 40-square-mile facility, and comes close to the west border.  He made no promises that it would stay away. But McMillan said lab personnel had prepared for such an event. ""They have anticipated the problem of fire, and they've taken precautions,"" Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico told CNN Monday. ""The structures that are central to the operation of the laboratory are well protected."" At Tuesday's news conference, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez promised citizens that she, too, would provide any information that affected public safety regarding the lab and also warned citizens to avoid using fireworks for July Fourth and the rest of the season. The lab has been closed at least until Wednesday due to the fires and employees are instructed to stay away unless absolutely necessary, said InciWeb. Martinez said she's concerned about the situation. ""That is the reason for the evacuation and that is the reason the team has been brought in to make sure that lab is completely safe,"" Martinez said in a phone interview with CNN Tuesday morning. Voluntary evacuations began Sunday evening in Los Alamos and White Rock, a town southeast of Los Alamos, but quickly became mandatory for Los Alamos residents by Tuesday, according to InciWeb. River attributes the success of such evacuations, in part, to past experiences. ""I think everybody learned a lot from the last fire,"" she said. ""I have to say that from what I can see, the evacuation from Los Alamos was very efficient and it seemed to go off without a hitch."" River plans to leave town if necessary and stay with friends who are out of the way of the fires, she says.

1179,"(CNN) -- The Japanese MotoGP will go ahead as planned after a report found that radiation risks from the nearby Fukushima plant damaged in March's earthquake and tsunami were negligible. The October 2 race is to be staged at the Motegi Twin Ring circuit which is 110 miles from the nuclear plant that was badly damaged by the devastating natural disasters that hit the Asian country. Several riders have previously said they would not race at the track but a report published on Tuesday by the International Motorcycling Federation (FIM) found the likely radiation risk was similar to that of Rome or Madrid. It read: ""Based on this report the FIM and Dorna Sports (race organizers) confirm today that, subject to there being no further serious incidents, the Grand Prix of Japan will take place on 2 October as planned. ""As already indicated, ARPA (the agency commissioned to do the report by FIM) has measured levels of radiation from all sources including the air, environment and food. ""The final conclusion is that 'based on the estimate dose it can be said with no doubt that the radiation risk during the race event is negligible.'"" Reigning world champion and current championship leader Jorge Lorenzo said in July that he would not take part in the race and claimed many of his fellow riders felt the same way.","The Japanese MotoGP will go ahead as planned say the sport's governing body .

1180,"(CNN) -- An afternoon at an Oklahoma City water park turned unpleasant for visitors seeking a break from the blazing sun Wednesday. Three women at the Whitewater Bay Water Park in Oklahoma were transported to a hospital after sustaining injuries from debris flung in a sudden summer storm. ""A gust of wind and a quick deluge of rain caused the injuries,"" said Lara O'Leary, a spokeswoman for the city's Emergency Medical Service Authority. ""It happened so abruptly it took the Whitewater Bay swimmers by surprise, but the weather is, in a way, a welcome relief because we were predicted to get up to 113 here."" The injuries sustained were minor and the victims were in good condition as of Wednesday evening. O'Leary said the water park was packed Wednesday with visitors. Paramedics have responded to 269 heat-related emergencies and taken 174 people to area hospitals since a heat advisory was issued on June 17, she said. The heat wave is taking a deadly toll across the nation, particularly on athletes, as two football players and a coach died during summer football practices this week. DonTeria Searcy, a 16-year-old high school student, died Tuesday after he passed out after a morning practice at a Florida football camp, the local sheriff's department said. Another 16-year-old student, Forrest Jones, died Tuesday in a hospital after he passed out during a football practice at an Atlanta-area high school, school administrators said. And on Monday in Texas, Wade McLain, 55, an assistant football coach, collapsed during a morning practice and heat was ruled as a factor in his death, the local medical examiner's office said. The heat wave, now in its second month, is responsible for record-setting electricity use in Texas and dozens of deaths across the U.S. heartland. But this time is especially tough for young football players who don heavy equipment and brave rising temperatures while practicing. ""It is tough and this was an unfortunate incident for us,"" said J.D. Hardin, a spokesman for Georgia's Henry County School District, which oversees Jones' high school.  ""But our coaches have a lot of ways to deal with this. We try to hydrate the players and if they have to move the practices to the morning, I know they will."" On Wednesday, Philadelphia Eagles player Mike Patterson suffered a seizure and collapsed during morning practice, but it was not clear what caused the seizure, the team said. ""Patterson was taken to Lehigh Valley Hospital where he is being tested to see why he experienced the seizure. Patterson has had no complications from the seizure,"" the football team said on its website. The team's head athletic trainer, Rick Burkholder, said ""there is nothing in Patterson's medical history to indicate that he is predisposed to having a seizure,"" according to the team website. After Patterson, a veteran defensive lineman, lost consciousness, other teammates tried to shield him from the sun while medics helped him, the football team said. The temperature was about 80 degrees during the Eagles' morning practice. Temperatures reached a record high in Little Rock, Arkansas, Wednesday, soaring to a scalding 114 degrees. It's the hottest day on record for the city, according to CNN affiliate KLRT-TV.  Officials restricted high school football practices to three hours after four student athletes were hospitalized with dehydration, KLRT-TV said. Meanwhile, Texas set a new record for electricity demand Tuesday afternoon, breaking a mark established a day earlier. ""Due to the high temperatures and high electricity usage expected this week, we are continuing to request that consumers and businesses reduce their electricity use during peak electricity hours ... for the remainder of the week,"" said Kent Saathoff of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the state's power grid. The council is forecasting a third straight day of record demand on Wednesday. Though exact nationwide figures for heat-related deaths were not immediately available, blistering temperatures have been blamed for at least 22 deaths in Texas and Oklahoma, authorities said Wednesday. Heat was a factor in 20 deaths in Maricopa County in Phoenix, authorities said. Some school kids in Oklahoma City were dealing with the rising temperatures as 94 classes were without air conditioning Wednesday, said Tierney Cook-Tinnin, spokeswoman for Oklahoma City Public Schools. The school system changed its schedule this year so that students came earlier, starting on Monday, the spokeswoman said. The children have been moved out of the classrooms that did not have air conditioning and staff was frantically trying to fix the problem, Cook-Tinnin said. ""We've hired outside contractors to help us catch up,"" she said. Wednesday marked the 33rd straight day of 100-plus-degree temperatures in Dallas. CNN's Mia Aquino, Chuck Johnston and Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.","NEW: Three visitors to an Oklahoma water park are injured Wednesday .

1181,"Minot, North Dakota (CNN) -- A spontaneous burst of applause broke out at a Saturday press conference in Minot, North Dakota, when the city's mayor said the Souris River should crest overnight -- about 12 feet higher than flood stage, but several inches short of what had been feared. ""This is great news,"" said Mayor Curt Zimbelman. This prediction from the National Weather Service proved a rare bright spot in what has been, and continues to be, a trying time for citizens in Minot and neighboring communities. The Souris River, which locals call ""The Mouse"" after the French translation of its name, flows through the center of Minot, a city of about 36,000. About a third of the city's population is under evacuation orders, while at least 3,000 homes have been flooded. One resident, Stuart Dull, told CNN about how he, his wife and two children feverishly packed up their belongings ahead of the approaching waters. What they could move out is stashed in a garage, while the family has found a temporary home in a relative's basement. ""Words kind of escape me,"" said Dull, describing his feeling after later sneaking back toward his home and seeing it under water. ""It's a sense of despair ... and it's maybe a check on some of the things that you hold dear."" Stuart Collum said he spotted the silver chimney and black roof of his house, where he has lived since 1968, on Saturday -- with the rest of the dwelling under water. ""I hate to say it, but I had tears in my eyes this morning. It's a sickening feeling because I knew when I come back it won't hardly be worth fixing. It's almost 100 years old,"" he said. These personal struggles come as local, state and federal authorities rush to minimize the damage to property and maximize security and safety of residents. To the latter point, Minot officials announced a ""boil-water order"" Saturday afternoon, telling residents to boil tap water for at least a minute before consuming in order to kill any dangerous organisms. Around 6 p.m. Saturday, following a hot and sunny day, residents got a fresh scare when tornado sirens started blaring as a powerful thunderstorm bore down on Minot. Joshua Scheck, a National Weather Service official, told CNN, ""The city of Minot pulled the sirens out of extreme caution."" The clouds indicated a system that could generate tornadoes, but the intent was even more to alert the scores of National Guard, police and other personnel working to address the flooding to seek cover from the coming storm. ""There was no sign of vertical rotation or tornadoes,"" said Scheck, noting the storm system should pass through the city by 7:30 p.m. The focal point in Minot continues to be the Broadway Bridge, a critical north-south route through town. Officials have been working round-the-clock to prevent the river from inundating nearby routes, all part of larger efforts aimed at preventing Minot by effectively being split in half by the flooding. ""It's really important that (Broadway) bridge stays open,"" said Cecily Fong, spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. On Saturday afternoon, the National Weather Service reported water levels at that bridge stood at 1,561.62 feet with an expected crest around midnight of 1,561.8 feet. This is well above the flood stage of 1,549 feet, but still below the worst forecasts -- and the reason for the outpouring of relief, after Zimbleman's announcement at a press conference. Republican Rep. Rick Berg said he had been in touch with officials in Washington -- which has authorized FEMA to grant assistance -- and expressed optimism that the government will work well with residents to overcome the challenges. ""You're seeing people at the highest levels working together, putting politics behind them,"" said North Dakota's lone congressman. ""And I've seen American flags (that) reminded me how, in the face of challenges, we come together as a country."" Berg, though, cautioned that this was a ""marathon"" that still had a ways to go. For instance, water levels near the Broadway Bridge were still expected to remain around 1,561 feet through Tuesday -- well above the record of 1,558 feet -- with a slow drop over the coming week. And the worst is yet to come in other North Dakota locales. In the small city of Sawyer, for instance, water levels Saturday morning were 5 feet above flood stage and forecast to rise much further, to 30.5 feet, through overnight Sunday. This situation prompted the evacuation Saturday of the city's 350 residents as water from the Souris River began to slosh up a main street through town, according to a U.S. Corps of Engineers official. Water began flowing up First Street on the northwest side of town early Saturday morning, said Shannon Bauer, a public information officer with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The river stood at five feet above flood stage Saturday morning. It is forecast to rise nearly 2 1/2 more feet at Sawyer before cresting on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. Crews are engaged in a ""touch and go"" struggle to build a temporary levee to stop the flow of water through the now-vacant town, according to Bauer. ""We have not given up,"" Bauer said. To the northeast, in Minot, about 15% to 20% of the city was under water as of Friday. Fire Department Battalion Chief John Hocking called the conditions there ""by far the toughest we've ever seen."" Ken and Janelle Herslip own one of those homes. Located less than a mile from the Souris, it's already flooded and more water is expected, Ken Herslip said Saturday. Even though a crew of more than three dozen friends and family helped them evacuate on Monday -- scouring the house of everything that wasn't attached to the walls, Herslip said his wife is still devastated. ""We've had many homes over our life and she finally got the house of her dreams,"" he said. ""She is absolutely devastated, bawling all the time."" Herslip, who built the house, isn't so busted up. No one was hurt, and they can build again, he said. Still, he said, ""it will never be the same."" Dull voiced similar sentiments after the floodwaters forced him and his family out of their home -- leaving them safe, even as they're left largely helpless without flood insurance as the waters roll in. An overwhelming positive from this whole ordeal, he said, is how city residents have rallied to support one another. ""The community that we live in, they're absolutely great,"" said Dull. ""All around, there are people helping people, strangers helping you move, everyone is so helpful. ""I just can't say enough about living in this town ... It's comforting to know that people care for you, even strangers."" CNN's Mike Pearson, Jim Spellman, Alta Spells, Phil Gast and Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.","NEW: Tornado sirens go off in Minot, but there's no sign of any twisters .

1182,"(CNN) -- More Arizona and New Mexico residents Wednesday returned to their homes, in some cases to find them intact, in other cases to sift through debris left by a massive wildfire. The Wallow fire in east central Arizona is one of 58 large wildfires burning in the United States, from Alaska to Florida, according to the National Interagency Coordination Center. All told, the fires have burned 2,166 square miles or 1.4 million acres -- nearly the size of Delaware. The largest of the fires continues to be Arizona's Wallow fire, which has burned 529,825 acres so far, the fire's incident command team announced Wednesday. Officials said it is about 58% contained. While residents in Greer, Arizona, and Luna, New Mexico, have been allowed home, evacuation orders remain in effect in other locations. Residents in parts of Apache County, Arizona, also have been told to be prepared to evacuate should. CNN iReporter Andrew Pielage, a hotel manager in suburban Phoenix, took photos of burned homes in Greer. ""As a photographer, I'm here to document what's happening,"" Pielage said. ""Just because the flames are out doesn't mean the fire is done with. I really feel for the people of Greer and their loss."" Pielage said he was impressed by the perseverance of firefighters and those who live in the community. ""The photos document both the relentless work the firefighters did to save the homes of Greer as well as, tragically, the ones they could not,"" he said. Greer residents were ordered to evacuate on June 6, two days before the Wallow fire blew through their town of about 200 inhabitants and scorched at least 22 homes and 24 outbuildings. They were allowed home beginning Monday. A voluntary evacuation order was issued Wednesday for Pender County, North Carolina, residents affected by a fire. More than 18,000 acres have burned in the Holly Shelter Game Land area northeast of Wilmington, officials said. No homes had been damaged. In Texas, a fast-moving fire near Grimes County destroyed at least 26 homes as it burned across more than 4,000 acres. The fire was caused by homeowners grilling near Stoneham, Texas, CNN affiliate KHOU-TV reported. Grimes County Sheriff Don Sowell said officials have identified a person of interest who is believed to have built the barbecue pit that started the fire, but authorities do not believe there was any intent of arson. The speed of the fire forced evacuations of whole subdivisions throughout the area. Jerome Seeberger, who owns 40 acres in Grimes County, said there is just one word to describe the scene. ""Apocalypse,"" he told KHOU as he stood in front of a backdrop of charred trees. ""I've never seen anything like this. Such a beautiful forest two days ago and now look at it."" The number of wildfires so far this year is below the 10-year average for the United States, according to the U.S. Forest Service. But the number of acres burned is three times that 10-year average, according to the agency. While some state and local authorities have reported stretched resources from the widespread fires, Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell told Congress last week that there's plenty of capacity to continue fighting fires. The U.S. Forest Service and the Department of the Interior have about 16,000 trained firefighters available nationwide, Tidwell said. The agency also has left-over funds from previous years to pay higher-than-usual firefighting costs. Two Florida Division of Forestry firefighters died Monday while fighting a wildfire in north-central Florida that had been declared contained but suddenly burst out of control, Amanda Bevis, a division spokeswoman, said Tuesday. CNN's Craig Bell contributed to this report.","More than 10,000 firefighters battle wildfires in 12 states .

1183,"(CNN) -- Engine trouble during takeoff forced a Delta plane headed to the Bahamas to return to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Thursday morning. Passenger Angela Havely said flames emerged from the left engine on takeoff. ""There was a lot of smoke,"" she said, adding that she feared for her life.

1184,"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The number of deaths in Sudan's Darfur region since 2006 may have been underestimated by as much as 50 percent, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs said Tuesday. An man injured in clashes with tribal fighters outside the African Union Mission in southern Darfur in 2007. In March, international figures, including U.N. data, put the death toll in Darfur at 200,000, with another 2.5 million people displaced. But 300,000 are believed to have died in the tribal conflict in the past two years, said John Holmes, who also is the United Nations emergency relief coordinator. Holmes said that sexual violence has increased and that food allotments for civilians affected by the civil war will be halved in a few days. Holmes gave the U.N. Security Council an update on conditions in the western Sudan region, revisiting a report he gave a year ago. ""I am sad to say that the humanitarian situation remains as grim today as it was then, if not more so,"" he said. In 2008, 100,000 civilians have fled their homes, many not for the first time. The Darfur conflict began five years ago, when ethnic African tribesmen took up arms, complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by the Sudanese government. Sudan's Arab-dominated government is accused of responding by unleashing tribal militias known as Janjaweed, which are said to have committed the worst atrocities against Darfur's local communities. There also have been intra-rebel and tribal clashes, Holmes added. He blamed the military arm of the Justice and Equality Movement faction of the Sudan Liberation Movement for the most recent round of violence, and he accused the government of using ""disproportionate force"" and failing to differentiate between civilians and rebels in their response. ""Darfur today is still characterized by insecurity, lawlessness and impunity,"" he said. ""A particularly worrying feature is evidence of high levels of sexual violence and exploitation in the northern corridor of west Darfur over the past two months."" This is shown by the increased number of women and girls seeking treatment after sexual brutality, Holmes said. The World Food Programme announced last week that it will have to cut back its food distributions in May, partly because of attacks on convoys that reduced the amount of supplies they can get through, Holmes said. Six aid workers have been killed this year, and 42 humanitarian posts have been attacked. The supply line also is hurt by soaring food prices: The price of staples such as millet has doubled since April 2007, Holmes said. While expressing gratitude to the Sudanese government for improved cooperation under various agreements, Holmes said there still is no physical access to internally displaced persons and some other groups. He said he was ""saddened and angry"" that after five years, there has been no lasting solution to the suffering. He made several recommendations to the government, including disbanding the Janjaweed, providing security for citizens, ending impunity for criminals and shouldering more of the financial burden for humanitarian aid. Holmes also said rebels must stop their attacks against people and humanitarian convoys. E-mail to a friend .","In March, death toll in Darfur given as 200,000; 2.5 million people displaced .

1185,"(CNN) -- A powerful storm system that ripped through the Louisville, Kentucky, area left thousands of people without power and forced the closing of the internationally famous Churchill Downs racetrack on Thursday. The National Weather Service said damage from the Wednesday night system, which also struck the University of Louisville campus, likely resulted from tornadoes. However, Weather Service meteorologist Ryan Sharp said that cannot be confirmed until a storm survey is completed later Thursday. A storm survey confirmed that an F-1 tornado touched down in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, east of Louisville, according to the National Weather Service.  The tornado uprooted trees and blew debris across short distances, but no injuries or fatalities occurred, according to the survey. A separate survey was still on-going in the Churchill Downs area, said the Weather Service. The storms also spawned flash floods that left two motorists stranded in their cars amid the rising waters, according to CNN-affiliate WAVE.  They were rescued by firefighters, the Louisville television station reported. About 8,500 customers lost electricity, according to Louisville-Jefferson County emergency officials. In a statement early Thursday, Churchill Downs announced that the horse track would be closed all day for racing and training because of damage left behind by the storm. However, the track's training facility, Trackside Louisville, was not damaged and will remain open, the statement read. Churchill Downs also said it had contacted the Red Cross about finding temporary shelter for 100 stable-area workers whose living quarters ""were damaged or compromised by the strong winds."" Churchill Downs is home to the Kentucky Derby. ""Nine barns suffered significant damage as a result of the storm, which reportedly produced tornadoes in the metro Louisville area,"" the statement read. Churchill Downs spokesman Darren Rogers said no one was injured, including any of the 1,400 horses stabled at the facility. However, track officials early Thursday were preparing to relocate as many as 150 horses. Rogers said the horses may need to be moved because of the possibility that the storm had left nails on the ground, which could injure the animals. Buddy Rogers, a spokesman for the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management said his agency had not received reports of injuries at the racetrack or elsewhere. CNN's Ben Smith contributed to this report.","Churchill Downs racetrack is closed because of storm damage .

1186,"(CNN) -- The W Austin hotel is closing indefinitely after glass fell from the balcony panels of the Austin, Texas, building for a second day in a row and the third time in recent weeks, the hotel's parent company announced Tuesday. The hotel will be closed ""until further notice"" as the glass panels are replaced, the hotel's parent company said in a statement Tuesday. Guests of the hotel are being relocated to other hotels. ""We are replacing every piece of balcony glass on the building,"" Stratus Properties CEO Beau Armstrong said in the statement. The incident occurred the same day a lawsuit was filed against the hotel on behalf of two people who were injured June 10 when glass from a broken panel rained down on them in the hotel pool, CNN affiliate KXAN-TV reported. According to the lawsuit, the hotel had been warned of the problem before the incident but failed to respond, KXAN reported. Just after 5 p.m. Tuesday, three panels fell from the south side of the building, a day after panels fell on cars parked below on 3rd Street, KXAN reported. The W Hotel in midtown Atlanta was the site of a fatal accident on May 28, when two women crashed through a 10-floor window and one fell to her death. According to a preliminary investigation, the friends were ""play fighting"" when they smashed into the window and fell. In the days following that incident, an Atlanta police spokesman said in a statement officers were not looking at the glass in the windows as a factor and had ""no reason to believe this was anything other than a tragic accident."" In a statement Tuesday, W Austin stressed that the Austin and Atlanta incidents were ""completely unrelated."" ""They involve two dissimilar types of buildings that were built at different times,"" the statement said. ""The incident at the W Austin involved balcony glass on empty condos above the hotel and the incident at the W Atlanta Midtown involved a guestroom window.""","Falling-glass incident is the third in recent weeks involving the Austin, Texas, hotel .

1187,"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- At least seven Somali civilians were killed Friday morning when people trying to take food clashed with government troops at the Badbaado refugee camp in Mogadishu, a witness told CNN. Mahamed Ali, a refugee at the camp, said several other people were wounded in the incident, which was sparked when food supplies were taken. David Orr, a spokesman for the World Food Programme in east, central and southern Africa, said the organization was working to clarify what happened. ""This incident highlights the challenges that humanitarian agencies face in trying to deliver assistance in this difficult environment,"" he told CNN. The incident came a day after the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was ratcheting up emergency operations to help an additional 1.1 million people suffering from famine under drought and conflict. The agency is asking donors for $87 million more to address the crisis. ""The move comes in response to a situation that is becoming ever more desperate,"" said Jakob Kellenberger, the president of the agency. ""Hundreds of thousands of Somalis face life-threatening food and water shortages."" The African Union, however, postponed its donor conference by two weeks, without giving any reasons. The meeting planned for August 9 now will take place August 25. The United Nations estimates that 29,000 children have perished in the past month. Valerie Amos, the under-secretary for general and emergency relief, told CNN Thursday that 600,000 may die. She urged support for the aid organizations that are able to operate in southern Somalia, in areas controlled by rebel Al-Shabaab militants, who have banned international agencies. Al-Shabaab launched a Ramadan offensive Monday amid the spreading famine, with heavy fighting reported in northeastern Mogadishu, according to African Union officials. The United Nations declared famine in three more regions of Somalia on Wednesday -- the war-ravaged capital, Mogadishu, as well as the Ifgooye corridor and the Shabelle regions west of Mogadishu. The human catastrophe was triggered by the worst drought in more than a half-century and compounded by decades of conflict, high inflation and increasing global food and fuel prices. The United Nations issued a famine declaration for two districts of southern Somalia in June. In all, about 12 million people in the Horn of Africa region need assistance. Somalia is the worst hit.","Several others were wounded, the witness says .

1188,"(CNN) -- The Las Conchas fire in New Mexico swelled to 92,735 acres burned Thursday, and strong winds threatened to be firefighters' greatest challenge moving in to the fifth day battling the flames. ""We have seen fire behavior we have never seen before,"" Fire Chief Doug Tucker told reporters Thursday. Tucker said no fire was coming from the south and that Thursday the fire would keep moving north towards Santa Clara. Officials also dispelled rumors that residents, who were worried about their homes, could return to Los Alamos. ""Folks right now are hurting us,"" said Police Chief Wayne Torpy Thursday.  ""Los Alamos County called the evacuation and Los Alamos County will be the one that repeals the evacuation ... You're going to erase the success of our evacuations."" Torpy also said that residents' homes had not been impacted by the fire. However, the nearby flames will keep the Los Alamos National Laboratory closed through at least Friday, a statement on the lab's website said. ""What I witnessed today was an incredibly professional job by men and women who are risking their lives to save our community and this laboratory,"" Charles McMillan, the lab director, said Wednesday.  ""I could feel the heat of the fire on my face as I watched from the roof of our Emergency Operations Center."" The Los Alamos fire, which is officially called the Las Conchas fire, has forced nearly 10,000 people from their homes in the town. Jerome MacDonald, operations section chief for the multi-state southwest area Incident management team, said fire officials flanked the fire on the east side Thursday in an attempt to curb high winds from the southwest. Concerns were raised that the wildfire could put the Los Alamos lab at risk, as well as waste or other toxic materials stored at the site. But Tucker said that the waste is stored in drums that are kept on a blacktop with no vegetation around and are safe from fire. If the fire should get too close to the drums, firefighters were ready to use foam to ensure that nothing would be released into the environment, he said. The Las Conchas Fire began on private land Sunday and expanded into the Santa Fe National Forest and Jemez Ranger District, according to InciWeb, an online database that keeps track of natural disasters such as fires and floods. The fire was 3% contained Thursday. In a news statement released Wednesday, the Santa Fe National Forest and Valles Caldera National Preserve said that parts of both preserves would close to the public until the fire is more controlled. Parts of the national forest have been placed under ""stage III"" fire restrictions, meaning all areas are off-limits for use unless otherwise posted. The Las Conchas Fire touches the south border of the lab's 40-square-mile facility, and comes close to the west border, according to Tucker. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez warned citizens to avoid using fireworks on the July Fourth holiday and the rest of the season. The Las Conchas Fire is one of several burning in the region. The Donaldson and Game Fires south of the town of Hondo and U.S. Highway 70 have merged into one fire that has consumed an estimated 43,290 acres and is 0% contained, according to the New Mexico Fire Information website. Evacuations were ordered for Alamo Canyon Wednesday as the Donaldson fire continues to threaten parts of Lincoln County. The Pacheco Fire continues to burn in the Pecos Wilderness, two miles north of the Santa Fe Ski Basin. It has scorched 10,000 acres since it began June 18. The blaze was 24% contained Thursday, with the potential for growth considered low, according to InciWeb.

1189,"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The sinking of a duck boat that killed two people was ""another tragic example of the deadliness of distraction"" the chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday after a final report showed several people involved were on the cell phones or computers. The National Transportation Safety Board released its final report Tuesday for the duck boat crash last July in Philadelphia. The collision killed two Hungarian tourists, Dora Schwendtner, 16, and Szabolcs Prem, 20, and plunged the amphibious vessel and its 35 passengers plus two crew members underwater. The five-member safety board met to discuss the findings, probable cause and safety recommendations from the final report presented to the board by NTSB investigators. The fatal collision between the duck boat and a barge on the Delaware River was ""another tragic example of the deadliness of distraction,"" said Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the NTSB. 2010: Tour boat calls before crash went unanswered . According to NTSB findings, tugboat pilot, Matt Devlin, made and received 21 cell phone calls in addition to surfing the Web using a company laptop during his more than two hours at the wheel. After the accident, Devlin initially told his superiors and the Coast Guard that he was dealing with a serious family medical emergency involving his 6-year-old son. Devlin refused to talk to investigators after those initial interviews. The tug pilot was on an outbound personal cell phone call that lasted five to six minutes; investigators said at the time the duck boat operator was calling for help. The deckhand on the disabled duck boat also was texting, and he sent several messages after dropping anchor, including one a minute before the barge hit. The accident is not about the actions of one person, instead it is shedding light on a new and highly troubling societal norm, Hersman said. ""This is going to reach epidemic proportions,"" she said. ""It is well past time to pay attention."" Devlin was in the tug's lower wheelhouse, not the upper wheelhouse as originally thought, leaving the stalled, 33-foot duck boat in his blind spot, investigators said. The sightseeing duck boat was anchored in the shipping channel after being shut down because the boat's operator saw smoke and feared an on-board fire. One of the final communications before the crash was from the operator of a passenger ferry moments before the two vessels collided: ""Hey northbound barge. Northbound barge at Penn's Landing. That duck boat is broken down."" Ride the Ducks initially suspended its Philadelphia operation following the crash. Operations resumed in April with new safety procedures. In addition to the two passengers who drowned, 10 other passengers suffered minor injuries, according to an NTSB report released several months after the incident.","The final NTSB report shows several people involved were on cell phones or computers .

1190,"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Arlene appeared to be losing steam as it lumbered across Mexico Thursday, but authorities said the possibility of torrential rains and flooding still threatened many parts of the country. Arlene, the first named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, was moving west-southwest at about 7 mph, packing sustained winds of 40 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. It was expected to diminish into a tropical depression later Thursday. Forecasters from the center warned of possible flash floods and mudslides. In Tamaulipas, rains began early Thursday, and precautions were being taken in the southern part of the state, which is expected to be among the hardest hit, said Adan Moctezuma, spokesman for the state government. An alert had been issued in the region, telling residents to prepare for evacuations if necessary. Mexican authorities issued a hurricane warning as Arlene advanced, but that warning had been lifted by Thursday afternoon. A tropical storm warning remained in effect from Tampico, Mexico, south to Barra de Nautla, Mexico. The storm is expected to produce 4 to 8 inches of rain in some areas, while isolated amounts of up to 15 inches could fall in mountainous terrain and could cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides. The Atlantic hurricane season spans June 1 to November 30.

1191,"Tokyo (CNN) -- A safety panel convenes in Japan Tuesday to examine whether two vaccines widely used around the world contributed to the deaths of five children in the past month. Japan's health ministry ordered doctors to stop immunizing infants with the vaccines while authorities investigate Pfizer's Prevenar vaccine and Sanofi Pasteur's ActHIB vaccine -- commonly given to infants in the United States and other developed nations. The health ministry said it suspended the vaccines because the children all died within a short period of time; four died last week and one died in February. Three of the infants had underlying medical conditions, the health ministry said. Authorities are investigating the medical history of one of the children, and the fifth child had no apparent illness at the time of vaccination, according to the ministry. Both companies maintain that their vaccines -- which are aimed at stopping bacteria that can cause meningitis, pneumonia and other serious infections -- are safe. ""Pfizer thoroughly reviews and continually monitors all of its medicines and vaccines, as safety is our top priority,"" Pfizer said in a statement. ""No causal relationship has been established between the events reported in Japan and vaccination to date. We are conducting a thorough evaluation of these cases in cooperation with the relevant regulatory health authorities."" Sanofi Pasteur said that the company expresses condolences to the families who had lost children, but also said that no causal relationship between the deaths and the ActHIB vaccine had been established. ""We have been and will be providing all data of ActHIB and will fully collaborate with the ministry of health and welfare,"" the company said. Prevenar prevents illnesses caused by pneumococcal bacteria and ActHIB prevents infection with the Haemophilius influenza. Pediatrician Michiko Suwa said Japan's medical community hopes the suspension is temporary and fears the government is overreacting to the deaths. ""I'm concerned that this will impact the future of these critical vaccines,"" she said, noting that she has been receiving concerned calls from parents since the government announced the suspension. The World Health Organization has backed the inclusion of Prevenar in national childhood immunization programs, especially in developing nations where infant mortality remains high. Pfizer estimates it has distributed more than 360 million doses of the vaccine, which is available in more than 100 countries around the world and part of the routine childhood immunization schedule in more than 50 countries. In Japan, 2 million doses have been administered. The U.S. Food and Drug administration said it was aware of the suspensions in Japan, but ""physicians assessing vaccine safety at the FDA and CDC have not detected new safety concerns"" related to the vaccines.","Pfizer's Prevenar and Sanofi Pasteur's ActHIB are suspended in Japan .

1192,"(CNN) -- Most of those killed on the helicopter that crashed in eastern Afghanistan overnight were a part of the fighting force known as the Navy SEALs, two U.S. government officials said. The men who died were not the ones who killed Osama bin Laden in May, but they belonged to the same unit, a military official said. The group has its origins in World War II, when the United States realized that to invade Japan, it needed savvy, quick-thinking fighters who could perform reconnaissance at sea. Beyond tactical expertise, the SEALs -- short for Sea, Air and Land teams -- needed to have extraordinary physical strength. According to the SEAL web site, they became known as jack-of-all-trade troops, able to survey China's Yangtze River disguised as Chinese nationals in 1945 or conduct demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the Korean coast during the Korean War. It was the SEALs who were sent to kill bin Laden in Pakistan, ending a decade-long manhunt. The SEALs did not get their name until after President Kennedy spoke about his admiration for special forces troops and his hope that the U.S. military would better enhance its capacity for unconventional warfare, counter guerrilla and clandestine operations. There was a new and pressing need for more advanced military techniques during the time. Among other missions, the SEALs were deployed to act as advisers and train South Vietnamese commandos. Vietnam was the first American war to be broadcast widely on television and media, and woven into popular culture for mainstream consumption. It solidified the image of the SEALs as the ultimate tough guy, a reputation burnished by reports of SEALs' ability to do face-to-face combat with Vietcong and stories of their work with the CIA. The relationship between America's spy agency and its elite troops was crucial to gaining real-time intelligence for missions sometimes carried out at the last minute -- perhaps an asset more important now than ever, experts have said. The war against al Qaeda is just as much about obtaining reliable intelligence as it is winning on the battlefield. SEALs victories have been many. During Vietnam, they performed a covert operation called the Phoenix Program which captured Vietcong sympathizers. In the Iran-Iraq war, SEAL teams conducted missions to counter Iranian mine-laying boats. The first military flag officer to set foot in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, was a SEAL in charge of all special operations for Central Command, according to the SEALs history page on its web site. The site says SEALs commanded Task Force K-BAR which oversaw the Navy, Air Force and Coalition Special Operation Forces at the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom which carried out more than 75 special reconnaissance and direct action missions, destroyed more than 500,000 pounds of explosives and weapons, identified enemy personnel and conducted operations that searched for terrorists trying to flee the country by sea. The largest deployment of SEALs in the group's history came during the Iraq War, with SEALs directing missions that included securing all of the southern oil infrastructures of the Al-Faw peninsula and the off-shore gas and oil terminals, clearing critical waterways so that aid could flow into the country. Several high-value terrorist targets were captured by the SEALs, including Ahmed Hashim Abed, the alleged mastermind of the murder and mutilation of four Blackwater guards in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004. Another recent high-profile mission came in 2009 when a SEAL team rescued the American captain of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama, which had been hijacked by Somali pirates off Somalia's coast. SEAL snipers were on the deck of a ship and fired simultaneously three times, hitting three pirates who were holding the captain. Ultimate test . SEAL training is ""the ultimate test for a guy,"" said Chris Heben, a former SEAL with 10 years of experience carrying out missions in Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan. It's social, physical and psychological and tests how well the man can work with others given intense pressure and pain. SEALs train between 18 and 24 months, with the pinnacle of training coming during Hell Week, five days in which trainees are constantly cold, hungry, sleep deprived and wet. During Hell week, instructors deprive the participants of sleep, then let them hit the rack just long enough for REM to begin, said Brandon Tyler Webb, a former SEAL who ran the sniper program at the Navy Special Warfare Command and was part of combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instructors are constantly yelling, ""Go ahead, quit if you like!"" Many do. The attrition rate for SEAL training is about 90 percent, Heben and Webb said. Most recruits drop out long before Hell Week because they can't take the training, which involves running 15 miles, topped with a 2-mile open water swim and other intense physical conditioning, Webb said. ""Every day is like climbing Mount Everest,"" Heben said. ""You just keep doing what's in front of you. You don't look up."" Training instructors make you feel like ""you're part of an Indian tribe,"" Heben said. ""There's a lot of back patting and verbal reinforcement. You feel like you're part of something and you're doing great things. But they definitely let you know when you're not doing something right."" The discipline from SEAL training was intensely satisfying to Heben in his early 20s. He had gone to college, and though he was very bright, he was spending more time working out than on his class work. He was restless. Four walls and books just weren't his thing. Despite unimpressive grades, at 23 he got a job working in home mortgages making $63,000 a year. Then one day he read an article about the SEALs in Popular Mechanics. ""I enlisted in the Navy immediately,"" Heben said. ""I asked the recruiter, 'What is the fastest track to becoming a SEAL? I'll take that.'"" Though he won't discuss specific areas of countries where he's carried out missions, he said that he normally trained for missions on exact mock-ups of a targeted location.","Most of those killed in Afghanistan helicopter crash were Navy Seals, officials say .

1193,"(CNN) -- A satellite and the unmanned rocket that carried it apparently crashed into the Pacific Ocean shortly after lifting off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Friday morning, NASA said. A protective shell atop the Taurus XL rocket did not separate as planned, slowing the rocket and preventing it from going into orbit, NASA officials said, citing initial information. The rocket carried a satellite, known as Glory, that was to have collected information to help scientists better understand the Earth's climate. The satellite and rocket apparently fell into the southern Pacific, they said. ""This is a pretty tough night for all of us,"" said NASA official Ron Grabe. The mission was designed to collect data that scientists planned to use to better understand how the sun and tiny atmospheric particles called aerosols affect the Earth's climate. NASA went into contingency mode about six minutes into the launch at 5:09 a.m. ET. ""Glory Launch: It looks like we have a problem with launch. Standby,"" NASA said on Twitter. ""The launch team is working through its launch contingency plan, including collecting data from the launch.""","NEW: Rocket, satellite thought to be in Pacific .

1194,"(CNN) -- Still using crutches to walk, Tina Fletcher is the most recent victim of a gulf sturgeon strike while on the Suwannee River in Florida. ""I have been on the river my whole life,"" she says. ""For some freak accident like this to happen -- it's just crazy."" It was Memorial Day weekend when Fletcher and her boyfriend borrowed a friend's airboat for a joyride on the river. Fletcher was seated with one leg bent on her chair and the other leg stretched out straight atop a footrest when a sturgeon jumped in front of the boat. ""When the fish was coming down I was like, 'Oh my gosh, it's going to hit me!' so I went to pull my leg up, and when I pulled my leg up I made it about halfway -- like about my calf muscle,"" recalls Fletcher. ""Then the fish collided with my leg."" Jumping fish break boater's leg . The impact broke her tibia and her fibula, sending Fletcher to the hospital for the remainder of the holiday weekend. ""The report said it [the sturgeon] was between 4 and 6 feet and between 60 or 70 pounds,"" says Fletcher. ""But I think it was bigger than 60 to 70 pounds. It looked huge."" It may have looked huge, but it was a relatively small fish considering that gulf sturgeon can grow up to 8 feet long and weigh up to 200 pounds. ""They're really bony, hard fish,"" explains Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) Officer Dorvan Daniel ""It's like an alligator on the outside of their skin. They're really almost as hard as a rock."" As the Fourth of July approaches, public services announcements warn of firework and campfire dangers, but near the Suwannee River in Northwest Florida the message to the public is: Beware of flying fish. ""We don't want to scare anyone off the river,"" says Karen Parker, FWC spokesperson, ""but we do want to make people aware that these fish they do jump and people have gotten injured by them."" In 2010 there were no injuries by sturgeon reported. ""We were hoping for another quiet year like that,"" says Parker, ""but we've already had nine encounters so far this year."" The encounters occur when a sturgeon jumps out of the river as a watercraft is approaching and just as the fish is on its downfall it lands in the vehicle. ""There's a bunch of theories out there, but we're not really sure why they jump out of the water,"" says FWC Biologist Allen Martin. The largest population of gulf sturgeon can be found in the Suwannee River, Martin says. The sturgeon travel into the river from the Gulf of Mexico every summer to spawn. ""The Suwannee is the last of what they call 'wild rivers' left in Florida,"" explains Parker, ""There's no dams or man made structures in it. So the sturgeons can get on in and up here."" Parker estimates that between 10,000 and 14,000 of these fish swim into the river every season. The spawning season takes place when the weather is warm, schools are on summer break and most companies are closed for the long holiday weekends. These factors contribute to the river's popularity as a place for people to celebrate. Daniel works hard to assure that celebrations do not turn into catastrophes. A few years ago, Daniel witnessed a sturgeon jump out of the water and hit a 9-year-old girl in the face. ""I heard the thump, and I saw a young girl fly out of the boat, not just fall out of the boat, she actually went up in the air,"" recalls Daniel. ""Probably about 15 feet up and out of the boat and she hit the water."" When the little girl was rescued from the water she had two deep lacerations on her jaw and neck, Daniel remembers. He guesses the sturgeon that hit her was 5 feet long and weighed about 70 pounds. Witnessing that accident has changed the way Daniel patrols the 30-mile stretch of river that he is assigned. In the past, Daniel would occasionally warn boaters about the dangers of the jumping fish. ""Now it's almost every boat I will stop and say, 'Watch out for these sturgeons, they are really dangerous,'"" he warns. ""I wouldn't sit anybody up front."" The front of the boat is where Fletcher was sitting when she was injured. Since her accident, Fletcher doesn't even want to be on the back of a boat on the Suwannee River. She admits it may take some time to get over her fear of the flying fish, but in the meantime she is trying to keep a sense of humor about her accident.

1195,"(CNN) -- The first democratically elected president of Zambia, who become the focus of a lengthy corruption trial during his retirement, died at his home early Saturday, his spokesman said. Frederick Chiluba was 68. He ruled the nation from 1991 to 2001. ""The death was a surprise for us because he was normal during the day,"" spokesman Emmanuel Mwamba said by phone from Lusaka. ""He met some people, had appointments and consulted. It was a normal day."" Mwamba said a doctor came to the former leader's home hours before he died after he complained of stomach pains. He was treated and appeared fine, but later became unconscious. He died surrounded by his wife and some relatives, the spokesman said. The former president suffered from heart problems during his retirement and had undergone treatment overseas. Chiluba took over after 27 years of one-party rule under strongman Kenneth Kaunda. In the early stages of his presidency, Chiluba became popular for setting up political reforms in the nation. He later resorted to an autocratic rule that especially targeted opposition rivals and outspoken journalists. An attempted military coup to oust him in 1997 failed, leading Chiluba to throw some of his opponents in prison, including Kaunda. After unsuccessfully trying to amend the constitution to extend his two terms in office, Chiluba handed over to his hand-picked successor, Levy Mwanawasa. Shortly after the successor took office, he turned on Chiluba and called for a corruption trial against him. A London court convicted him of fraud in absentia and ordered him to repay millions of dollars in government funds, but Zambia did not honor the ruling. The trial was held in London because some of the alleged corruption occurred there. Chiluba accused Britain, which colonized Zambia, of interfering with the nation's judicial system. Zambia acquitted him of additional corruption charges  in 2009. Journalist Chibaula Silwamba  contributed to this report from Lusaka, Zambia .","Chiluba ruled the country  from 1991 to 2001 .

1196,"(CNN) -- Authorities have ordered the evacuation of some 12,000 people from the city of Minot, North Dakota, and surrounding areas because of expected record flooding, officials said Tuesday. The swollen Souris River flows straight through the city and is expected to overwhelm area levees, said Cecily Fong, spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. Minot, located in the north central part of the state, is the fourth-largest city in North Dakota. The evacuation order covers between a quarter and a third of the city's population, Fong said. Residents have until 6 p.m. CT Wednesday to leave their homes. ""We're going to become a pool,"" Minot Mayor Curt Zimbelman told KXMB-TV in Bismarck. ""It's hard to really believe, but I have some real concerns."" The National Weather Service has forecast record flooding and urged anyone living in the affected areas to prepare immediately for oncoming floodwaters. Heavy area rains and dam releases are causing the river to swell at Minot. ""The current best estimate for when water will overtop the lowest dikes in the Minot area is sometime on Thursday afternoon. However, a Wednesday night or early Thursday timeframe cannot be ruled out as the dikes become more stressed due to rising water,"" the weather service said. The river at Minot, which currently stands at close to 1,555 feet above sea level, is forecast to rise to 1,559 feet on Friday or Saturday -- which would be a new record. The river hit 1,558 feet above sea level in 1881. The Souris River looks like a ""U.""

1197,"Paris (CNN) -- A French magistrate is investigating Airbus for involuntary manslaughter in connection with the mysterious 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 into the southern Atlantic Ocean, according to the airline manufacturer and a court spokeswoman. Judge Sylvie Zimmerman is presiding over the inquiry into the Airbus-made plane, court spokeswoman Sylvie Polack told CNN on Thursday. The plane fell into the sea while traveling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people aboard. Thomas Enders, CEO of Airbus, disagreed with the decision to commence the investigation, he said in a statement. ""On behalf of Airbus, I have noted the absence of facts supporting this step and stated our strong disagreement,"" Enders said. ""Airbus maintains that the focus should be on finding the cause of this accident and making sure it can never happen again. Airbus will continue to support the investigation, including the continued search for the flight recorders, which is the only sure way to know the truth,"" Enders said. Investigators have not yet established what caused the crash, and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found, despite an extensive search operation that included a French navy submarine. The plane went down in stormy weather, and most of the bodies were never recovered. Studies of the debris and bodies that were found led France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the BEA revealed in a 2009 report. Automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed, the investigators said, though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster. The area where the plane went down is far out in the Atlantic -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in West Africa. The rough underwater terrain includes mountains and valleys, the BEA said.

1199,"(CNN) -- The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected Monday to visit a Nebraska power plant surrounded by Missouri River floodwater. The Fort Calhoun Nuclear Station, about 20 miles north of Omaha, Nebraska, is one of two in the state that has been getting increased attention from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission amid historic flooding along the Missouri River. The Fort Calhoun plant, which has been shut down since April for refueling, has as much as two feet of water in places. The plant's parking lot is among the areas flooded, requiring plant workers to navigate a catwalk to reach the plant. The other plant, Cooper Nuclear Station, sits on higher ground and continues to operate. NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko is scheduled to visit the Fort Calhoun plant on Monday morning. Although an inflatable water-filled structure called an aqua berm surrounding the plant was punctured by machinery early Sunday morning, key areas of the facility are not in danger of being flooded, the NRC and the owner of the Fort Calhoun plant said. ""The plant is still protected. This was an additional, a secondary, level of protection that we had put up,"" said Mike Jones, a spokesman for the Omaha Public Power District. ""The plant remains protected to the level it would have been if the aqua berm had not been added."" Plant workers briefly switched to diesel backup generators to keep nuclear fuel at the site cool because water had gotten too close to electrical transformers, Jeff Hanson, a spokesman for the utility, said Monday. The plant was again drawing power from the electrical grid, he said. In addition to the berm, authorities have put in place floodgates, sandbags and other barriers to help protect the facility. As precautions, workers have been given satellite phones and extra food is stockpiled at the plant according to the NRC. Plant managers also have brought in additional diesel fuel should the site lose electricity, according to the NRC. The aqua berm -- an 8-foot-tall, water-filled berm, 16 feet wide at its base -- surrounded the reactor containment structure and auxiliary buildings, according to the NRC. A representative of the manufacturer is at the plant helping assess whether the berm can be repaired, Hanson said. With or without the berm, the chances of floodwater getting into the building where the core is kept are almost zero, said Dave Van Der Kamp, with the Nebraska Public Power District. The plant is designed to withstand water up to 1,014 feet above mean sea level, according to the Omaha Public Power District. The river currently stands at 1,006.3 feet and is not expected to exceed 1,008 feet, the OPPD said. ""We built the plant up high enough based on history, based on the flooding in the past. If the flood would rise for some reason above that level we have taken precautions, again, per our procedures to sandbag the important equipment for the reactors,"" Van Der Kamp said. It was catastrophic flooding from Japan's March 11 tsunami that knocked out cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, resulting in three reactors melting down and producing the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. This year's Midwestern flooding has also led to a spate of rumors about the Fort Calhoun plant that OPPD and the NRC have been trying to knock down. The utility has set up a ""flood rumor control"" page to reassure the public that there has been no release of radioactivity from the plant. An electrical fire June 7 did knock out cooling to its spent fuel storage pool for about 90 minutes, but the coolant water did not reach a boiling point before backup pumps went into service, it has said. Heavy rainfall in Montana and North Dakota, combined with melting snow from the Rocky Mountains, have sent the Missouri surging downstream this summer. The river washed over and punched through levees in northwestern Missouri, spurring authorities to urge about 250 nearby residents to leave their homes. The 6 to 12 inches of rainfall in the upper Missouri basin in the past few weeks is nearly a normal year's worth, and runoff from the mountain snowpack is 140% of normal, according to forecasters. The Missouri River is forecast to remain at record or near-record levels from south of Omaha all the way to Atchison, Kansas, into next week. The flooding is affecting communities in Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri.

1200,"(CNN)  -- Doctors will attempt to determine Monday why actor John Travolta's teenage son died. An autopsy is scheduled for Monday to determine Jett Travolta's cause of death. Jett Travolta, 16, was found unconscious Friday while on vacation with his family in the Bahamas. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital and pronounced dead on arrival, local police said. Doctors will conduct an autopsy Monday, and the boy's body later will be transferred to Ocala, Florida, for burial, Travolta attorney Michael Ossi said. In a statement posted on the actor's Web site, Travolta and his wife, Kelly Preston, described Jett as ""the most wonderful son that two parents could ever ask for and lit up the lives of everyone he encountered.""

The Travoltas, who arrived in the Bahamas on Tuesday, bought property there several years earlier, said former Bahamian Tourism Minister Obie Wilchcomb, who rushed to the hospital Friday to be with the family. ""Mr. Travolta spent a tremendous amount of time with his son Jett. He never left him at home. He always brought him with him. And once you saw John Travolta, you saw his son Jett. They were very close, very affectionate. Lots of love you see at all times,"" Wilchcomb told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" The teen had a developmental disability that his parents have linked to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder of the artery walls that most commonly occurs in young children and that can lead to heart disease. According to the American Heart Association, ""About 80 percent of the people with Kawasaki disease are under age 5. Children over age 8 are rarely affected.""  Watch CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta discuss Kawasaki disease » . The causes of Kawasaki disease are unknown. Some scientists think it's caused by an infectious agent, such as a virus. Some studies have noted a link between the disease and carpet-cleaning chemicals. ""With my son ... I was obsessive about cleaning -- his space being clean, so we constantly had the carpets cleaned,"" John Travolta told CNN's King in 2001. ""And I think, between him, the fumes and walking around, maybe picking up pieces or something, he got what is rarely a thing to deal with, but it's Kawasaki syndrome."" The boy was about 2 at the time he developed the illness, the actor said. The Travoltas also have a daughter, Ella, 8.

1202,"(CNN) -- British rider Mark Cavendish won the fifth stage of this year's Tour de France after a mass sprint saw him narrowly beat Belgium's Philippe Gilbert and Spain's Jose Joaquin Rojas. Cavendish, 26, a sprint specialist who has now won 16 stages of the Tour de France since 2008, edged what had been an eventful, crash-filled race. Both Janez Brajkovic and defending champion Alberto Contador fell during the 164.5 kilometer stretch from Carhaix to Cap Frehel, the former being taken to hospital with head injuries. The Slovenian later retired from the race altogether. Norwegian Thor Hushovd retained the leader's yellow jersey after finishing tenth. ""I think what the organizers have done this year is to make it harder to have a proper bunch sprint. That's because we have been dominating in the last years,"" Cavendish, widely regarded as the best sprint cyclist in the sport, told the Tour de France's official website shortly after the race. ""The reason why we dominate the sprint at the Tour de France is, well, for me personally I have put every other race on the back foot to be good at the Tour de France."" This year will be the 98th edition of the race, the most famous in cycling and one of the world's best known sporting events. Cavendish, who was disqualified from an intermediate sprint in the third stage for illegally butting Hushovd -- who was also censured -- will find the next stage much harder: the sixth, 226.5 kilometer stage between Dinan and Lisieux is Le Tour's longest. ""That was a proper hard finish,"" Cavendish admitted. ""Those last couple of hundred meters my legs were going...I'm really happy with that.""","Mark Cavendish wins fifth stage of Tour de France .

1203,"(CNN) -- An Illinois woman died Monday after participating in New York City's Nautica Triathlon on Sunday, the second athlete to do so. Amy Martich died at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City -- a day after a man died after participating in the swim portion of the triathlon, according to hospital spokeswomen Elizabeth Dowling and Terry Cavanaugh. New York Police Department spokesman Lieutenant John Grimpel identified the deceased athletes as Martich, 40, and Mike Kudryk, 64. Bill Burke, director for the triathlon, told CNN he was ""deeply saddened"" by the participants' deaths. Martich, of Elmhurst, Illinois, was rescued halfway through the swim portion of the triathlon and transported to 79th Street's Dock A, where she was treated by on-site emergency medical staff, Burke said. Kudryk was two-thirds of the way through the swim portion of the triathlon when a CNN employee, also competing, noticed a man floating on his back with his head beneath the water. ""It didn't look like he was breathing, his lips were blue,"" remembered Jeff Kepnes, supervising producer for CNN Special Events. Shortly after, Kepnes says he struggled to help lift Kudryk's body onto a rescue sled along with another rescuer. ""We tried to maneuver him,"" Kepnes said. ""He was heavy, he wasn't moving. We were being weighed down."" This is the third triathlon for Kepnes, who said the water was the choppiest he's ever seen it on Sunday. ""I did notice that there were more people going into safety stroke. There were more conversations with rescue in the kayaks and Jet Skis,"" Kepnes said. Kudryk was driven to one of four New York City Fire Department boats stationed in the river, where he was treated by paramedics on board before being taken to the emergency medical station on Dock A, Burke said. Both Martich and Kudryk were transferred to St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center just after 8 a.m. on Sunday, Burke said. Kudryk died shortly after arriving at the emergency room, Cavanaugh said. The Nautical New York City Triathlon is an Olympic distance race, consisting of a 1,500-meter swim, a 40-kilometer bike ride and a 10-kilometer run, according to the event's website. Burke said the swim portion of the triathlon, which took place in the Hudson River Sunday, was staffed with ""32 lifeguards, 53 kayakers patrolling the water, three launch boats, two Jet Skis with sleds"" and three NYPD boats equipped with divers and paramedics. Burke said he initially delayed the race by several minutes due to inclement weather. ""I was watching a line of thunderstorms come toward the course, I was waiting to see if it was going to materialize and if we would have a lightning problem,"" he said. In addition, Burke said an accident on the Hudson Parkway, which caused a downhill portion of the bike path to be slicked by oil and gasoline, pushed the race's starting time back by about 40 minutes. Burke said he got a phone call from NYPD that the bike path was cleared by 6:19 a.m., and the race began by 6:30 a.m. Manhattan Borough president Scott Stringer sent a letter to Burke Monday requesting a ""top to bottom review of the safety protocol for the triathlon,"" he told CNN. ""New Yorkers signed up for a triathlon -- not a game of Russian Roulette,"" Stringer said in a press release Monday.

1205,"(CNN) -- A 10-month-old Indiana boy born with a fatal genetic disorder died Sunday at a North Carolina hospital where he had gone in hope of receiving a potentially life-saving organ transplant, his parents said in a Facebook post. Seth Petreikis, after having open heart surgery when he was about 2 1/2 weeks old, was diagnosed with complete DiGeorge syndrome, a rare disease that left him with no immune system. However, it was not Seth's heart or the complete DiGeorge syndrome that ultimately caused his death, his mother said in the same Facebook post. Baby Seth died from complications resulting from a problem with his airway. Seth went to Duke University Hospital to receive a thymus transplant. The procedure was pioneered by Duke's Dr. M. Louise Markert, the only doctor at the only hospital in the United States that performs the surgery. Seth's condition resulted from the absence of a thymus gland, which produces T cells, a type of white blood cell that helps protect the body from infection, Markert told HLN in a television interview in December. Without T cells, Seth had no way to fight infections, Markert explained. Sixty infants with complete DiGeorge syndrome have received transplants and 43, or 72%, survived, according to Duke University Hospital. But Seth's family hit a roadblock when coverage for the transplant was denied by MDwise, an Indiana Medicaid administrator that was their insurer, because the surgery was considered experimental. The cost of the surgery was an estimated $500,000, which Seth's parents told CNN they could not afford. Seth's plight became the focus of many media reports. MDwise eventually reversed its decision and agreed to cover the transplant. ""Based on Seth's unique and compelling story, we believe making a compassionate allowance in this case is appropriate,"" said Caroline Carney Doebbeling, MDwise chief medical officer, in a press release issued after the reversal of its decision. But last week, doctors determined Seth had a severe tracheomalacia, meaning his airway was so floppy it could not sustain itself. Seth would have needed to be on ventilation for years, and he would not have been eligible for the thymus transplant during that time because of the ventilation. It would have been impossible for Seth to stay free of infections and viruses for those years, Seth's mother, Becky Petreikis, explained on the Facebook page. ""Pray for Seth Petreikis."" ""He was such a little fighter. It was an honor to be his mom for 10 months,"" she wrote. Seth's funeral will be Saturday morning in Crown Point, Indiana.","Baby Seth went to a North Carolina hospital in hope of an organ transplant .

1207,"Madrid (CNN) -- The first day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona on Thursday was a swift race through old town for hundreds of runners trying to stay a step ahead of the raging bulls, but just four runners went to the hospital with injuries, officials said. Commentators on Spanish state television TVE considered it a relatively safe start to the dangerous annual tradition in Pamplona, which has tallied thousands of injuries and 15 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924, including the fatal goring of a Spanish man in 2009. The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title ""Fiesta."" It is now broadcast live across Spain by state television TVE, which pays Pamplona for exclusive rights, and positions some 20 cameras along the course. A Red Cross official at the scene initially said just one runner went to the hospital, but the Navarra regional government issued a medical report later showing that four male runners were taken to hospitals. The most seriously injured was a 40-year-old Spanish man who suffered broken ribs and a fractured shoulder blade and remained hospitalized later Thursday. The other three were released from the hospital hours after arriving. They included two Spaniards, one with bruised ribs and the other with an eye injury, and a Panamanian man, 35, with a nose injury. Television images showed numerous runners falling hard to the pavement and the bulls trying to step over them. Most of the runners were men, mainly dressed in the traditional white outfits with red handkerchiefs, but there was also a small number of women. The six bulls were from the Torrestrella breeding ranch and weigh between 470 kgs to 635 kgs (about 1,034 pounds to 1,397 pounds). Accompanied by a pack of tame steers, they exited the corral just 10 seconds after the opening rocket was fired to signal the start of the run. They moved quickly along the 825-meter (902 yard) course, and it took two minutes and 30 seconds until the bulls reached the corrals of the bull ring. The bulls face certain death against matadors in a bullfight later in the day. Pamplona's new mayor, Enrique Maya, told TVE  just before the race that he had never run. He said he watched it from one of the numerous balconies along the course, which are filled with local residents or visitors, the latter typically paying top dollar for a safe vantage point. The daily run continues for eight days, through July 14, at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET).

1208,"(CNN) -- The end of the line for three fugitive siblings came Wednesday on a rural stretch of Colorado interstate. With guns scattered around their wrecked white Subaru, the suspects made their play. One brother stayed in the car. Another brother stumbled off through the brush to a couple of nearby businesses, only to be picked up after a citizen spotted him, authorities told CNN. The sister, who wrote on her Flickr profile that she liked ""causing mayhem with my siblings,"" tried to reload her automatic pistol, officials said. A police officer shot her in the leg. In custody Wednesday evening, the ""Dougherty family"" survived a dramatic final scene that seemed foreshadowed. ""It was going to happen somewhere,"" Pueblo County Sheriff Kirk Taylor said. Last week, Ryan Edward Dougherty, 21, texted, ""There's a time for all of us to die"" after he was sentenced in Florida on a criminal charge, according to a Florida sheriff's office. With that, authorities said, Ryan Dougherty, sister Lee Grace Dougherty, 29; and half-brother Dylan Dougherty Stanley, 26, began a crime spree that included a bank robbery in Georgia and the attempted murder of a Florida police officer. According to Taylor, the trio spent Tuesday night in the San Isabel National Forest about 10 to 12 miles west of Colorado City. The Colorado Springs Gazette quoted a store employee as saying the three apparently purchased a tent at a recreation supply retailer in the city on Tuesday. Their run ended Wednesday morning on Interstate 25 between Colorado City and the town of Walsenburg, authorities said. A deputy spotted the suspect vehicle at a gas station after it left the campground, officials said. It was now bearing Texas tags, Taylor said. Officers were preparing to apprehend the occupants when the car pulled away. A 20-mile high-speed chase ensued. Reaching speeds of more than 100 miles per hour, the fugitives shot at officers, who did not return fire, authorities said. Colorado state troopers deployed a tire-deflation device, and that was the beginning of the end. A MAC-11 machine pistol, a handgun and two AK-47 rifles came flying out when the vehicle flipped and landed on a guard rail, Taylor said. All three of the Doughertys suffered injuries. They were treated and put in custody. They were being held Wednesday evening in Pueblo County as state, federal and local officials discuss when the trio may be returned to Georgia or Florida. The Colorado State Patrol sent a Twitter message indicating each was being charged with four counts of first-degree assault on a police officer. The suspects are wanted for a bank robbery in Valdosta, Georgia, and the attempted murder of a Florida police officer. ""I am proud to say today we won,"" said Sheriff Chris Nocco of Pasco County, Florida, where one incident occurred earlier this month. ""The three Doughertys were speeding,"" Nocco told reporters. ""It's ironic they didn't learn their lesson. The Colorado State Patrol attempted to pull them over. In that attempt to pull them over, the Doughertys went back to their MO and started shooting at law enforcement."" On Tuesday, a U.S. magistrate issued warrants for the siblings' arrest in connection with the August 2 bank robbery, where an AK-47-type assault rifle and a machine pistol were used. They are also suspects in the attempted murder of a Zephyrhills, Florida, police officer that took place the same day -- but five hours earlier and 200 miles away. The officer wasn't injured, though occupants in the getaway vehicle fired numerous rounds during a chase that reached up to 100 miles per hour, according to the Pasco County, Florida, Sheriff's Office. One round struck a tire, disabling the police vehicle, the sheriff's office said. Since then, the siblings had been the subject of an interstate manhunt, with their faces plastered on hundreds of digital billboards from Florida to Kentucky to Texas. According to a timeline of events that officials provided, Ryan Dougherty was sentenced August 1 in Volusia County, Florida, to 10 years' probation and two years of community control monitoring for convictions on two counts of sending harmful information to a minor. After the sentencing, he sent his mother a text message: ""There's a time for all of us to die,"" according to the sheriff's office. At 6:30 a.m. August 2, a witness saw all three siblings leave in a white four-door vehicle from their Lacoochee home. At 6:59 a.m., Ryan Dougherty cut off his GPS monitoring ankle bracelet near Zephyrhills, the sheriff's office said. At 7:12 a.m. August 2, the shooting with the Florida police officer occurred, after which 20 high-caliber casings were found at the scene, the sheriff's office said. The five-mile pursuit began after the officer tried to pull the vehicle over for speeding on State Road 54 in Zephyrhills, 30 miles northeast of Tampa, authorities said. Then came the armed bank robbery at a CertusBank in Valdosta, at 12:24 p.m. the same day, the FBI said. During that robbery, three people dressed in black with masks entered the bank's front entrance, the FBI said. Shots were fired at the ceiling, and everyone was told to get down, the bureau said. At least two of the robbers were armed, and the third obtained an undisclosed amount of cash, the FBI said. The two brothers have been living in the same rented residence the past three years in Lacoochee, which is located in Pasco County, the sheriff's office said. Their sister, who had been living with her boyfriend in Orlando, just began staying with her brothers, the sheriff's office said. With the most extensive record of the three, Ryan Edward Dougherty has had 14 felony arrests since 2007, including for alleged burglary, destroying evidence and probation violation, according to the sheriff's office. Lee Grace Dougherty's criminal background includes five felony charges. Three of them are pending, all of them hit-and-run offenses in Cocoa Beach, Florida, the Pasco County Sheriff's office said. Her record also contains six misdemeanor charges, the sheriff's office said. Dylan Dougherty Stanley's criminal record shows a possession of marijuana charge, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office didn't have information on the disposition of the past charges against the brothers and sister. It released photos of Lee Grace Dougherty, with a description of tattoos. Public information officer Douglas Tobin confirmed the photos were taken from the suspect's Flickr page, which was established in September 2010. Photos, many from March 2011, show Dougherty in various poses. ""I have a huge crazy family. I'm 28 but act like I'm 17 most of the time,"" the profile reads. ""I love to farm and shoot guys and wreck cars. I'm a redneck and proud of it. I like milk and German engineering and causing mayhem with my siblings."" CNN's Kara Devlin, Brian Todd, Dugald McConnell and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Charges filed after high-speed chase in Colorado .

1209,"(CNN) -- U.S. and Mexican search teams scoured the Sea of Cortez for seven Americans still missing after a tourist boat capsized Sunday off the east coast of Mexico's Baja California peninsula and killed one American tourist. Visibility was clear and the water was warm in the sea, also called the Gulf of California, but rescuers had not found any survivors since Monday, Coast Guard Lt. Bill Burwell told CNN. However, he remained optimistic. ""If someone is out there, there is a good chance that they are still surviving, and we will keep looking for them,"" he said. The boat was carrying more than 40 people when it capsized. Harry Edwards, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said Tuesday that so far 19 American passengers have been rescued. But the search continues for seven more American passengers, he said. U.S. authorities identified the killed American as Leslie Yee. Her city of residence was not immediately available, authorities said. ""The State Department expresses its condolences to the victim's family and remains in contact with the survivors and families of the missing,"" the agency said in a statement. There were conflicting numbers on how many people were on the boat when it sank. Mexican authorities counted 43 passengers and crew, while the Coast Guard put the number at 44. One of the surviving tourists is Charles Gibson, the chief of police services at Contra Costa Community College District in California. Gibson is an avid fisherman and has participated in the same deep sea fishing trip several times, said Contra Costa Community College spokesman Tim Leong. Gibson's family has been in contact with him but Leong declined further comment about the circumstances of the incident pending Gibson's return from Mexico. According to the Contra Costa Community College website, Gibson served in the U.S. Navy where he was assigned to the USS Ranger. He served two terms in Vietnam and received the Vietnam Service Medal. Burwell said the Americans had a C-130 aircraft on scene helping with the search, and were plotting the drift from the site of the incident. Mexican authorities also had assets aiding in the search, he said. The C-130 is equipped with survival gear, rafts and electronic sonar that can detect beacons and people in water, said Ron Clark, U.S. Auxiliary Flotilla Commander.  The plane, which will cover a broad swath of the sea in the area, arrived after Coast Guard crews on Monday flew an H-60 Jayhawk helicopter over more than 42 miles of water. The C-130 can fly as low as 1,000 feet and is expected to search for five hours, Clark said. The C-130 and the Mexican navy reported no sightings of the seven missing Americans as of Tuesday afternoon, said Petty Officer 2nd class Levi Read of the Coast Guard. The C-130 has been searching waters around the accident since 2 p.m. ET as Mexican authorities continued their search by helicopter, plane, boats and on-shore vehicles, said Read. All 16 crew members of the Erik survived; another who had been on the list of crew members apparently failed to embark, a Mexican official said, citing passengers' accounts. The Erik sank in the Sea of Cortez, near Isla San Luis, Mexico, east of Baja, at 2:30 a.m. Sunday, the Coast Guard said. ""They ran into some bad weather, capsized, the boat sank,"" said Petty Officer 2nd Class Henry Dunphy, a spokesman for the Coast Guard in San Diego. Several people swam to shore, walked to the nearest town and alerted the Mexican navy to what had happened, he added. But the Mexican navy said it was alerted by the cook of the boat, who was rescued by fishermen along with two passengers. He told officials that 27 tourists had been aboard the Erik when it sank approximately 60 nautical miles south of San Felipe, the navy said in a news release. All the rescued people were in good health and were taken to their hotels, with the exception of one person with diabetes who remained under observation, the navy said. ""We have been working with Mexican navy authorities and the U.S. Coast Guard in the search and rescue,"" Baja Sportfishing Inc. said in an e-mail. ""Right now our main concern is making sure that everyone is accounted for."" The Erik was a 115-foot fishing boat with a 24-foot beam, according to the company's website. ""Built in Holland, she was equipped with stabilizers to handle the turbulent North Sea,"" it said. Later Monday, the website added, ""Due to events occurring at this moment, all further trips are canceled."" Mike Flynn, an advertising representative who had booked the Erik for an excursion in October, said the boat specializes in fishing trips. The boat serves as a ""mother ship"" that carries its passengers out to sea, where they then use smaller boats to fish for the day before returning, Flynn said. The Erik offered three meals a day, showers and other amenities for its guests, he said.

1213,"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Defense Department Thursday released the names of U.S. military personnel killed in Saturday's downing of a helicopter in Afghanistan. Thirty-eight people were killed in that attack, eight of them Afghan military personnel. It was the single largest loss of life for U.S. troops since the Afghan war began in late 2001. Of the 30 Americans killed in the helicopter crash, 17 were Navy SEALs. Twenty-two of the dead were U.S. Navy personnel, the Pentagon said. Fifteen were SEALs belonging to the top-secret unit that conducted the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden at a compound in Pakistan. Two others were SEALs assigned to a regular Naval special operations unit. Five were so-called conventional forces with particular specialties who regularly worked with the SEALs. The other eight U.S. troops killed included three Air Force forward air controllers and five Army helicopter crew members. NATO said it killed the militants responsible for the attack.

1214,"Beijing (CNN) -- China's second-largest train manufacturer will recall 54 bullet trains running on the new Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway after a series of malfunctions, a company official said Friday. The state-owned CNR Corporation earlier this week suspended deliveries of the same model for safety reasons. ""All decisions are based on safety and we are trying to be responsible,"" said Tan Xiaofeng, a company spokesman. The news came on the heels of a Chinese government announcement to slow down bullet trains nationwide and halt approval for new construction, amid increasing public scrutiny on the country's railway safety following a crash last month that killed at least 40 people. Premier Wen Jiabao this week also ordered railway authorities, who had planned to invest over $400 billion into new projects in the next five years, to conduct thorough safety inspections on all high-speed rail lines both in operation and under construction, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. ""Right now we are checking and eliminating all potential safety vulnerabilities,"" railway minister Sheng Guangzu said in Thursday's edition of the People's Rail newspaper. ""Down the road we want to strengthen our management to ensure rail operations be safe, sustainable and stable."" Sheng said bullet trains would run 40 to 50 kilometers below their top design speed, which currently stands at 350 kilometers per hour (217 mph) for the fastest model, and ticket prices would be reduced accordingly. The actions were prompted by the government after a stalled bullet train was struck from behind by another train on July 23 near Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang province, causing one of China's deadliest rail accidents in recent years. Railway officials later blamed design flaws in the rail signal equipment as the culprit. Many in the public remain skeptical of the finding, still fuming over reports that the railway ministry ended its search-and-rescue effort less than six hours after the collision, and moved to crush and bury one of the six derailed cars when the investigation had barely started. Although railway authorities have denied such allegations, a panel consisted of high-ranking government officials -- none from the railway ministry -- and academic experts has taken over the investigation and is expected to produce its report in September. Reactions were mixed to the government decision to decelerate the country's trains. ""This is a rational policy to correct the 'great leap forward' strategy of our high-speed railway development,"" Professor Zhao Jian, a transportation expert with Beijing Jiaotong University, told CNN. ""It should have been done earlier -- but this is a good start."" Zhao, a long-time critic of China's high-speed rail plans, said slower trains would improve safety and cut operational cost, benefiting both operators and passengers. But others compare the new measure to ""stopping eating after choking on food."" ""The problem is obviously with management, but they simply decided to reduce the speed,"" a user named ""usinner"" wrote on Shanghai Metrofans, a popular railway internet forum. ""If they don't address the real problem, trains are still going to crash even when running below 100 kilometers per hour."" Now the world's second-largest economy, and flush with cash, China has built the world's longest high-speed rail network -- boasting more than 8,300 kilometers (5,100 miles) of routes -- in a few short years. Officials have portrayed the development of high-speed rail as a symbol of the country's growing prowess and also want to export Chinese technologies to markets that include the United States. The massive investment and rapid construction have long raised public doubts on the new lines' safety and commercial viability. The skeptics' voices became louder after the former railway minister -- a champion of high-speed rail -- was sacked for corruption early this year. Even the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail -- the ministry's newest and proudest project -- has broken down several times since its much-touted launch less than two months ago. ""It's not the faster, the better,"" Sun Zhang, a railway professor at Tongji University in Shanghai -- and now a member of the investigative panel on the deadly crash -- told CNN in June. ""We have to take safety, economics and environmental impact into consideration."" Eager to reassure skeptics home and abroad, Chinese leaders have said the government would learn its lessons from the fatal bullet train collision -- even it means to swallow national pride for now. ""If safety is compromised, there is no credibility to speak of,"" Premier Wen said during a visit to the crash site on July 28. ""It is important that we integrate our effort in pursuing speed, quality, efficiency and safety with the understanding that safety always comes first.""","The recall involves 54 bullet trains made by the state-owned CNR Corporation .

1215,"Atlanta (CNN) -- U.S. safety officials have cited Alabama's Browns Ferry nuclear power plant for a failed valve that could have hindered efforts to cool one of the reactors during an emergency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced Tuesday. The problem in the No. 1 reactor unit has resulted in a top-level ""red finding"" by the NRC, bringing increased federal oversight of the three-unit plant for some time. ""The public was never endangered because no actual event occurred,"" the NRC said in announcing the citation. ""However, the system is counted on for core cooling during certain accident scenarios and the valve failure left it inoperable, which potentially could have led to core damage had an accident involving a series of unlikely events occurred."" Browns Ferry is located outside Athens, Alabama, about 80 miles north of Birmingham. The Tennessee Valley Authority, which owns the plant, had argued against the finding and may appeal the decision, TVA spokesman Ray Golden told CNN. ""We think we have a safe plant,"" he said. ""We have a number of higher safety measures in place. That said, we can do more and are planning to do more."" The bad valve was part of a residual heat removal system that cools the reactors after they shut down. The problem was discovered when the unit was being refueled in October, said Joey Ledford, a spokesman for the NRC regional office in Atlanta. ""This violation will result in additional regional and headquarters inspectors in the plant doing various other additional inspections,"" Ledford said. The plant's ""safety culture"" will be under scrutiny along with its technical systems as a result of the ruling, he said. The citation is the fifth red finding issued by the NRC under a system that went into effect in 2001, Ledford said. It is the first issued to Browns Ferry or to any of TVA's three nuclear plants, Golden said. The 3,200-megawatt Browns Ferry plant remains idled following April 27 tornadoes that knocked out external power to the plant. Unit 1 was the scene of a 1975 fire that damaged the control room's electrical systems, an accident that led to new safety procedures at U.S. nuclear plants. The problem found in October could have led to an increased threat of fire under some conditions, Golden said. ""We acknowledge that we have more work to do in fire protection and are committed to doing that,"" he said. The faulty valve had been in place since Browns Ferry was built in the late 1960s, and its failure was the result of a manufacturing defect, he said. But the utility argued that the reactor had multiple backup systems that operated despite the failed valve, and the faulty device eventually responded properly during laboratory tests. ""It became stuck, but we were able to demonstrate in these labs that if you allowed enough time to go by, it would unstick itself,"" Golden said. The valve was replaced shortly after the problem was found, and was working at the time of the April tornadoes, said Roger Hannah, an NRC spokesman in Washington. The agency cited TVA for failing to identify the problem during earlier inspections, he said. ""We felt they should have identified this valve as a problem before it was discovered,"" Hannah said. CNN's Devon Sayers and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","NEW: The plant's owner may challenge the NRC citation .

1217,"(CNN) -- A wind-fed fire in southern Arizona grew dramatically Friday, racing down from canyons and gobbling parched grasslands and brush. Arizona and New Mexico were under red-flag alerts through the weekend as firefighters battled several blazes in Arizona. Conditions will be especially difficult Sunday at the Monument fire just south of Sierra Vista, Arizona, according to Glenn Lader of the National Weather Service office in Tucson. Relentless winds have spread the 18,580-acre fire that has torched at least 40 homes and forced the evacuation of hundreds Thursday. Evacuations of several areas continued Friday. The Monument fire has spread across the Huachuca Mountains near the Mexican border. The area is known as the ""Sky Islands"" region. ""These mountain 'islands,' forested ranges separated by vast expanses of desert and grassland plains, are among the most diverse ecosystems in the world,"" according to the Sky Island Alliance, a conservation group. Garry Foss, who operates Oaks of the Wild West nursery in Hereford, a community just east of the fire, said grasses 2 to 3 feet tall have not seen rain since December, making for a ready fire fuel source. Sierra Vista, home to the Army's Fort Huachuca, has had 0.13 inches of rain this year, according to Lader, compared with 2.5 to 3 inches in a normal year. There's no rain in the forecast. ""I'm trying to sit it out,"" Foss said, adding that he now has to drive east to Bisbee and northwest to reach Sierra Vista.  ""This grass is so dry."" Much of Highway 92 south of Sierra Vista was ordered closed. A brush fire was reported on Fort Huachuca . Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, meanwhile, issued emergency declarations for the Monument fire and another blaze, Horseshoe II, making Cochise County eligible for $100,000 toward response and recovery expenses. High winds also could undo some of the progress made by crews battling the Wallow blaze, which has burned nearly a half-million acres in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. ""Yes, it is a threat. Anything could happen,"" said Terry Stemmler, a spokesman for the Southwest Incident Management Team. Crews are facing four straight days of red flag warnings that started Thursday with the return of strong winds to a dry region, Stemmler said. A red flag warning means weather conditions -- high winds and low humidity -- pose an extreme risk for fire. ""The hot, dry and windy weather coupled with the drought-stressed vegetation and heavy fuel loading in mixed conifer forests has the potential to create extreme fire behavior,"" officials with the Wallow fire team said. As of Friday morning, the Wallow fire had scorched 495,016 acres -- more than 770 square miles -- in eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, the vast majority of it in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona, authorities said. The blaze, which is 33% contained, became the largest wildfire in Arizona history on Tuesday. CNN's Phil Gast, Samuel Gardner III and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","The Monument fire in southern Arizona burns 18,580 acres .

1218,"(CNN) -- Rescue teams continued scouring waters off Mexico's coast Thursday, searching for seven Americans on a fishing expedition missing since a boat capsized over the weekend. None of the missing had been spotted by Thursday afternoon, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Levi Read told CNN. But he said officials believe they could have survived, helped by warm water temperatures and calm seas. ""Conditions are probably about as good as we can expect,"" he said. One American was killed when the boat with more than 40 people aboard sunk early Sunday in the Sea of Cortez, near Isla San Luis, Mexico, authorities said. Sixteen of 19 Americans that have been rescued returned to the United States Thursday, the government of Mexico's Baja California state said. Three rescued Americans remained in Mexico as the search continued, the government said. Relatives of the seven missing Americans are seeking donations to help continue rescue efforts after Mexican and U.S. teams end the official search. The search has been extended indefinitely, Mexican officials said Thursday. It had originally been scheduled to stop around 2 a.m. Thursday, 96 hours after the boat capsized. The situation has drawn attention from officials in California, the home state of many of the missing. On Wednesday a group of California lawmakers urged federal officials to encourage Mexican authorities to keep searching. ""With the warm weather conditions, we believe the missing family members may be able to survive for additional days at sea or on one of the many islands in the region,"" the lawmakers wrote in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Robert Papp. Family spokesman Frederick Han -- whose 52-year-old father-in-law, Donald Lee, is among the missing -- said he was holding out hope. ""If we know there are still people out there who are going to make the effort to search for them, then we maintain the hope that they're going to be found,"" he said Wednesday. Han said relatives have urged U.S. authorities to play a greater role, and have been getting the word out about the situation online at findourfathers.blogspot.com. Family members also launched a Facebook page ""Find Our Fathers"" and a PayPal account for donations to help with the search and rescue efforts. U.S. and Mexican teams are part of the search, as the boat was carrying citizens of both nations. A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 Hercules aircraft searched a 300-square-mile area near Isla San Luis Thursday. The plane will search the area again Friday, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard said in a statement Thursday that it had searched 1,400 square miles of ocean and land since the Mexican Navy requested assistance in the operation. U.S. authorities identified the American tourist who died as Leslie Yee. In addition to Lee, the missing also include Albert Mein, Russell Bautista, Mark Dorland, Brian Wong, Gene J. Leong and Shawn Chaddock. U.S. and Mexican authorities said there were 43 people on the boat when it sank. The U.S. Coast Guard originally said 44 people were onboard, but changed their number after learning that one person listed on the manifest had never boarded the boat. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","A Coast Guard officer says none of the missing have been spotted .

1219,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan will on Friday begin enforcing an evacuation order on a 20-kilometer zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a top government official said. The restriction --in place since the early days of the nuclear disaster -- has often been ignored. Many of the about 78,000 people who have homes in the evacuation zone have gone back in recent weeks to retrieve belongings, and check on farms and businesses. No one will be allowed within 3 kilometers of the crippled nuclear facility and entry within 20 kilometers of the plant will be highly regulated, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Thursday. People who temporarily return to their homes, businesses and farms must wear a protective suit and ride into the restricted zone on a designated bus. The time limit for such visits will be two hours and everyone who enters will be required to go through a decontamination process. The stricter enforcement within the zone is necessary ""to guarantee the health and safety of the people,"" Edano said previously, noting that Tokyo will work with local officials in closing the zone. Edano said the government plans to designate the area an ""alert zone"" under Japanese laws governing disaster response, a move he said would give authorities the power to crack down on people going into and out of the evacuated area. Police are currently stationed at checkpoints leading into the area, but enforcement appears to vary from post to post or officer to officer. A CNN crew entered the area for a short time Wednesday and encountered a young farmer whose family lives just inside the 20-km (12.5-mile) boundary. He said his father was considering returning home -- but as a young, unmarried man, he was considering quitting the farm his family has worked for three generations. ""I'm concerned about the impact on my health,"" said the farmer, who declined to be named. ""I wish I could trust the government, but I can't."" The disaster, now the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, occurred when the Fukushima Daiichi plant was struck by the March 11 tsunami that devastated northern Japan, knocking out its coolant systems and causing its three operating reactors to overheat. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., said Thursday that a meltdown could be taking place at the troubled facility, but also acknowledged that there's no way to know for sure. TEPCO told CNN that it cannot say that the nuclear fuel rods at the three reactors have never melted or that they are not melting right now, nor can the company say for certain that the rods have melted or are melting now. The Japanese government says it has no detailed readings of radiation levels inside the 20-km zone. But journalists who have entered the areas have recorded radiation levels that typically range around a few thousandths of a millisieverts per hour. By comparison, a typical resident of an industrialized country receives about 3 millisieverts per year. One reporter who came within 2 kilometers of the power plant in early April recorded a dose of about a tenth of a millisievert per hour -- high enough to increase the long-term risk of cancer with prolonged exposure, but a tiny fraction of the dose that would induce radiation sickness.","Evacuation order covers zone within 20-kilometers of the nuclear plant .

1220,"Nicosia, Cyprus (CNN) -- Two top Cyprus officials resigned Monday after an explosion at a naval base killed at least 12 people in the island nation, state radio reported. Defense Minister Costas Papacostas and National Guard Chief Petros Tsalikides resigned, Cyprus state radio said. About 50 people were wounded in the blast at the Evangelos Florakis Naval Base at Zygi, the station said. Among the dead are five firefighters and two sailors. A grass fire spread to the base, setting dozens of crates of gunpowder on fire and causing the blast, the station said. Greece's defense ministry announced Monday that it was sending a C-27 aircraft and military experts to help authorities with their investigation of the blast. The explosion knocked out power at the neighboring Vasilikos Power Station, the nation's largest electricity plant, the power company said. State radio reported that 40% of the island was without power and government officials were making arrangements for generators to be shipped into the country. In the meantime, the nation's other two power stations were ""trying to meet the demand,"" said Costas Gavrielides, a spokesman for the country's electricity authority. Roads leading to the base have been blocked off, with no one allowed to enter or leave, the news agency said. ""Today is a black day for the Cypriot democracy and its people because of the loss of lives of our compatriots and injuries,"" said President Demetris Christofias.

1222,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A bomb flattened a hotel Sunday in southwest Pakistan, killing at least 12 people, police said. The attack came hours after five rockets fired at a paramilitary training camp in the country's tribal region killed three people, a paramilitary spokesman said. The incidents took place as Pakistan celebrate its Independence Day. The bomb was planted inside a hotel in Dera Allah Yar, a town in Balochistan province, said police official Israr Umrani. Dozens of people were inside the hotel when the blast took place, Umrani said. In addition to those killed, another 14 were wounded. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Balochistan is Pakistan's largest province but also its poorest and most sparsely populated. In recent years, the province has been plagued by sectarian violence and separatist Baluch militant groups who demand political autonomy and a greater share of profits from the province's natural resources. The earlier attack Sunday took place at the Tochi Scouts camp at Miranshah in North Waziristan. The rockets struck while the paramilitary group was preparing for an Independence Day parade, said Maj. Niaz Khan. In addition to those killed, 25 people were wounded, Khan said. The Tochi Scouts are a federally-controlled paramilitary force that has been primarily recruited from Pakistan's tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. Pakistan celebrates its independence every year on August 14, the day it was made an independent country based on borders created by the British as they ended their colonial rule in India.

1223,"(CNN) -- Survivors of a deadly earthquake-triggered tsunami which hit the Samoan islands Tuesday have described how they watched the inrushing sea swallow up coastal towns and villages leaving devastation in its wake. iReporter Alden Tagarino captured this image of the damage caused by the tsunami in Pago Pago. At least 111 people are confirmed killed in Samoa, neighboring American Samoa and Tonga. But officials in the Polynesia region have expressed fears the toll will rise as rescue workers struggle to reach outlying villages submerged and flattened by the wave. American Samoa resident Frances Faumatu told CNN she had fled to Aoloau, the highest village on the island, as the earthquake shook her house. ""All of a sudden we heard on the radio everybody had to run for safety,"" she said. ""Right after the quake, the tsunami came."" Faumatu and others stayed on the mountain for two or three hours until the warning was lifted, watching as the sea swallowed Pago Pago, the island's capital, and then receded. At least 22 people are confirmed dead in the U.S. island territory. Cars, debris, and parts of buildings were randomly strewn over the landscape where the powerful waters dropped them.  See iReporter images of the aftermath » . But in some cases, the sea left nothing behind. ""Other villages were taken to the ocean,"" Faumatu said. ""I can't even compare the image. It's one thing to see a photo or footage, but just to be there in person is pretty dramatic,"" Maneafaiga T. Lagafuaina told CNN Wednesday. ""American Samoa itself is experiencing a great loss."" The 8.0-magnitude quake hit the small cluster of Samoan islands in the South Pacific early Tuesday. In Samoa, the death toll stands at 82, according to government minister Maulolo Tavita. But he said he feared the number of causalities would continue to rise. Around 220,000 people live on the two main islands which make up the nation of Samoa. The population of American Samoa is about 66,000.  See a map of the affected region » . Salamo Laumoli, director of health services at the LBJ Tropical Medical Center in Pago Pago, said he feared more fatalities would turn up as rescue workers strived to access parts of the island severed by damaged infrastructure. ""I thought it was the end of the world,"" said Laumoli. ""I have never felt an earthquake like that before."" Patients at the hospital were briefly moved to higher ground, but they were soon brought back and the hospital is operating, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency said. The airport in the capital of Pago Pago was also operational and being used for emergency flights, FEMA said. A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 cargo plane was scheduled to land Wednesday around noon Eastern time, which coincides with sunrise in the Pacific U.S. protectorate, said Craig Fugate, FEMA administrator. A second C-130 was scheduled to land around 5 p.m. ET. ""The wave came onshore and washed out people's homes,"" said Cinta Brown, an American Samoa homeland security official working at the island's emergency operations center. The same happened on the hard-hit east and west sides of American Samoa, said Brown, who was standing in a parking lot when her sport utility vehicle began rocking left and right. She said she could hear the rattling of metal of a large chain-link fence around the lot. ""It shakes you because you know something else is coming,"" she said. The British Foreign Office said one of the dead in American Samoa was a British national, but no other details were provided. In Tonga, Lord Tuita, the acting prime minister, said at least seven people had been confirmed dead on the northern island of Niuatoputapu. Three others were missing and four people were being treated for serious injuries, he said. ""The hospital on the island is reported to have suffered major damage; telephone communications has been cut as a result of damage to equipment and facilities on the island; homes and government buildings have been destroyed; the airport runway has been severely damaged making it impossible for any fixed wing aircraft to land,"" a statement from the Tongan prime minister's office said.

The walls of water were so strong that they twisted concrete beams and mangled cars.  See an explainer on tsunamis » . Laumoli said people in outlying villages on one end of the main American Samoa island had been cut off because the connecting bridge was washed away.  Listen to Laumoli speak about the impact of the quake and tsunami » . American Samoa Gov. Togiola Tulafono, speaking from Hawaii, said Tuesday's quake ranked ""right up there with some of the worst"" disasters on the island. He said he had spoken to the military about mobilizing reserve forces for assistance. Tulafono was on his way back home from Hawaii on Tuesday night on one of two U.S. Coast Guard transport planes delivering aid. He told reporters Tuesday it had been hard being away from home as the disaster unfolded. It was a time, he said, for families to be together.  Watch American Samoa governor discuss tsunami » . President Obama declared American Samoa a major disaster area, ordering federal aid to supplement local efforts. ""We keep the many people who have been touched by this tragedy in our thoughts and in our prayers,"" he said. A U.S. Defense Department official said 75 members of the Hawaii National Guard were ordered to American Samoa to begin assisting with medical relief, search and rescue and providing communications capabilities on the island. The unit will bring enough supplies to sustain themselves for 96 hours and its expected more aid from the military could begin flowing in, the official said. The Coast Guard is transporting more than 20 officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to American Samoa, said John Hamill, external affairs officer for FEMA in Oakland, California. The FEMA team will include a variety of debris experts, housing experts, members of the Corps of Engineers, and other disaster relief specialists, Hamill said. The quake generated three separate tsunami waves, the largest measuring 5.1 feet from sea level height, said Vindell Hsu, a geophysicist with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Preliminary data had originally reported a larger tsunami.

1224,"Indianapolis, Indiana (CNN) -- The Indiana State Fair reopened Monday with a public memorial service for five people killed when a concert stage collapsed during a storm. The fairgrounds were closed Saturday night following the accident, which occurred shortly before the country music duo Sugarland was to take the stage before an audience of about 12,000. ""While we will never forget this horrific event and those who perished, may we Hoosiers find the courage to unify, rebuild and re-emerge with a stronger heart,"" said Indiana first lady Cheri Daniels, who attended Saturday's concert and was one of several speakers at Monday's ceremony. Audience members at the service honored victims with a moment of silence and later sang ""Amazing Grace."" Officials Monday were focusing on grieving with victims and beginning repairs to get the fair back underway, Gov. Mitch Daniels told CNN. ""Our first instinct in Indiana is not to go rushing around, looking for scapegoats. It's to take care of business, take care of those who've been hurt and then, of course ... study to see if something could have done better and learn any necessary lessons,"" he said. On Sunday he described the stage's collapse as a ""freakish accident."" ""I'm not saying that we're not going to find many things that could have been done differently,"" Daniels told CNN Monday. ""I'm only saying that I know the people who run this operation. They think safety all the time, and I know that their hearts are broken that, in this case, this event took place as it did."" Investigators on Sunday sifted through debris of the stage, trying to determine what caused the accident that also injured at least 40 people, authorities said. Metal scaffolding fell onto the ""Sugarpit,"" a section usually occupied by Sugarland's most ardent fans, about four minutes after authorities took the stage to warn the crowd to seek shelter, according to a timeline of events released by investigators Sunday. Forecasters had warned heavy rain and strong winds would hit the fair nearly two hours before the storm moved through Saturday. The National Weather Service estimated winds at 60 to 70 mph. Video shows the blue canvas top fraying and flapping just seconds before the steel scaffolding gave way, sending a heavy bank of stage lights and metal onto fans closest to the outdoor stage. The Atlanta-based Sugarland group -- along with its opening act, Sara Bareilles -- canceled their scheduled performance Sunday at the Iowa State Fair. According to the fair's website, ""aside from coping with the magnitude of the accident, the ongoing investigation prevents the band from getting what may remain of their stage equipment."" Jennifer Nettles, one half of the Sugarland duo, posted a statement on the group's website Sunday, saying ""there are no words to process a moment of this magnitude and gravity."" ""There are only prayers for peace in the hearts of the bereft, and prayers of thanksgiving for those who were spared or safe. A piece of our heart is left in that grandstand,"" Nettles said. Bareilles, who had just finished her performance when the collapse occurred, tweeted Sunday she was ""still thinking of all those affected."" On her website, she wrote: ""The accident at the Indiana State Fair felt like a bad dream. The weather changed in a matter of minutes and the stage collapsed in a matter of seconds. "" She called the emergency response ""incredibly quick."" While most of the injured were treated and released from Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital, nine patients were admitted and were still being treated Sunday afternoon, the hospital said. Three children remained at Riley Hospital for Children, the hospital said. ""We're all very much in mourning of the loss of the victims, and we are praying with their families,"" Cindy Hoye, the fair's executive director said. The Marion County, Indiana, coroner identified the three women and two men who died as: Tammy Vandam, 42, of Wanatah, Indiana; Glenn Goodrich, 49, of Indianapolis; Alina Bigjohny, 23, of Fort Wayne, Indiana; Christina Santiago, 29, of Chicago; and Nathan Byrd, 51, of Indianapolis. Vandam, Goodrich, Bigjohny and Santiago were dead at the scene, while Byrd died later at the hospital, the coroner said. Friends, colleagues and family gathered Sunday to remember Santiago at Chicago's Howard Brown Health Center, a health care organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, where she worked. ""We have lost a fierce warrior, an amazing activist,"" said Rosa Yadira Ortiz, board president for Amigas Latinos, a group for lesbian Hispanics in Chicago that Santiago was involved in. ""She really brought us all together."" The families of two of those hospitalized released brief statements Sunday, each asking for prayers and privacy. ""Jenny Haskell, a 22-year-old Ball State senior, is very critical at this time,"" her family said. A fifth-grader, identified only as Jade, is in critical condition, according to her family. Allison Hoehn, a concertgoer, said many attendees rushed to those trapped after the stage crumbled. ""We tried to get down to help, but no one was moving,"" Hoehn said. ""The storm came on so fast and the stage just snapped like a toothpick."" Spectators grabbed parts of their seats to assemble makeshift stretchers, she said. ""Everyone rushed to help, and we saw people searching and pulling people out,"" Hoehn said. Dust swirled just before a gust of wind rushed in and the stage crashed down, concertgoer Jenna Gioe told CNN Monday. ""It was absolute pandemonium"" as crowds rushed to get out of the grandstand, she said. Days after the stage collapse, Gioe said she was still struggling to understand the tragic turn of events. ""It's absolutely baffling ... What actually happened, it's beyond all of us,"" she said. CNN's Alan Duke, Chelsea J.

1225,"(CNN) -- Concertgoers at the Indiana State Fair panicked and fled in the immediate aftermath of the concert stage collapse. But just as quickly, they returned, offering what they could during the moments that mattered. ""I'm a nurse. I'm a doctor. I'm a trained EMS responder,"" they said, according to Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, whose voice broke with emotion as he recalled the extraordinary efforts of ordinary people. ""The individual Hoosiers ran to the trouble, not from the trouble,"" he said, using the name for Indiana residents. ""It's the character that we associate with our state. People don't have to be paid to do it."" The stage collapse at the Indiana State Fair Saturday night killed five people and injured 40 others. Video showed the blue canvas top fraying and flapping just seconds before the steel scaffolding gave way, sending a heavy bank of stage lights and metal onto fans closest to the outdoor stage. Ivan Gratz, a professional videographer, witnessed the event and filmed what happened after the collapse. ""Everybody ran away from the stage,"" he said. ""And then as soon as the stage, like it was stable on the ground, everyone turned around and they ran back. And that's what was incredible in the pictures where you see the people grab a hold of the stage and they're lifting it up."" ""Just amazing,"" said Gratz. Allison Hoehn, another concertgoer, said that many attendees rushed to help those trapped after the stage crumbled. ""We tried to get down to help, but no one was moving,"" Hoehn said. ""The storm came on so fast and the stage just snapped like a toothpick."" Spectators grabbed parts of their seats to assemble makeshift stretchers, Hoehn said. ""Everyone rushed to help, and we saw people searching and pulling people out,"" she said. ""(I) saw five people go away on stretchers. It was amazing how many people ran in to try to lift the scaffolding."" Video broadcast by CNN affiliate WISH showed people heaving heavy equipment and working with great care as they moved one of the injured. Some concertgoers supported the scaffolding as others pointed, appearing to direct the response. ""It was a tough scene. I've been a photographer for 30 years but to see something like this ... it was (a) pretty tough situation for a lot of people,"" said Gratz.","Video of the scene show concertgoers returning to help .

1226,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Bobby Maurice Tillman, the Georgia teen stomped to death outside a home where a party was being held, died from a lacerated heart, Douglas County Coroner Randy Daniel told CNN Tuesday. He said the 18-year-old likely suffered a break in a rib bone, which in turn punctured his heart. If the young man had not been stomped, he probably would not have been injured in that way and would have survived the beating, Daniel added. Police say Horace Damon Coleman, 19, Emanuel Benjamin Boykins, 18, Quantez Devonta Mallory, 18, and Tracen Franklin, 19, stomped and beat Tillman outside a party in metro Atlanta over the weekend. The four men are facing felony murder charges. Douglas County Sheriff Phil Miller has said the attack happened after some girls got into a fight, and one of them hit a boy. That boy, according to Miller, said he wasn't going to ""hit a girl,"" but the next guy who came by was going to get ""beat down."" Tillman walked by. Miller said the victim was a ""little guy, 18 years old, 5-foot-6, weighed 125 pounds."" ""He was small in stature, but ... his spirit and his strength were bigger to me than this world,"" Tillman's mother, Monique Rivarde, told CNN Tuesday. ""My son was bullied by four cowards."" No drugs or alcohol were found at the scene, according to the sheriff, who said he doesn't expect any more charges in the case.

1227,"(CNN) -- This is a tale of two cities tied together by two tornadoes of the most wicked order, the apocalyptic EF-5 -- and by acts of charity that followed. It demonstrates how one good turn -- or town -- deserves another. First, the town of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, got hit by a twister on April 27, killing 41. So, like many others across the country, the residents in and around Joplin, Missouri, dispatched volunteers and relief goods to the Alabama community. Melodie Schultz of Joplin even participated in a fund-raiser. ""I got involved just by seeing that they needed the help in Tuscaloosa, and a friend of mine started just a group of us: 'Joplin Helping Tuscaloosa, Alabama,' "" Schultz told CNN. Pastor Matt Harenza of Carterville Christian Church in Carthage, Missouri, just 16 miles from Joplin, donated manpower to the Tuscaloosa wreckage. ""When the tornado happened in Tuscaloosa, a sister church there in Nashville (Tennessee) called and asked if we could bring our team to Tuscaloosa and help out,"" said Harenza. ""So we got our team and got our tools and stuff and went down there to help out."" Then, a month later, fortunes between the Tuscaloosa and Joplin were reversed. The single deadliest U.S. twister since modern record-keeping began in 1950 ripped through Joplin, killing 142 persons. It, too, was an EF-5. So the people of Tuscaloosa and elsewhere in Alabama returned Joplin's favor. A truckload of water, diapers, baby food and other relief materials arrived Saturday for the people of Joplin, and the goods were being stored in a warehouse at Harenza's church because Joplin is too obliterated to house the supplies. The donations were delivered courtesy of the relief group Toomer's for Tuscaloosa and Ashley Furniture HomeStore of Birmingham, Alabama, said Chris Fields, a spokesman for Toomer's. ""Sunday afternoon, we saw on the Weather Channel that there was a storm that was about to hit Joplin, and we wondered why we recognized that name so well,"" Fields said. ""We realized why we recognized it,"" he said. Joplin residents ""sent down a giant truck of aid for the residents of Tuscaloosa,"" he said. So, the residents of Tuscaloosa and other parts of Alabama donated enough goods to fill two 53-foot trucks and a 26-foot truck, Fields said. The 26-foot truck, with a Toomer's banner saying ""Stuff-The-Truck. Joplin, Mo bound,"" was eventually diverted to another tornado-wracked community in Arkansas, but the two bigger trucks continued on their mission to provide relief to Joplin, Fields said. Fields was amazed at the outpouring of support for Joplin, with donations arriving by the pickup load, leaving him in tears, he said. ""These people have been through it and they know exactly what to bring,"" from flashlights to batteries to baby bottles, Fields said of Tuscaloosa residents' donations. ""It is part of our healing process to help someone who has been through the exact same thing that we had been through. That's why so many people stepped up to the plate,"" Field said. ""This movement is so large, so many people stepping up as individuals taking care of their neighbors, it's a beautiful, beautiful thing to happen in this country,"" Fields added. For Schultz's part, she was volunteering for a Tuscaloosa fund-raiser in Joplin on the very day that the tornado ripped through her Missouri town, she said. In dramatic fashion, she raised money by doing mini-photo shoots and managed to do 20 of them before disaster struck Sunday, she said. ""We managed to make it to safety probably five or 10 minutes before the tornado hit,"" Schultz said. Tuscaloosa's mutual humanitarianism moved her, she said. ""They just want to do whatever they can to help us, which is amazing to me. They've gone through the exact same thing, not even a month ago, and are so willing to send truckloads of food and anything that we need down here, and they're happy to do it,"" Schultz said. ""They've got our backs, and they're completely supportive."" Harenza, the pastor, said seeing the truckload of donations from Tuscaloosa was ""an emotional thing."" Similar trucks from around the country arrived in Tuscaloosa during his volunteer efforts there last month, he said. ""You just go, 'Wow, people care about people,' and this tragedy almost pulls us together as a nation,"" Harenza said. Said Fields: ""It's supernatural what has happened here as far as I'm concerned."" CNN's Chris Turner and Emily Robards contributed to this report.","A tornado hits Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in April .

1228,"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Authorities in Northern Ireland have arrested a tenth person in connection with the death of a police officer in a car bombing last April, police said Wednesday. A 23-year-old woman was arrested in Omagh by detectives probing the death of Constable Ronan Kerr ""and associated incidents,"" the Police Service of Northern Ireland said. Five men were arrested Tuesday. Kerr died April 2 when an explosive device detonated under a car in the Highfield Close area of Omagh.  The 25-year-old had only recently joined the service, Assistant Chief Constable Drew Harris said at the time. ""Our determination to pursue every possible line of enquiry remains undiminished,"" Detective Superintendent Raymond Murray said Tuesday. Of the 10 people arrested, only one has been charged in connection with the investigation -- though not with the killing.  A 33-year-old man from Omagh was charged after arms and explosives were found in Coalisland, County Tyrone. Northern Ireland was racked by violence between pro-Irish and pro-British forces over a period of three decades. About 3,500 people were killed before a power-sharing deal known as the Good Friday Agreement was reached in 1998. In August of that year, Omagh was the scene of the conflict's most deadly terrorist attack, in which a car bombing by the paramilitary splinter group Real IRA killed 29 people. Journalist Peter Taggart contributed to this report.","Of 10 people arrested, only one has been charged in connection with the investigation so far .

1229,"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fresh explosions rang out early Tuesday near Tripoli, hours after South African President Jacob Zuma held talks with Moammar Gadhafi and signalled he was ready to accept an African Union plan for a cease-fire. Around 12:45 a.m. Tuesday, a pair of large blasts were heard about five minutes apart, as jets flew over the capital of Tripoli. A Libyan government official said the first strike hit Abu Sita, a former military turned construction site about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the city center. There was no immediate indication of where the second explosion occurred. Nor was there an immediate response from NATO, which has conducted regular strikes as part of its stated mission to halt Libyan leader Gadhafi's forces from killing innocent civilians. Hours before the blasts, Zuma emerged from a meeting with the longtime Libyan strongman convinced that Gadhafi was ready for an end to hostilities, including such airstrikes and the ongoing fight with the Benghazi-based opposition movement. But he gave no indication that Gadhafi was prepared to step aside, as rebel leaders have insisted is their primary demand. ""Brother leader took the position today that he is ready to implement the decision of the AU (that) there must be a cease-fire,"" Zuma told a scrum of reporters on the tarmac at Tripoli's Mitiga International Airport before boarding a jet. ""The view is that that must include -- bombing by NATO must also come to an end,"" he said in the news conference, which was broadcast on Libyan state television. Zuma added that Gadhafi said any cease-fire must apply to all parties, ""but also, he makes the point that: Let the Libyan people be given a chance to talk among themselves. And therefore, he's ready to implement the road map of the AU."" Unlike some other world leaders, Zuma has not called for the longtime Libyan leader to step down. Neither has Zuma's African National Congress party nor the African Union, which he was representing and which Gadhafi once led. In fact, the AU has criticized the NATO airstrikes. In April, Zuma led an AU delegation to Tripoli, where hopes were raised briefly when it was announced that Gadhafi had agreed, in principle, to the African Union's ""road map"" proposal for peace. But Gadhafi continued his attacks and the Libyan opposition rejected the proposal because it did not meet its demand that he give up the power he has held for 42 years. A government official said Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi also attended Monday's meeting. Baghdadi greeted Zuma upon his arrival at the airport, where dozens of Gadhafi supporters carried posters, some of which said, ""May the leader be victorious"" and ""Thanks for great Africa."" The African Union has helped mediate peace talks before, including ones in Kenya and Zimbabwe that left the ruling powers in control. It was not clear whether Zuma used the opportunity to press Gadhafi for information on the whereabouts of South African freelance photographer Anton Hammerl. Hammerl has been missing in Libya since April and is believed dead. South Africa has said it got assurances from Libya that the journalist was alive. But a Libyan government spokesman has said his whereabouts were unknown. ""We never had him with us at any stage,"" spokesman Musa Ibrahim has said. The meeting came as Gadhafi's grip on power appeared to continue to loosen. Eight generals from his army have defected to Italy, the Italian Foreign Ministry told CNN Monday. The generals were accompanied by more than 100 Libyan soldiers, a senior Italian official with firsthand knowledge of, and responsibility for, the operation said. The Libyans crossed their country's border into Tunisia, where they were met by Italian intelligence agents, the official said. Italy announced Monday that it will open a consulate Tuesday in the rebel-held eastern city of Benghazi. Also Monday, the first locally based television station to operate in Libya since the start of the revolution was to begin broadcasting from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. The station was founded by Momammed Nabus, who later was one of five journalists killed in the conflict. ""Gadhafi forces assassinated him for highlighting to the rest of the world the atrocities committed by the Gadhafi regime,"" said Zuheir Al-Barasi, who was to open the station's broadcast from the city's courthouse. In recent weeks, Gadhafi has been seen in public only rarely as NATO has stepped up attacks against his sprawling Bab el-Azizia compound. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday that Gadhafi's ""reign of terror is coming to an end."" ""He is increasingly isolated at home and abroad,"" Rasmussen said during a speech in Bulgaria. ""Even those closest to him are departing, defecting or deserting."" Rasmussen also said NATO has made ""significant progress"" in its Libya operation. NATO said Monday it has conducted 3,385 strike sorties in Libya since March. ""We have seriously degraded Gadhafi's ability to kill his own people,"" Rasmussen said in his speech. ""We have prevented more massacres in Misrata and elsewhere across the country, and we are saving lives every day."" The NATO-led bombing campaign began in March after the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of any means necessary -- short of occupation -- to protect civilians from attacks by Gadhafi's forces. On Sunday, Libyan opposition forces continued to fend off attacks near the rebel-held port city of Misrata. But rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil said over the weekend that the opposition movement is running out of money even as it has achieved key victories militarily and diplomatically. ""We are going through a financial crisis,"" said Jalil, chairman of the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council. In a speech in Geneva, Switzerland, the United Nations' top human rights official noted Monday ""the brutality and magnitude of measures"" taken by the Libyan government. The government's actions have been ""shocking,"" United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said, criticizing the ""outright disregard for basic human rights.""

1230,"(CNN) -- A series of four strong earthquakes spanning just over an hour struck the Philippines' Moro Gulf on Saturday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Three of the four earthquakes had magnitudes between 7.3 and 7.6; the other came in at a 5.4 magnitude. The first quake struck at 6:08 a.m. (6:08 p.m. ET Friday) and the fourth hit at 7:15 a.m. The last quake ran the deepest at 616 (382 miles) kilometers. The epicenters of the quakes were about 100 kilometers (62 miles) off the coastal city of Cotabato and roughly 950 kilometers (590 miles) southeast of Manila. No tsunami warning was immediately issued for any of the quakes. There were no reports of damage, said Rona Faeldin of the Philippines Coast Guard.

1231,"(CNN) -- An Irish man known as ""The Naked Adventurer"" was rescued off the coast of Western Australia during a failed attempt to row across the Indian Ocean. Keith Whelan -- whose website says he wants to become the first Irish person to row across the ocean -- was hit by a wave Monday and ""sustained a large laceration,"" said Tracey Jiggins of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. ""He was rescued 206 kilometers (128 miles) off the shore northwest of Geraldton,"" Jiggins said Tuesday. She said a merchant ship picked up Whelan, who was en route to Bunbury in Western Australia on Tuesday. ""His injuries are not life threatening, so (he) will remain on the ship until it docks at Bunbury tomorrow afternoon,"" Jiggins said. A statement on Whelan's website -- TheNakedAdventurer.com -- says Whelan was asleep Monday night when the force of the wave threw him across the boat's inner cabin. ""Keith was able to stop the bleeding himself and ... decided to seek help at first light,"" the statement said. When asked why he decided to attempt the 6,000-kilometer (3,728-mile) journey from Western Australia to Mauritius, Whelan said on his site, ""I am a risk taker and risking your life to achieve a dream is the biggest risk you can take. Some might say it's foolish but to my mind it is only foolish if you don't know the risks and you don't prepare for them and train for every possible scenario."" Whelan is also raising money for Keep a Child Alive, which helps provide life-saving treatment, care and support to children and families in Africa and India affected by HIV/AIDS, according to the website. The site also said Whelan embarked on the solo challenge in the buff. ""Having gotten into a rowing boat for the first time only a year or so beforehand, he will spend 110 days alone at sea, facing 50 foot swells, hurricane force winds and unrelenting sunshine ... and he'll be naked,"" it said. Why naked? ""As the Ocean is a very salty environment, clothing tends to become encrusted with salt,"" Whelan said on the site. ""I will have no means of cleaning this from any clothing at sea, so wearing this clothing when full of salt would lead to severe salt sores on my body which is why I will be naked for most of the journey."" Jiggins said she was not sure whether Whelan was found naked, ""nor do I care."" CNN's Holly Yan contributed to this report.","Keith Whelan is hit by a wave and suffers a ""large laceration""

1232,"(CNN) -- Gunfire and shelling rang out across Syria's coastal city of Latakia early Tuesday amid reports of Palestinian refugees fleeing a restive and impoverished enclave there. At least five people died on Tuesday, according to a resident who requested anonymity for safety reasons, and the city remained under siege amid a military offensive against protesters. The humanitarian situation deteriorated amid the government's offensive in the city. Shops and bakeries were closed, and at least two mosques were damaged. The gunfire could be heard ""all night and morning,"" the witness said. ""This is the fourth day that we do not have electricity or water. Landline phone connections have been down most of the day,"" he said by satellite phone. Snipers perched atop various locations in the city's al-Ramel neighborhood, the site of a Palestinian refugee camp, he said. Demonstrations have taken place in the Ramel area every day since the Syrian uprising began five months ago, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The LCC, a network of opposition activists, said the area's lack of basic urban services could be a reason why those in Ramel are angry at the Syrian government. ""The tragedy of (Ramel) has not stopped since yesterday,"" the LCC said in a statement Tuesday. The refugee camp normally holds 10,000 people, but reports have surfaced of many people fleeing violence there. The resident said a large portion of the Ramel area has been evacuated. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which provides assistance for Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, has expressed alarm over reports of heavy gunfire from Syrian security forces into the refugee camp and other areas. ""Reports from various sources indicate deaths and casualties among the Palestinian refugee population, although poor communications make it impossible to confirm the exact number of dead and injured,"" it said in its latest statement. Christopher Gunness, UNRWA spokesman, said refugees in Latakia had been asked to leave by the Syrian security forces. He said some left on their own because they were afraid for their lives. ""We are asking the Syrian government for immediate access to the Palestinians, as their well-being is our responsibility,"" Gunness told CNN. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said security forces entered the city only to protect its residents from armed gangs. The Syrian government vehemently denied reports that more than 5,000 Palestinians fled the refugee camp in the area after it came under fire from Syrian security forces. It also reported Tuesday that reports of shelling by the navy on Ramel are ""completely untrue."" A video posted on YouTube Monday purportedly shows a dead girl who was shot in the eye as her father drove by a security checkpoint in Latakia. Rami Abdul-Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, said the girl and her parents were trying to flee in a car. The father was shot in the shoulder and the mother was lightly injured. Bloodshed in the country has persisted since a government crackdown on anti-government protesters started in mid-March. The LCC said at least 2,545 people have died. The vast majority were civilians, and 391 were security personnel, the LCC said. The strong security reaction to demonstrators calling for political changes has spurred outrage among world powers, like the United States, and among Syria's neighbors, such as Jordan and Turkey. CNN cannot independently verify opposition or government claims because Syria has restricted international journalists from reporting inside the country.

1233,"(CNN) -- The death toll from the devastating tornado that ripped through Joplin, Missouri, last month has risen to 155, a city spokeswoman said Monday. The previous death toll, reported on Friday, was 154. The most recent death was Edmon A. Cooper, Joplin city spokeswoman Lynn Onstot said. Cooper died from injuries sustained during the May 22 tornado, Onstot said. No other details were immediately available. The Joplin tornado was the deadliest single U.S. twister in more than 60 years, according to National Weather Service records. It left a 13-mile-long trail of destruction through the southwest Missouri city, stripping the bark from trees and smashing homes into unrecognizable rubble.","The previous death toll, reported on Friday, was 154 .

1234,"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Massive downpours in South Korea -- the heaviest rains in a century -- are blamed for 35 deaths, according to the country's Central Disaster Relief Agency. Heavy rain was still falling Thursday morning across parts of the country. It was raining in some areas around Seoul at a rate of two inches an hour (50 millimeters an hour) and was expected to continue Thursday. The most recent numbers released by the Central Disaster Relief Agency indicated that much of the death toll comes from landslides triggered by the rain.  In Chuncheon, 13 people were killed by landslides, while 15 were killed by the same phenomenon in Seoul.  Five people were still missing, the agency said. Five neighborhoods on the outskirts of Seoul were under evacuation orders. But officials were able to restore electricity to many thousands of homes that had lost power.  Earlier, there were 116,000 homes without power, said the agency.  Early Thursday, that number stood at 1,190. Earlier, the agency warned that hundreds of families had lost their homes. The weather caused major traffic disruptions across portions of the country as well. The Korea Meteorological Agency issued a special heavy rainfall alert for cities in the center of the country.  The forecast called for the downpour to continue at a rate of 60 millimeters (2.4 inches) per hour over the next day. South Korea typically experiences a rainy season during the summer.","NEW: Rain falling at a rate of 2 inches an hour in some areas .

1235,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Two more blasts struck Nigeria on Monday, bringing the total to five since President Goodluck Jonathan was inaugurated Sunday. One blast Monday was directed at a military patrol in Maiduguri, in northern Nigeria, military spokesman Mohammed Yerima said. No casualties were reported. The other was in Zaria, also in northern Nigeria. It was the second blast in Zaria in less than a day. On Sunday, an explosion struck a beer parlor in Zaria, wounding two people, National Emergency Management Agency spokesman Yushau Shauib said. There were no casualties reported in the bombings Monday. The other two blasts Sunday were at a market in Bauchi, east of Zaria, and a beer hall in Zuba, on the outskirts of the Nigerian capital of Abuja. In the Bauchi explosion, at least 13 people were killed and 20 were wounded, Shauib said. In the Zuba blast, two people were killed and 11 others were hospitalized, Shauib said. In recent weeks, the African nation has been rocked by a series of bombings thought to be engineered by Boko Haram, an Islamic group that has challenged Nigeria's government. Explosions in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno killed a few and wounded dozens in late April in the days leading up to the national governorship elections. Police described the attacks as attempts to intimidate voters who had picked Jonathan. Northern Muslims in some areas charged that the presidential election was rigged. Armed protesters in the region took to the streets chanting the name of former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, the main opposition front-runner. This is Jonathan's first full term. As vice president, he took over the presidency in May 2010 upon the death of then-President Umaru Yar'Adua, who had suffered from a heart condition.

1236,"(CNN) -- A man was killed by a grizzly bear Wednesday morning at Yellowstone National Park, according to the National Park Service. The visitor was hiking with his wife along the Wapiti Lake trail when he surprised a female bear with her cubs, the park service said. The bear attacked and fatally wounded the man in an attempt to defend her cubs. A group of nearby hikers called police after they heard the victim's wife crying for help. The name of the victim is being withheld pending notification of family members. There have been no reports of bear encounters along or near the Wapiti Lake trail this season, park spokesman Al Nash said in the statement. A bear warning sign was posted at the head of the trail because of known bear activity along access points. All trails and back-country campsites have been closed until further notice. Park rangers are working to clear the area of all back-country users. ""It is extremely unfortunate that this couple's trip into the Yellowstone backcountry has ended in tragedy,"" said Dan Wenk, superintendent of Yellowstone National Park. ""Our heart goes out to the family and friends of the victim as they work to cope with their loss."" This is the first bear-caused human fatality in Yellowstone since 1986, Nash said. Bear attacks are extremely rare. No visitors were injured by bears in the park in 2010. Park visitors are advised to hike in groups of three or more people and to be alert for bears and make noise in blind spots. It is not known if the victim or his wife was carrying bear pepper spray at the time of the incident. Bear pepper spray has been effective in stopping aggressive bears.","A man, traveling with his wife in Yellowstone, was killed by a grizzly .

1237,"(CNN) -- Federal officials are investigating how firecrackers got into a Southwest Airlines plane scheduled to leave Las Vegas on  Tuesday. Southwest Airlines Flight 2408 was leaving Las Vegas McCarran International Airport and was headed to Kansas City, Missouri. The flight was delayed for an hour when a flight attendant found a plastic bag with firecrackers underneath a seat, said Ashley Dillon, an airline spokeswoman. Passengers deplaned. After an inspection that included re-screening luggage, the Transportation Security Administration declared the plane safe and allowed passengers to re-board.

1238,"(CNN) -- Near Yosemite National Park's beautiful Mist Trail, a young man lost his footing, slipping close to the edge of a waterfall. A female companion frantically grabbed for him, but stumbled. Another hiker followed and the three were swept over the powerful 317-foot Vernal Fall, joining a deadly trend at the park this year. Authorities at Yosemite National Park are still searching for two of the bodies from that deadly July accident. And others are searching for answers to explain the recent rash of deaths at the national park in California. This year, 16 people have died from incidents at Yosemite, rangers say. That is about twice as usual. While five visitors have died this year from natural causes, the others were accidental and often entirely preventable. Rangers say some visitors take part in dangerous practices such as hiking treacherous trails in flip-flops, or climbing over safety rails to get better pictures or swimming in waters that are perilously close to waterfalls. Witnesses said the three hikers who were swept over the waterfall in July had climbed over a safety rail. ""We don't station a ranger in every possible dangerous place that's out there,"" said Kari Cobb, a park ranger. ""People have to come here and realize that Yosemite is nature and it is a very wild place."" Bill Ott, a hiker, says he has seen people swimming in dangerous waters. ""We saw a number of people wading just steps from going into the faster water. It's crazy. Just crazy,"" he said. Visitor Tim Timmerman says he has a plan to keep his family safe. ""We aren't worried because we think if you stay where you're supposed to stay, you're safe and it's exciting,"" Timmerman said. ""It'll be a little scary for them but it's not dangerous if you do what you're supposed to do,""","This year, 16 people have died at Yosemite National Park .

1239,"(CNN) -- One of the worst wildfires in Arizona history grew by 40,000 acres Monday, forcing the evacuation of thousands as crews battled heavy winds in trying to prevent the 30-mile line from advancing further, officials said. The ""Wallow Fire,"" as the blaze is known, has scorched 233,522 acres as of Monday evening -- up more than 21% from the 192,746 acres reported that morning -- said Terri Wildermuth, a spokeswoman for the Incident Management Team that is overseeing firefighting efforts. ""We had a hard day today,"" Joe Reinarz, an incident commander, told those attending a town hall meeting in Greer, Arizona, on Monday evening. ""I don't know exactly where that fire is at this moment, because it is moving so fast."" The eastern Arizona wildfire, which began May 29, has forced the closure of the Apache National Forest and prompted the evacuation of about 3,000 people, said Mark Weldon of the Arizona Red Cross. Some 2,000 of those are in Alpine, about 700 are in Greer, 200 to 300 are in Nutrioso, and fewer than 100 are in Sunrise. The National Weather Service instituted a ""red flag warning,"" which means weather conditions are ripe for wildfires, for much of the northern half of the state. In eastern Arizona, southwest winds blew 25 to 28 mph through the region Monday with nighttime gusts forecast to blow as strong as 40 mph. Wind speeds are expected to slow somewhat but still be strong in the coming days, the weather service said, with daytime temperatures in the most affected regions forecast in the mid-60s. ""Tomorrow, (the wind) is supposed to pick back up all through Thursday,"" said Reinarz. ""We've got two or three days ahead ... that will try all of us."" The U.S. Forest Service said the fire is the fourth largest in Arizona's history, but Brad Pitassi of the incident management team said it is the third largest. While there have been no significant injuries so far, officials and area residents complained of heavy smoke that has blanketed the area like fog. ""To me, it feels like I'm suffocating,"" Deanna Davis told CNN affiliate KTVK. ""Smoke just sits in this valley and it sucks the air right out of you."" Davis, who manages Davis True Value Hardware store in Springerville, Arizona, said the fire and resulting smoke had forced a run on her store from customers looking to buy face masks. Among the evacuees was Jessie Walker, who along with his wife, Holly, abandoned the house he built in Nutrioso with his own hands to escape the approaching fire, according to Phoenix-based CNN affiliate KNXV. ""What a person don't realize is is how hard it is to face something like that,"" Walker told KNXV. ""You think you're prepared for it, you think you're mentally prepared for it, physically prepared for it. You're not. ""It's hard,"" Walker said, fighting back tears. The Walkers took as many of their possessions as they could even though there wasn't enough time to pack. Those belongings are now stored in a trailer out of harm's way. Walker said he has a brother who stayed behind. ""He wants to fight for what's his and I don't blame him,"" Walker said. The fire has bedeviled fire crews with its unpredictable path, thanks to wind gusts that have carried burning embers up to three miles.  Apache County Deputy Chief Sheriff Brannon Eagar on Monday evening urged people in the area, even if they haven't been ordered to evacuate yet, to get ready to leave. ""They can't predict how fast it's going to go,"" Eagar said at the town hall event in Greer. ""So make sure, please, you get ready. ""If I can convince anybody, please go. It'll make your life so much easier,"" he added. ""This thing is huge."" CNN's Ben Smith, Chelsea J. Carter, Phil Gast and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","NEW: A fire official says the next 2 to 3 days will likely continue to be difficult .

1240,"Beijing (CNN) -- Explosions at three government facilities in eastern China Thursday left two people dead, including the alleged perpetrator, the country's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. At least six people were injured in the blasts, which occured within a half hour of each other, local officials told CNN. ""A car bomb went off at 9:18 a.m. in the parking lot of the Fuzhou city prosecutor's office, followed by a blast at 9:20 a.m. at the Linchuan district government building and another car bomb at 9:45 a.m. near the local drug administration building,"" said Zhang Baoyun, a spokesman for the government of Jiangxi province, where Fuzhou is located. One body was found in the district government building and another person died in the hospital, Zhang added. Xinhua, citing police sources, reported that one of the people who died in the blast was the man suspected of setting off the explosives.  The man was identified as Qian Mingqi, 52, an unemployed resident of the area. Earlier, Xinhua said a disgruntled local peasant farmer had set off the bombs because of an ongoing lawsuit. On the Weibo page allegedly belonging to Qian, the bio line reads: ""I am physically and mentally normal, and have no criminal record or history of illegal petitions. When my new house was illegally torn down, it caused me huge financial loss. After a futile ten years of appealing for justice, I am forced to take a path I don't want to."" Weibo, the country's most popular microblogging service, is the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Photos from the scene show large crowds gathering near one of the blast sites with a thick plume of black smoke in the air. State-run Xinhua news agency quoted eyewitnesses as saying glass windows were shattered at the eight-story prosecutor's office building, while ambulances rushed in and out of the district government compound. Authorities are still investigating the explosions, while the injured -- including three in serious condition -- are at local hospitals, Zhang said. Fuzhou is a city of nearly 4 million residents some 1,600 kilometers (975 miles) south of Beijing. Last September, clashes between residents and officials in Yihuang, a county in Fuzhou, gained national attention. Three residents doused themselves with gasoline and burned themselves to protest the forced demolition of their homes by the local government. One died in the hospital, prompting widespread outrage that eventually forced provincial authorities to sack several local officials.

The Disaster Relief Fund will pay for removal of rubble and debris, temporary housing, rebuilding of roads, farms, airports and schools, and loans to small- and medium-sized businesses. Seeking to turn the nation's focus to the arduous task of rebuilding, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan last week invoked the imagery of his country's recovery from World War II. ""We must renew the determination that we had in the post-World War II reconstruction period, and we must tackle the task of reconstruction after this earthquake,"" he said. The devastation left behind by the March 11 earthquake is an opportunity to build ""a new, better future than before,"" said the prime minister, who was born in 1946 -- a year after the end of the war. Kan said the Japanese people ""stood up bravely and achieved a reconstruction that amazed the world."" The fund is only expected to cover a fraction of the total cost of recovery. The double disaster could cost Japan's government in excess of $305 billion, Deputy Finance Minister Mitsuru Sakurai told reporters last month. The monster 9.0-magnitude quake that rocked the country also spawned a tsunami, leaving nearly 28,000 people dead or missing. CNN's Steven Jiang contributed to this report.","Last month's monster quake spawned a tsunami and left nearly 28,000 people dead or missing .

1242,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Doctors have given a woman a new windpipe with tissue engineered from her own stem cells in what experts have hailed as a ""milestone in medicine."" Claudia Castillo, 30, suffered from tuberculosis for years. The breakthrough allowed Claudia Castillo, 30, to receive a new section of trachea -- an airway essential for breathing -- without the risk that her body would reject the transplant. Castillo was given the stem cell surgery, the controversial branch of medicine that some say could lead to human cloning, after suffering a severe lung collapse. The condition, caused by long-term tuberculosis left Castillo, a Colombian now living in Barcelona, unable to carry out simple domestic duties or care for her two children. The only conventional option was a major operation to remove her left lung, a risky procedure with a high mortality rate. Sound off: What do you think about this medical breakthrough? A team from the universities of Barcelona, Spain; Bristol, England; and Padua and Milan, Italy, decided instead to replace Castillo's lower trachea and bronchial tube to her left lung with a lab-grown airway. The operation, reported Wednesday in the British medical journal The Lancet, has been hailed as a major leap for medicine that could offer new hope for patients suffering from serious illness. ""Surgeons can now start to see and understand the very real potential for adult stem cells and tissue engineering to radically improve their ability to treat patients with serious diseases,"" said Martin Birchall, professor of surgery at the University of Bristol, who was part of the team that did the operation. ""We believe this success has proved that we are on the verge of a new age in surgical care."" To create the new windpipe, the team took a seven-centimeter (2.75-inch) segment of trachea from a 51-year-old who had died. Over a six-week period, the team then removed all the cells from the donor trachea, because those cells could lead to rejection of the organ after transplant. All that remained of the donor's stripped-down trachea was a matrix of collagen, a sort of scaffolding onto which the team then put Castillo's own stem cells -- along with cells taken from a healthy part of her trachea. Birchall had already taken Castillo's stem cells from her bone marrow and grown them into a large population in his Bristol lab.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain the procedure » . Four days after putting Castillo's stem cells into the donor trachea, the team was able to perform the transplant operation at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona. Castillo had no complications from the operation and was discharged from the hospital 10 days later. ""We are terribly excited by these results,"" said Paolo Macchiarini of the University of Barcelona, who performed the operation in June.  Watch Macchiarini describe the operation » . Macchiarini said just four days after the operation, the transplanted windpipe was ""almost indistinguishable"" from the patient's normal bronchi. After one month, he said, the blood vessels had successfully grown back. ""We think that this first experience represents a milestone in medicine and hope that it will unlock the door for a safe and recipient-tailored transplantation of the airway in adults and children,"" the authors said in their report. ""We hope that these future patients will no longer suffer the trauma of speech loss, severe shortness of breath and other limited clinical and social activities."" The doctors said Castillo is now able to care for her children and enjoy a normal quality of life. She can walk up two flights of stairs and occasionally even go out dancing at night. In a comment accompanying the Lancet report, Toshihiko Sato and Tatsuo Nakamura of Kyoto University in Japan said the operation should be highly regarded, but follow-ups from longer evaluation periods are needed to better evaluate the results.","Only a few windpipe, or trachea, transplants have ever been done.

1243,"(CNN) -- Sunday has long been a day for reflection in Joplin, Missouri, with residents flocking to churches and other places of worship for guidance, understanding and a sense of community. Now, several of those churches are gone, as are scores who might otherwise be going to them, thanks to a horrific tornado that ripped through the southwest Missouri city one week ago. That makes this Sunday especially significant, not to mention the subsequent days, as religious leaders try to offer meaning after such a senseless disaster. ""You could see ... the challenge they are going to face, as they preach funerals in the weeks to come,"" Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said after meeting faith-based leaders this week. ""It's enormous."" Nixon, along with President Barack Obama, will be among those attending a special memorial service at Missouri Southern State University for the 142 killed (as of Saturday evening) and thousands more affected by the tornado. Obama to view Joplin tornado damage . Then at 5:41 p.m. -- exactly one week after an EF-5 tornado, with winds over 200 mph, first touched down -- the city will go silent. That moment will be a stark contrast to the fury the Rev. Justin Monaghan experienced as the twister barrelled toward St. Mary's Catholic Church. The 70-year-old pastor got in a bathtub at the church, put his face down and prayed. When the winds ceased, Monaghan found himself trapped in the rubble -- where he remained until some of his parishioners rescued him, unscathed. While he's still coming to grips with what happened, Monaghan said he believes that good will come out of this tragedy and in fact already has. ""God allows things to happen that we don't know why,"" the pastor said earlier this week. ""But when we look back, we always hear the good things that happen as a result."" That positive energy was on display Saturday on the church grounds. There, parishioners and volunteers picked through the debris looking for items to salvage, Monaghan said. One found the pastor's Bible, and another was able to save his golf clubs. Two tornado-wracked towns unite through tragedy, charity . ""The enthusiasm was unbelievable, even as people were shedding tears,"" Monaghan said. ""It's just wonderful to see."" On Sunday, Monaghan said he will celebrate Mass at St. Peter's, another Catholic church in Joplin. And if and when his church is rebuilt -- something that he expects will happen, with the parish council's support -- the pastor said a 6-foot cross that somehow braved the storm will be a part of it, behind the altar. ""We wouldn't dream of not using that,"" he said. The Bridge Ministries, a nondenominational Christian youth organization, has opened its doors to schools, relief agencies and churches in need of space. They include members of St. Paul's United Methodist Church, which will hold their Sunday services at the ministries' center after their own facility was severely damaged in the storm. Dan Mitchell, the organization's president, said he has been impressed that so many people, from near and far, offered help. Food, water and clothing have come in everything from car trunks to tractor-trailers, he said, and the center's parking lot has transformed into a distribution point for supplies. Meanwhile, Mitchell said that locals directly affected have seen their faith strengthened in the past week. ""Faithful Christians who understand that God creates order from chaos have stood up and done what it takes,"" he said. ""They have given up their lives. If they come up against roadblocks, they get around them and they get it done."" CNN's Jacqui Jeras and Mike Pearson contributed to this report.","Sunday marks the one-week anniversary of the EF-5 tornado that hit Joplin, Missouri .

1244,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Thursday. The final tally was 293 against the motion and 152 for it. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party filed the no-confidence motion Wednesday, and needed a simple majority for it to pass in parliament, and fell far short of that number. It cited his handling of the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and ensuing nuclear crisis as a reason for the motion. Had the motion passed, Kan would have been required to step down within 10 days or dissolve the lower house of parliament and force a snap election. A devastating tsunami struck Japan's Pacific coast after the massive earthquake in March, triggering the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl as the cores of reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant overheated and spewed radioactive chemicals. Kan, who was unpopular before the disaster, has come under fire as the nation battles to contain the nuclear and economic woes. Adding on to the problems, ratings agency Moody's Investors Service placed the country's local and foreign currency bond ratings on review for possible downgrade. Political in-fighting remains a problem in Japan, which has seen six prime ministers in the past five years. Last year, after only a few months in office, his main political opponent within his own party attempted to take control of the Democratic Party of Japan, effectively taking over the premiership. Kan managed to hold onto the title of party leader. Kan's one-year anniversary in office is June 8.

1245,"(CNN) -- Hours after the inauguration of President Goodluck Jonathan, a bomb blast rocked the northern Nigerian city of Bauchi, a government spokesman said. Yushau Shuaib, a spokesman for Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency, confirmed that there are several casualties, though he did not give a specific number. ""Most victims were moved to hospitals and dead bodies were evacuated,"" he said. The emergency management agency has been mobilized ""to contain the situation,"" Shuaib added. Another explosion rattled a beer hall in Zuba, on the outskirts of the Nigerian capital of Abuja. Shuaib said there were no serious injuries in that blast, with three victims taking themselves to a nearby hospital. In recent weeks, the African nation has been rocked by a series of bombings thought to be engineered by Boko Haram, an Islamic group that has challenged Nigeria's government. Explosions in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno killed a few and wounded dozens in late April in the days leading up to national governorship elections in attacks that police described as attempts to intimidate voters who had picked Jonathan. Northern Muslims in some areas charged that the presidential election was rigged. Armed protesters in the region took to the streets chanting the name of former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, the main opposition front-runner. This is Jonathan's first full term. As vice president, he took over the presidency in May 2010 upon the death of then-President Umaru Yar'Adua, who had suffered from a heart condition.","NEW: 3 hurt in a blast at a beer hall near Abuja, a government official says .

1246,"Tokyo (CNN) -- The United Nations nuclear watchdog agency said Wednesday that Japan underestimated the hazard posed by tsunamis to nuclear plants but praised the country's response to the Fukushima Daiichi crisis as ""exemplary."" The International Atomic Energy Agency announced a preliminary summary of safety issues related to the crippled power plant. The plant was damaged after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern Japan and killed more than 14,000 people and left another 10,000 people missing. An international team of nuclear experts from 12 countries participated in a fact-finding mission and completed its preliminary assessment Wednesday, the agency said. The team said nuclear designers and operators should ""evaluate and provide protection against the risks of all natural hazards."". ""These tsunami waves overwhelmed the defenses of TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi facility, which were only designed to withstand tsunami waves of a maximum of 5.7 meters (18.7 feet) high. The larger waves that impacted this facility on that day were estimated to be larger than 14 meters (46 feet) high,"" the report said, referring to the plant's owners, Tokyo Electric Power Co. ""The tsunami waves reached areas deep within units causing the loss of all power sources except for one emergency diesel generator ... with no other significant power source available on or off the site, and little hope of outside assistance."" The team also said despite the ""brave and sometimes novel"" efforts by operational staff to control and cool reactors and spent fuel, the fuel was severely damaged and a series of explosions occurred. ""The operators were faced with a catastrophic, unprecedented emergency scenario with no power, reactor control or instrumentation,"" the summary said. ""They had to work in darkness with almost no instrumentation and control systems to secure the safety of six reactors, six associated fuel pools, a common fuel pool, and dry cask storage facilities."" Team leader Mike Weightman, the UK's chief inspector of nuclear installations, said the team was humbled by massive damage caused by the tsunami. ""We are also profoundly impressed by the dedication of Japanese workers working to resolve this unprecedented nuclear accident,"" Weightman said in an agency statement. The team also praised Japan's ""long-term"" response, including the ""impressive and well organized"" evacuation of the area around the stricken reactors. ""A suitable and timely follow-up program on public and worker exposures and health monitoring would be beneficial,"" the team said. The draft report summary was delivered to Japanese authorities Wednesday, the agency said. A final report will be delivered to the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety at the agency's headquarters in Vienna in late June.","International nuclear experts assess safety issues stemming from Fukushima Daiichi .

1247,"Moscow (CNN) -- Specialist military divers have arrived at the site where a Russian cruise ship sank over the weekend, killing more than 100 people, the Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday. The highly trained divers, who specialize in rescue operations and lifting sunken ships, have orders to present a plan to raise the ""Bulgaria"" from the Volga River as soon as possible, the ministry said in a press release. Some of the divers participated in lifting the Russian nuclear submarine ""Kursk,"" which exploded and sank in the Barents Sea in August 2000, the Defense Ministry said. The bodies of two more children were recovered Wednesday from the ship, Russian authorities told CNN, bringing the number of bodies recovered to 102.  There are still 20 people missing of the more than 200 people believed to have been on the vessel, officials said. At least 85 of the victims have been identified, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. Four people face charges over the sinking of the ship Sunday, which Russian media are calling the most devastating river accident in the country's history.  The vessel went down in the Russian republic of Tatarstan. Svetlana Inyakina, general director of Argorechtur, the company that rented the cruise boat ""Bulgaria,"" and Yakov Ivashov, a manager at the Kama River Register, have been detained, Russia's Investigative Committee said. They are charged with providing services that do not meet safety standards which resulted in multiple deaths, and if convicted could be jailed for up to 10 years. Criminal charges are also being brought against the captains of two ships that are accused of passing the sinking boat without stopping to help the people in the water, the committee said. They could face heavy fines or up to three years in prison. Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin, who is also head of the special government commission investigating the accident, said divers will search around the clock until all of the victims are found.  Recovery efforts will also include small planes conducting reconnaissance flights as far as 80 miles downstream, the minister said. There were 175 scuba divers working on the scene, authorities said Tuesday. Russian state TV said they were working underwater in low visibility and against a heavy current that is moving the boat, which is lying at the bottom of the river. Russia observed a day of mourning Tuesday with church services all across the country, flags flying at half-staff and national television canceling all entertainment programming. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the federal government would pay 1 million rubles ($35,500) to the families of each of the dead. He also promised 400,000 rubles ($14,250) to those who suffered major and moderately severe injuries, and half that sum to people with minor injuries. Among the bodies to have been recovered are those of the ship's captain Alexander Ostrovsky and his wife, local officials in Tatarstan told Russian media at the site of the accident. At least 79 people were rescued, some of whom have been released from hospitals after receiving medical treatment, according to government agencies. The ship did not have a license to transport passengers, was overloaded, and was last repaired more than 30 years ago, the Russian Prosecutor's Office said Monday. Prosecutors also established that the left engine of the ship was damaged, they said on their website. Russian state TV reported the vessel had an operational limit of about 150 passengers, citing a top government official on site. State TV also reported, citing law enforcement officials, that there were life vests on board for only 156 people. Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu said earlier there were 208 people aboard the ship, of whom 25 passengers were not officially registered and didn't have tickets. The state news agency RIA Novosti reported that 205 people were on board. The ferry was built in 1955 in Czechoslovakia, according to Russian law enforcement officials. The double-deck cruise ship went down near the village of Syukeyevo in Tatarstan, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the city of Kazan. Kazan is about 724 kilometers (450 miles) east of Moscow.

1248,"(CNN) -- Syrian tanks stormed the flashpoint city of Hama Sunday in one of several clashes that rights groups said left more than 70 people dead and more than 100 injured nationwide. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported that at least 71 people were killed across the country, with at least 50 killed in Hama. Other human rights organizations offered different assessments of the situation, with some reporting that more than 100 people died in the city of Hama alone. A doctor in Hama said that more than 100 people were killed in the city and its surrounding areas. ""I feel terrible. I am exhausted, psychologically exhausted, the pain. I can't imagine a brother is killing his brother. And what for? For the president? It's terrible here. We see a lot of this blood and things -- 115 dead -- it's too much for one day,"" he said. CNN was unable to independently confirm the death tolls. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said security forces were responding to ""armed groups"" in Hama who blocked streets with barricades and terrorized citizens by firing from the rooftops of buildings, while human rights groups described the arrival of tanks as a raid on the city. Three members of security forces were killed in clashes in Hama and three members of the military were killed in Deir Ezzour, SANA said. The government-run agency said ""armed terrorist groups"" had taken to the streets in Deir Ezzour, attacking police headquarters and stealing weapons. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an affiliation of groups that reports on protests in the nation, reported at least 11 people were killed in Deir Ezzour. In Hama, throngs of residents took to the streets in an attempt to block the tanks, a local activist said. More than 100 were injured in the city, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. One Hama resident told CNN he was awakened at 4 a.m. by the sounds of bombs, machine guns and yelling. He said hospitals have begun calling people to come donate blood, but security forces have blocked the roads so people cannot reach the hospital. ""Security forces and army tanks, whenever they see a car moving, they start shooting at the car,"" he said. ""I'm talking to you from the streets. I have my knife,"" he said. The man said he and his neighbors are trying to protect the neighborhood, using only sticks, swords and knives. ""People are not scared here any more,"" he said. ""What's the worst? The army and security people are already killing people. We are not scared of death at all. We are willing to pay anything -- our souls, anything -- just to get our freedom."" Tanks rolling near the border met fierce resistance from residents, said Omar al Habbal, a member of the committees. ""Hama will be very harsh to them,"" said al Habbal, who lives in the city. ""The whole city has decided to resist with stones, not weapons. The army will either join the demonstrators or leave our city."" Gunfire rang through the air for hours, and thick black smoke covered areas where residents reported shelling and civilian casualties, al Habbal said. ""Mosques have been broadcasting repeated chants of 'Allah Akbar' all morning, and everybody is in the street chanting, 'The people and the army are one hand,' "" al Habbal said. Local residents reported negotiating with the troops, with protesters standing up on the tanks and cheering, ""Syria is united!"" CNN could not independently verify the accuracy of the reports. The raid marks the latest violence as anti-government protesters in the nation have called for a new regime since mid-March. Activists blame the deaths of civilians in demonstrations on security forces, but the government has consistently attributed the violence to ""armed groups."" President Bashar al-Assad has drawn criticism at home and abroad for his tough crackdown on the protesters calling for his ouster. A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday the United Nations chief was ""deeply concerned"" about reports of hundreds of protesters killed and injured. ""He strongly condemns the use of force against the civilian population and calls on the government of Syria to halt this violent offensive at once,"" the spokesman said in a statement, referring to Ban. U.S. President Barack Obama said he was ""appalled"" and pledged that U.S. officials will increase pressure on the Syrian regime, ""isolate the Assad government and stand with the Syrian people."" ""The reports out of Hama are horrifying and demonstrate the true character of the Syrian regime,"" Obama said in a statement. British Foreign Secretary William Hague also condemned the reported attacks. ""The attack appears to be part of a coordinated effort across a number of towns in Syria to deter the Syrian people from protesting in advance of Ramadan. The attacks are all the more shocking on the eve of the Muslim holy month,"" he said in a statement. ""President Bashar is mistaken if he believes that oppression and military force will end the crisis in his country. He should stop this assault on his own people now."" Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch said government forces targeted the city. ""Hama is the latest city to fall victim to President Bashar al-Assad's security forces despite his promises that his government would tolerate peaceful protests,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Security forces have responded to protests with the brutality that's become familiar over the past several months."" The humanitarian watchdog said earlier this month that the forces raided homes, opened fire and set up checkpoints in and around the restive city, the site of a deadly military clampdown nearly 30 years ago.

1249,"(CNN) -- Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, was closed Thursday night, stranding hundreds of passengers, after being struck by two violent storms packing high winds and massive hail, the airport director said. Omaha Airport Authority Executive Director Steve Coufal said that the airfield had been closed for several hours, with at least one reported injury: a pilot who was taken to a local hospital after being struck by hail. Southwest Airlines spokesperson Ashley Dillon said two of the airline's planes were on the ground -- one of them Flight 751 to Chicago, which was being boarded -- when the first storm hit. The decision was made to deplane the 137 passengers from the Boeing 737, and a male pilot was struck by hail while standing in the jetway. Dillon said he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital. Southwest discontinued its flights for the remainder of the night. Dillon said 13 flights were affected: eight arrivals and five departures. The first storms came through Omaha at about 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET). The airport was subsequently shut down so that airport officials could evaluate damage done to equipment. After about an hour-and-a-half, the airport was reopened, but was closed again minutes later when the second storm came through, packing very strong winds and heavy rains, Coufal said. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said hailstones were reportedly up 2.75 inches in diameter, or approximately baseball-sized. Video footage from local CNN affiliate KPTM seemed to confirm that estimate, as the windshields of several cars in the airport parking lot were either shattered or bore large holes and craters. The airport director said winds of about 100 mph were reported, and visibility was 5-10 feet. Airport officials were inspecting damage and meeting with transportation officials Thursday night to address passengers' needs. Coufal said seven commercial planes received some degree of damage, and parked surface vehicles had extensive damage. Also, the roof, some windows and signage were damaged at the facility. One jet bridge was blown into an aircraft by the winds, according to Coufal.

1250,"(CNN) -- Four more people have died in Germany, health officials said Sunday, bringing the total number of deaths from an E. coli outbreak to 35. All but one of the deaths were in Germany, with the other occurring in Sweden, according to the World Health Organization and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. The number of people infected with E. coli as of Sunday was 3,256, according to the European center (ECDC). Of those, 812 have the severe form of the intestinal illness. All but five people had traveled to or lived in Germany during the incubation period for infection, typically three to four days after exposure, the WHO said. German authorities have indicated that food items including bean sprouts and other vegetables originating from a producer in Lower Saxony, Germany, are the most likely source of the infection. German health authorities have declared that all food products originating from the producer be pulled from the market, according to the ECDC. The agricultural ministry in Lower Saxony said Sunday that it is still not clear how sprouts from a farm in the state became contaminated with the bacteria. ""It is not clear whether an employee brought the bacteria into the company or whether it was brought in with seeds which then contaminated the worker,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Finding this out is important, however, so that we can create early warning systems to prevent such outbreaks in the future,"" the statement said. Investigators found bean sprouts were the cause of the outbreak when 17 people became ill after eating at the same restaurant, said Reinhard Burger, president of the Robert Koch Institute, which is responsible for disease control and prevention in Germany. Only those who ate food containing the sprouts became ill, he said. Farmers in Spain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium have been seeking compensation for their losses. The European Commission has proposed that the European Union pay about $300 million, but Spain alone claims about $600 million in losses. In Spain, the produce exporter Frunet filed suit last week over the Hamburg state government's initial claims that Spanish produce was to blame for the outbreak.  The company, based in Spain's southern Malaga province, expects to file another suit against the government seeking 1 million euros, or $1.4 million, in losses from fresh produce it had to destroy, Frunet owner Antonio Lavao told CNN. Health officials first blamed Frunet's organic cucumbers for the outbreak. CNN's Al Goodman and Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Health officials say the cause of contamination is still unclear .

1251,"Moscow (CNN) -- Divers have completed their search of a Russian cruise ship that sank last weekend with the loss of many lives, the Emergency Situations Ministry told CNN Friday. The official death toll has reached 114 -- including 66 women, 28 children and 20 men, the ministry said. The bodies of 15 people are still missing. There were 208 people on the ""Bulgaria"" at the time of the accident Sunday, of whom 79 were rescued. Divers have checked all the boat's compartments, the ministry said, and are now looking for more bodies around the boat as well downstream on the Volga River, where they could have been carried by the current. The area where search efforts continue has been enlarged to 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the scene, Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin said at a briefing Friday. Preparations are under way for the cruise ship to be raised from the river bottom in the coming days. Two large boat cranes, one from Moscow and another one from Volgograd, which will be used for the lifting, are on the way to the accident site. ""We have asked the Emergency Situations Ministry to keep 23 divers at the scene to continue the search for bodies even during the lifting operation,"" Levitin said. Specialist military divers were brought in mid-week to aid in the search efforts. Four people face criminal charges over the sinking of the ship, which Russian media have called the most devastating river accident in the country's history. All agencies and organizations involved in tourism must be held accountable, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said at a special government meeting Friday devoted to the accident. ""This means that not only people who rubber-stamp documents, not only scapegoats, but also organizers of cruises must answer,"" he said, in comments broadcast by Russian state TV. ""The measure of punishment to be chosen must make it clear to each executive, irrespective of rank, that he or she will be held responsible for each cruise not only administratively, but also criminally. Criminal liability must be sufficiently serious."" Medvedev said it would be too expensive and complicated for Russia immediately to replace the fleets of ageing ships in use on rivers and at sea. But, he said, that did not mean those carrying out inspections should not be thorough. ""It is our task to find out the causes of the accident -- they are more or less clear now -- and also to prevent disasters,"" he said. ArgoRechTour, the company that sub-leased the ""Bulgaria"", had illegally organized five cruises on the ship in the summer of 2011 prior to the accident, the Russian Prosecutor General's Office said in a report published on its website Friday. The vessel did not have a license to transport passengers, was overloaded, and was last repaired more than 30 years ago, the prosecutors said earlier this week. They had also established that the left engine of the ship was damaged, the prosecutors said on their website. The vessel was built in 1955 in Czechoslovakia, according to Russian law enforcement officials. The double-deck cruise ship went down near the village of Syukeyevo in Tatarstan, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the city of Kazan. Kazan is about 724 kilometers (450 miles) east of Moscow.","NEW: The search for bodies has been extended to 125 miles from the scene, the transport minister says .

1252,"(CNN) -- The Canadian woman who was rescued after being stranded and alone for 49 days in a Nevada wilderness left behind handwritten notes about her ordeal, officials said Monday. The notes were found in the van where Rita Chretien was found on Friday, said Owyhee County (Idaho) Sheriff Daryl Crandall. The van was in remote territory near where Oregon, Idaho and Nevada meet. ""Please help. Stuck"" is the way one note begins. The call for help has a date written below it that simply reads ""since Mar 19/11."" According to officials, the date marks the last time anyone had seen Chretien or her husband. The next line continues with ""No food. No gas. Dead bat. (battery) Lost my way!"" Then the writing gets smaller as the space on the paper begins to run out, the note now reads, ""Al went to get help. Find Mountain City. Did not return!"" And finally, the last words on the page written in red read, ""Maybe died along the way?"" Written in smaller spaces on the paper in a different ink is the couple's name, where they are from, and their phone number. The note also gives name and number of the couple's son, and the date the couple is expected back in home. A second note starts with detailed GPS readings on it, and then outlines the couples inability to get cell service in the rugged mountainous area. Scribbled on the side of the second note is a message that started ""We're headed to Vegas"" and ended ""Got lost."" Pictures of these notes were taken by the Owyhee County Sheriff's Department amid the weekend search for Albert Chretien, who remained missing three days after his wife's rescue. He left his wife to get help three days after their minivan got stranded off-road in the cold, untamed wilderness. That left Rita alone without much beyond some hard candy, a bag of trail mix, some books and the clothes she'd packed for her trip to Las Vegas. Plus, according to her son Raymond Chretien, she always had faith. Scores of men and women had searched for the Chretiens since the Penticton, British Columbia, residents were last seen March 19 leaving a Shell gas station convenience store in Baker City, Oregon. On Friday, more than a month later, hunters wandered into the area where the van was sitting. Rita Chretien shot up from her spot in the 2000 Chevrolet Astro's backseat when she heard them outside, mustered her lingering strength to open the door and step out shoeless. She waved. Three days later, she was in fair condition, resting comfortably in an Idaho hospital, spending time with her children. ""Right now, we're just celebrating,"" said her son, Raymond, on Sunday, Mother's Day. Even the doctor who oversaw Chretien's care at St. Luke's Magic Valley Medical Center in Twin Falls, Idaho, acknowledged it was not easy to explain how a 56-year-old woman could have such a positive prognosis and demeanor given what she'd gone through. ""In this case, for a person with suboptimal nutrition to survive so long -- let's just say that it is understandable to call it a miracle,"" Dr. James Westberry told reporters Sunday. While rainy and overcast weather forced authorities to call off the first day's air search for Albert Chretien, Cpl. Dan Moskaluk of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Saturday that a search dog and about 20 people, riding six to eight all-terrain and four-wheel drive vehicles were on the case. A K-9 unit was also brought in by the Owyhee County Sheriff's Department to help search for the missing man on Saturday. Paula McCollum and her dog Viva covered about four miles in each direction looking for any sign of Chretien. But after the daylight started to fade and weather took a turn for the worse, search efforts came to halt. McCollum said she was shocked that Rita Chretien was able to survive the cold, mountainous region alone, and she wished her husband had remained at her side. ""People keep going,"" McCollum said as she recounted her efforts to locate Albert Chretien, ""they don't turn-around."" But by backtracking the Chretiens may have found their way back to a road, she said. Sheriff Crandall agreed. He said the couple's van was found five to eight miles from a ranch where they could have gotten help. Pictures released by the sheriff's department show the van in a extremely remote area with no visible roads. The van was stuck in caked mud, ,a shovel pictured near the back of the van, indicating that someone had been trying to free the vehicle from the mud. While the odds are dwindling that Albert Chretien will be found alive, authorities certainly are not ruling it out, said the police spokesman. ""Neither family nor investigators would have thought that we'd be reporting, after seven weeks, of actually finding somebody alive,"" Moskaluk said. ""Until we know exactly what happened to Al, it remains a mystery."" Rita and Albert Chretien's stop in Baker City was recorded on the store's surveillance tape. They were en route to a trade show convention in Las Vegas. But they later turned off the highway onto a forest service road that led into Nevada, intending to enjoy the ""scenic route,"" said her son, who'd heard the full story from his ailing mother. The couple took some wrong turns and had thought, based on their map, that their road was better than it was. Then, about 20 miles from the highway, ""apparently the road conditions ... degraded quite drastically,"" said Moskaluk, the police spokesman. By the time darkness fell, the minivan had succumbed to the combination of snow and mud, and was unable to move. On March 22, Albert Chretien left the van, setting off to get help. His wife, who Raymond Chretien said is ""not an outdoorsy type of person,"" remained behind. Rita Chretien rationed the little food available -- a beef jerky, some trail mix, fish oil pills, and one piece of hard candy per day. She'd go outside for a walk once a day, using the sunlight to melt snow for drinking water and going to a nearby stream. In the meantime, she had plenty of time to read a few books (some several times) and the Bible, and record her thoughts in a journal. ""She did it because she didn't know the outcome of this,"" her son said, adding that he had not yet read the journal. ""It was intended to sort of tell the story what happened over (those) days."" All the while, Rita Chretien got weaker, losing 20 to 30 pounds, according to Moskaluk. Her son said that, in her last few days in the wild, she'd come to peace with the sense that her time was dwindling. She penciled May 6 as a critical day in her mind: -- either she'd be rescued or she'd die. ""She definitely had hope. But of course, just like us, every day goes by, you start preparing yourself for both options,"" her son said. ""So she was prepared for either."" After her discovery, Rita Chretien was airlifted to the Idaho hospital. There, doctors worked first to address her starvation and dehydration, then to build up her ability to eat meals again and gain strength. By Sunday, Westberry said he still hadn't seen her walk, but he said there were no indications of long-term problems and her prognosis was good. Her spirits and evident desire to live, the doctor said, were even better. ""It is unusual for us to see someone in this type of situation to actually not only survive, but to be doing so well at this time,"" Westberry said. ""She obviously had the mindset of survival, and that must have been something that helped her go as long as she did."" For her son, the best thing was how little his mother had changed after her ordeal. She laughed just the same, and was just as warm, genuine and caring as she'd always been, he said. ""I would have hardly known anything had happened to her,"" he said. ""It was just beyond belief. It's just her. It's amazing.""

1253,"Joplin, Missouri (CNN) -- A Missouri mother said Thursday that her 16-year-old son was killed by this week's powerful tornado, one of scores who have been confirmed dead even as authorities try to track down many others who are considered missing. Michelle Hare told CNN that her son Lantz, who was ripped from a car Sunday night by winds exceeding 200 mph in Joplin, is dead and his body has been located. In the wrenching hours and days since the tornado, the boy's father, Mike Hare, said he'd searched hospitals and continually called his son's cell phone, getting no answer. ""It rang for the first day and a half, and now it goes straight to voice mail. But just in case he gets it, I want him to know his dad loves him,"" the father said earlier this week. Lantz Hare was among those on the list, released Thursday by the Missouri Department of Public Safety, of 232 people from the southwest Missouri city for whom missing persons reports have been filled out. At least 126 people in Joplin had died due to the storm as of Thursday night, said Newton County Coroner Mark Bridges. That makes the tornado the single deadliest to touch down in any U.S. community since modern record-keeping began in 1950. The Hares were among many around Joplin, still desparately searching for missing loved ones and clinging to hope. Christina, Caleb and Robert Hayward, for instance, have not seen their mother since the tornado. ""She went for pizza and never came back. It was three, four hours, and we knew,"" Robert Hayward said Wednesday.  ""We all miss her. She was a great person. She didn't deserve this at all. Any one of us would trade places with her."" One of the frustrations for families desperately trying to find their loved ones was a holdup at the morgue. Some were told that they may have to wait for two weeks before they can visit the morgue to search for relatives. Bridges told CNN that people who can make a positive identification of a relative, such as through tattoos, will be allowed to view a body matching that description. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said state officials were brought in ""to get this information out much more quickly and respectfully for these families that need to hear the information about the loved ones who are -- have been lost."" Families of the missing have provided DNA samples and contacted dozens of hospitals, shelters and nursing homes in their bids to learn whether they have a ""John Doe"" or ""Jane Doe"" that could be their loved one. Charles Writer, 74, is one of 12 residents of Greenbriar Nursing Home on the unaccounted for list. Ten residents and a staff member at the home were killed, a company official said. Writer's family received conflicting reports on the Alzheimer's patient's possible fate, said Leah Mitchell, whose husband is Writer's nephew. They have handed out flyers and used a spreadsheet to contact about several dozen facilities. ""There are two sides of the family,"" said Mitchell. ""One has accepted he's deceased, the other side is not sure."" Patricia Dawson's family Thursday continued its search for the 74-year-old Joplin homemaker. They, too, have contacted many hospitals and nursing homes within 200 miles. Daughter-in-law Sharyn Dawson said the missing woman ""is an awesome granny to our 6-year-old,"" who hasn't been told about the situation.

1254,"(CNN) -- Passengers were evacuated from a Delta aircraft after smoke began coming from the wheel area, after it landed at Atlanta's airport Saturday afternoon, a witnesses and company official said. Flight 2284 had just arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport from Pittsburgh, around 4:14 p.m. when the incident occurred, said Delta spokeswoman Leslie Parker. Parker said the plane's brakes overheated, causing smoke. According to Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen, one of the plane's tires blew out. ""After (the plane) landed there was a big boom, and then just a line of smoke,"" Kalel Dunst, who saw the incident from a hotel room nearby, told CNN. ""It turned off the runway, and the fire got a lot bigger."" According to Parker, none of the 44 passengers or five crew members on board were injured. All were safely evacuated and bussed to the terminal. She said they departed the plane by slides, though Bergen said they took the back stairs. The aircraft -- an MD 88 -- will be taken out of service and evaluated, the Delta spokeswoman said. CNN's Justin Lear contributed to this report.","Delta Flight 2284 arrives in Atlanta from Pittsburgh when a witness reports a ""big boom""

1255,"(CNN) -- Vietnamese authorities are on alert for animal smugglers after four bags of deadly snakes were found on a train from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, according to local press reports. The bags contained an undetermined number of snakes including some king cobras, the on-line news service VnExpress reported. A guard and a conductor found them while inspecting the train when it made a stop at Quang Ngai railway station on Thursday, the website reported. The guard and conductor were not injured. Passengers panicked when they heard about the snakes, VnExpress said. The snakes, which are protected by law in Vietnam, were handed over to the Quang Ngai forest protection agency on Friday and released into the wild. Some of the snakes weighed more than one kilogram (2.2 pounds) each, said Nguyen Van Han, chief of the forest protection unit. Officials in Quang Ngai will increase patrols and inspection the North-South railway, roads and restaurants to prevent the smuggling of wild animals, according toTuoitrenews, an online publication of a Vietnamese newspaper. The king cobra is the world's longest venomous snake with a length up to 13 feet (4 meters) according to New York's Bronx Zoo, which had an Egyptian cobra escape earlier this year. That cobra was found in the zoo's reptile house a week after it escaped from its enclosure.","Four bags of venomous cobras are found on a train bound for Hanoi, local press reports say .

1256,"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony's white Pontiac Sunbird is a crushed slab in a Florida junkyard, nearly seven weeks after she was acquitted of murder in her 2-year-old daughter's death, according a person in a law office close to the case. An assistant in the office of Mark Lippman -- who represents George and Cindy Anthony, who owned the car before giving it to their daughter, Casey -- said Friday that the car was destroyed a day earlier. The assistant declined to be named. That the vehicle had been crushed was first reported and documented by Florida TV station WOFL. The car, and the odor emanating from its trunk, had been central to the prosecution's case in Anthony's murder trial. On June 27, 2008, she abandoned the Pontiac at an Orlando business, saying it had run out of gas, according to testimony. It later was towed to a wrecker yard, where it remained until July 15 of that year, when George and Cindy Anthony got a letter from the yard and went to pick up the car. Several witnesses, including a tow yard employee and George Anthony, said there was a vile smell coming from car's trunk. The prosecution alleged -- and expert witnesses testified -- that the odor was that of human decomposition. They claimed Casey Anthony duct-taped her daughter's mouth and nose to suffocate her, and then put the body in the Pontiac's trunk before disposing of it. But the defense rebutted these claims, with attorney Jose Baez blasting what he called ""the state's fantasy of forensics"" in his closing argument. Defense attorneys maintained the child, Caylee, drowned in the Anthony's above-ground pool on June 16, and that Casey Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. George Anthony denied that in his testimony. Baez claimed a ""phantom stain"" in the trunk should have included more in the way of DNA evidence. He said the state used ""junk science"" relating to the odor and stain in the Pontiac's trunk to reach its conclusions. After Anthony was cleared on the murder charge -- and convicted on four lesser counts of misleading law enforcement -- alternate juror Russell Huekler told HLN that he had a difficult time accepting that Caylee's body had been in the car trunk.

1257,"(CNN) -- A reactor at Japan's Ohi nuclear plant will be shut down following problems with an emergency cooling system, Kansai Electric said Saturday. The move follows an emergency alarm late Friday triggered when the pressure dropped in the tank for the cooling system, company spokesperson Masaki Todatake said. Pressure returned to normal within about an hour after an injection of liquid nitrogen, but engineers plan to manually stop the No. 1 reactor at the Ohi plant in Fukui Prefecture to carry out a full inspection,Todatake said. It is not known how soon the reactor might start operating again, the company said, but there is no danger of radiation leak. The reactor's closure leaves only 18 of Japan's 54 nuclear plants producing electricity, worsening power supply problems following March's earthquake and tsunami. The 15-meter (48-foot) tsunami inundated Japan's coastal Fukushima Daiichi power plant, leading to a triple meltdown, the aftermath of which Tokyo Electric Power Co. engineers are still struggling to manage. The disaster has caused Japan to rethink its commitment to nuclear energy.

1258,"(CNN) -- The Boston Bruins won their first Stanley Cup in 39 years, defeating the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 Wednesday night in the seventh and deciding game of the National Hockey League's annual championship. The loss didn't go over well with hundreds of mostly young Canuck fans, who took to the streets and set several overturned vehicles afire a few blocks from Rogers Arena where the game was played. Some fans stopped to pose in front of the flames. Others danced on top of another overturned vehicle. A dull cloud of gray smoke choked some areas of downtown. iReport: Fires, rioting and looting in Vancouver . Aerial footage showed Vancouver police wading into the unruly crowd that continually taunted and threw things at the officers. Members of the crowd leaped over one street fire, and officers wrestled several fans to the ground. ""We're unable to release anything formal at the moment but officers are busy dealing with a few core groups of people bent on committing criminal acts like mischief, vandalism, and fights,"" Vancouver Police Media Relations Officer Lindsey Houghton said in a statement. ""We're working hard to get everyone home safe."" Freelance Journalist Jorge Contreras told CNN that 1,000-2,000 people were on the streets in downtown Vancouver, and that six police vehicles had been set on fire. After dropping the first two games in Vancouver, the Bruins took four of the last five games from the Canucks, who struggled to stay in Game Seven after going down 1-0 in the first period. The Bruins blew open the game in the second, after rookie Brad Marchand sprung on a rebound off of Canuck goalie Roberto Luongo to put away his second goal of the match. ""We knew the second goal was going to be huge,"" Marchand, the 23-year-old rookie said in a post-game interview. ""It was nice to get that one, and we kept pushing forward after that."" Marchand would finish the game with two goals and one assist. But the game was really decided by Thomas, who polished off his spectacular playoff performance with a Game Seven shutout to take the coveted Conn Smythe trophy. Tim Thomas -- whose unorthodox goalkeeping mystified the Canucks all night -- set the NHL record for most shots faced and most saves in playoff history. He also shattered Johnny Bower's 1960s record for most saves in a Stanley Cup final. Coming into the series, Vancouver was considered the superior squad on special teams, especially on power plays. But that wasn't the case in this year's Stanley Cup, as Boston put away five power play goals to Vancouver's two. Vancouver was also outscored 10-0 in the second period. ""We finally brought our game from home on the road,"" Zdeno Chara told Team Radio Canada. ""We played physical and took care of the puck, played extremely hard and paid attention to the details."" Patrice Bergeron's first period goal should have been enough for fans to know the game's outcome, as the team that scored the first goal won every game in this series. The Bruins now have won the Stanley Cup six times, fourth-most among all NHL franchises, but hadn't captured the sport's most coveted prize since 1972. They had been to the finals five other times since they last won, but this time marked their first appearance since 1990. The Canucks have been to the finals three times in their 40 seasons in the league, but have never won. Holding the home-ice advantage, they won the first two games of the series, but lost all three games played in Boston before losing at home on Wednesday. They were seeking to become the first Canadian team to win the NHL title since the Montreal Canadiens in 1993.","Police move in after Vancouver fans set vehicle afire, throw items .

1259,"(CNN) -- A mother and two children drowned inside a car Friday after floodwater washed their vehicle away, a Pittsburgh city official said. The city experienced a heavy storm and flooding shortly after 4 p.m. Friday, said Michael Huss, Pittsburgh director of Public Safety. ""The manhole covers began to lift from the rush of water, and the roadway flooded,"" Huss said. CNN affiliate WTAE reported that the incident took place in the eastern Pittsburgh neighborhood of Highland Park in Pennsylvania. Huss said the family's vehicle washed down the roadway and got stuck next to a tree. ""The three could not get out of the car before it was submerged,"" Huss said. ""The water had a lot of force behind (it), and all three inside drowned."" In addition, Huss said, ""We have one person whose car was located, but that person is still unaccounted for."" Dive units were searching late Friday night.","Floodwater washes a family's vehicle away in Pittsburgh .

1260,"(CNN) -- A seminary student who was in Haiti along with his wife and cousin is believed to have been killed in the magnitude-7.0 earthquake that struck the island nation, his family and seminary said Thursday. Benjamin Larson, 25, from LaCrosse, Wisconsin, the son of two Lutheran ministers, was in his fourth year as a master's of divinity student at Wartburg Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa. He was in Haiti, along with his wife, Renee, and his cousin Jonathan Larson, both of whom also are fourth-year seminary students, to help with the new Haiti Lutheran Church, said a statement on the Web site of the First Lutheran Church in Duluth, where Benjamin Larson's mother, the Rev. April Larson, is pastor. His father, the Rev. Judd Larson, is interim pastor at Our Savior's Lutheran Church in Duluth. ""Pastors April and Judd Larson wish to share with you ... the profound sorrow with which they are living, and to ask for your prayers,"" the statement said. The Larsons received a message early Thursday that their son had been killed, according to the statement. Benjamin Larson was teaching at the Pastors and Lay Leaders Theological Conference in Haiti, the statement said. At the time of the quake, the three relatives were staying at St. Joseph's Home for Boys on a mountain in Port-au-Prince, First Lutheran Church said. ""During the earthquake, the building collapsed on all three."" Renee and Jonathan Larson were able to escape, but could not find Benjamin Larson, the statement said. They had to flee down the mountain immediately. Wednesday morning, Renee Larson and others returned to try to find Ben, to no avail, according to the First Lutheran statement and a statement from seminary President Duane Larson. (He is not closely related to the students). Renee and Jonathan Larson were at the U.S. Embassy in Haiti, and were to be evacuated to the Dominican Republic on Thursday, Duane Larson said. They are expected to be returned to the United States this week, he said. Jonathan Larson, of Red Wing, Minnesota, and his cousin were serving as teachers in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Haiti for a January term project, Duane Larson said. Renee Larson, originally of Garrison, North Dakota, was doing interviews and research for her thesis on the beginnings of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Haiti. ""Ben was so excited to become a pastor,"" April Larson said in the First Lutheran statement. ""Ben loved Christ and he loved people."" In an interview with the ECLA news service, cited by the seminary in a written statement, April Larson described her son as ""gentle, in love with Christ, in love with people, in love with life. He's been hearing God's call. His life belonged to God. If you want to know Ben, listen to his music."" Benjamin Larson was the youngest of the couple's four children, the seminary said. His name was the first released of an American victim in the Haiti quake. State Department officials said a U.S. Embassy employee also was among the dead, but did not identify the victim, saying relatives were being notified. A seminary classmate, Corrine Denis, cried as she spoke about Benjamin Larson, who she had known since their pre-seminary college days at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. ""A lot of people say, 'He would give you the shirt off his back,' but Ben really would,"" Denis said. ""He'd give you his hat and his socks and whatever you needed."" She said Larson led the music team at the college's student-led worship service. ""Ben was compassionate to the nth degree,"" she said. When he was headed to their floor on campus, she said, ""You could hear him singing in the stairwell before he got there."" He was ""full of light, and truly Christ's love emanated from him,"" Denis said. ""He was one of a kind, and we will miss him so deeply."" Duane Larson said, ""We so grieve with his parents, April and Judd; for Renee's loss of her husband; Jonathan's loss of a dear cousin, for our loss of a beautiful friend. Ben's baptismal light burned so brightly in our community and for all who came to know him. We grieve the loss of so clear a proclamation, with eyes twinkling, of Christ's love, compassion and humor."" He told reporters he had known Benjamin Larson for a couple of years before he began studying at Wartburg, and is a close friend with his family. ""It's a very personal loss."" He said the seminary student had a commitment to spreading God's word in a ""healing, musical and compassionate and easygoing way."" He said he believed the Larsons had left for Haiti on January 4. Benjamin Larson was a key member of the seminary's basketball team and played racquetball, he said. A family spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment from CNN Thursday. ""He loved God,"" April Larson told the Duluth News Tribune newspaper Thursday. ""He loved the church. He loved people. He was just one of those people that built love and community wherever he was. ""He was somebody who loved life, loved living ... a person filled up with joy. He was just a ton of fun."" In 2008, Benjamin Larson served as an intern at Our Savior's Lutheran Church in Lincoln, Nebraska. Pastor Lowell Hennigs did not want to comment to CNN Thursday, saying he had not spoken with Larson's parents. In a church newsletter from 2008, however, Hennigs wrote that both Benjamin and Renee Larson were ""delightful, outgoing and extremely talented young folks"" and musicians. Benjamin Larson composed music and liturgy and played a wide variety of instruments, he said. Rafael Malpica Padilla, executive director of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America's Global Mission Unit, told the Larsons, ""We will do everything [we] can to help find Ben and bring him home,"" the First Lutheran statement said. A fourth Wartburg student, Sarah Thomson, is safe in Jacmel, Haiti, the seminary said. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","Benjamin Larson of LaCrosse, Wisconsin, died in the Haiti quake, his family said Thursday .

1261,"(CNN) -- At least 150 people drowned when a boat leaving Libya capsized off the Tunisian coast this week, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday. Scores more were still missing as a rescue operation by Tunisian authorities continued. But at least 578 people survived the sinking Wednesday, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. On Thursday, 195 survivors were transferred to a humanitarian aid camp close to the Tunisia-Libya border, according to a statement from the refugee agency. An additional 383 survivors were expected to be taken to the same or nearby camps for help. The overcrowded boat, which set sail May 28 from Tripoli, was headed for the Italian island of Lampedusa carrying about 850 people. The passengers were mostly migrants from West Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh who were fleeing fighting in Libya, the refugee agency said in a statement. The agency said some survivors reported the boat was manned by people with little or no maritime experience. Soon after the boat left Tripoli, it ran into difficulties and by Tuesday, the passengers ran out of food and water. The boat ran aground Wednesday near the Kerkennah Islands, about 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) northwest of Tripoli in the Mediterranean Sea, the refugee agency reported. ""Desperate passengers rushed to one side, seeking rescue by the Tunisian coast guard and fishing boats that had approached the vessel,"" and the boat capsized, the agency said. ""This appears to be one of the worst and the deadliest incidents in the Mediterranean so far this year,"" said Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the refugee agency. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter Europe. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked the dangerous journey to Lampedusa. At one point, the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa, which numbers less than 6,000. ""Boats loaded with migrants fleeing the ongoing conflict in Libya have been making the journey to Italy and Malta over recent months, sometimes with tragic consequences,"" the refugee agency said in its statement. ""Just last month, hundreds died as a vessel carrying about 600 people broke up shortly after departing Tripoli.""","U.N. refugee agency: 578 people survive the sinking .

1262,"(CNN) -- Canadian authorities are trying to determine what caused a jetliner to crash near the remote Arctic outpost of Resolute Bay, killing 12 people. The jet, operated by Ontario-based carrier First Air, went down about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the airport on Saturday, First Air Vice President Chris Ferris told reporters Sunday. The dead included the four-member crew and eight of the 11 passengers aboard the Boeing 737-200, he said. ""At this time, the cause of the accident is unknown,"" he said. ""The Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation, and First Air is cooperating fully."" Two of the three survivors were flown to Ottawa, more than 2,000 miles away, for further treatment, Ferris said. His voice cracked as he thanked Canadian troops for assisting in rescue efforts. First Air flight 6560 was lost about 12:40 p.m. Saturday, about 10 minutes after its last reported communication with controllers, the airline reported. The flight took off from Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories. Firefighters, medical teams, police and members of the Canadian military were among the first to respond to the accident, according to Dominique Verdon, a spokeswoman with Canada's Department of National Defence. Authorities recovered the jet's flight recorders at the crash site, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported Saturday. Boeing offered its ""deepest sympathies"" to the families of the victims and said Canadian investigators have asked it to provide technical assistance for the investigation.

1263,"(CNN) -- The severe storms that pummeled much of the South on Monday night left at least eight people dead in three states, officials said Tuesday. Local authorities reported one death in Mississippi, six in Georgia and one in Tennessee. Severe winds and pounding rain also toppled trees and power lines, knocking out electricity in some areas. Mississippi had one fatality when a tree falling into the road hit a 20-year-old man, said Copiah County coroner Ellis Stuart. Damage was reported in 20 counties, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said. In Georgia, 70 counties reported damage, as did 43 in Tennessee, according to state emergency management agencies. In Georgia's Butts County, the sheriff's office reported two deaths -- a man and his son -- after a tree fell on their apartment building. The Georgia Emergency Management Agency said one person was killed and two others were hospitalized in the Greston community in Dodge County. In Atlanta, a tree fell on a car, killing a man in the northwest part of the city, Atlanta police said. A large tree in a private yard was uprooted and fell on a passing motorist, who was driving alone, the Atlanta Police Department said. When emergency vehicles arrived, ""it was apparent that that person was deceased,"" police spokeswoman Kim Jones said. There also was one fatality in Colquitt County and one in Irwin County, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency said. The storms knocked out power to 147,000 customers statewide, the Georgia Power Co. said early Tuesday . In Memphis, Tennessee, an 87-year-old man died when he came into contact with a downed power line in his yard, according to power provider Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division. The National Weather Service said it received nearly 600 reports of severe winds across the Southeast on Monday, 19 instances of suspected tornado-related damage and 72 reports of hail. Reports of funnel clouds poured into the weather service's office from Sumner County, Tennessee, CNN affiliate WZTV-TV in Nashville reported. ""It got so bad, I grabbed my son (and) got him in the closet,"" Chuck Carter told the station. ""We always go to the closet when we think there is a tornado in the area."" In southern Kentucky, a line of uprooted trees dotted damaged roads. No injuries were reported, however. Melvin Pendley wondered how to repair his home, which had its roof blown off. ""The ceilings are collapsed in the bedroom and half the living room,"" he told CNN affiliate WBKO-TV in Bowling Green. ""Half of the inside is still OK right now. With all this rain, we don't know what's going to happen now."" CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: Damage reported in 70 Georgia counties and 43 Tennessee counties .

1264,"(CNN) -- China evacuated more than 600,000 residents along coastal areas and sent ships back to port as it braced for Tropical Storm Muifa, which pounded some areas with gusty winds and rains over the weekend, state media reported Sunday. Muifa, once a typhoon, weakened Saturday and was eventually downgraded to a tropical storm. It spared the financial hub of Shanghai as it brushed past it. Rain and strong winds hit the city, however. Landfall was expected Monday evening local time in Liaoning province. But even as the storm weakened, authorities cancelled flights and ordered thousands of fishing boats to remain anchored in the eastern coastal province of Shandong, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Police rescued dozens of tourists stranded on an island off the port of Qingdao as water levels rose, submerging a bridge to the mainland, according to Xinhua. The heaviest rain was over water Sunday. The storm was scheduled make landfall in Liaoning province Monday evening. Eastern coastal areas can expect high winds over the next few days, Xinhua said. Meanwhile, scorching heat is expected to linger in southern regions over the next few days, Xinhua reported. Areas affected include Jiangxi, Fujian and Guangdong provinces. CNN's Ivan Cabrera contributed to this report.","NEW: State media: Authorities cancel flights and order boats to stay at port .

1265,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- An Indonesian volcano erupted twice Monday, spewing thick ash clouds a day after the number of evacuees rose to 5,200. The two eruptions occurred within 10 minutes of one another, spitting ash clouds as high as 600 meters (1,970 feet) into the air. Mt. Lokon in the northern Sulawesi province first erupted Thursday night. Since then it has erupted several more times. Authorities worry that the latest eruption sent smoke so high into the sky that it could affect flights at nearby airports. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

1266,"(CNN) -- For the first time in five years, a relief agency dedicated to refugees airlifted emergency aid into the Somali capital of Mogadishu on Monday, according to a spokesman. The flight left from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Monday morning with 31 metric tons (more than 34 U.S. tons) of emergency supplies and arrived in Mogadishu early Monday afternoon, said Andy Needham from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The aid flight comes just days after Islamic insurgents fled Mogadishu after a heated battle with government and African Union forces. But the trip has nothing to do with improved security, Needham said. ""We took the unprecedented decision to take the airlift for speed due to the famine,"" he said. Needham said the group has warehouses across Somalia and would ""normally re-stock them over land."" But the agency shifted logistics in reaction to starving people flocking to Mogadishu. Monday's plane carried almost 2,500 emergency assistance packages. Each package contains an improvised tent sheet, sleeping mats, blankets, water containers and food utensils. ""The supplies will be distributed almost immediately,"" Needham said. At least two more supply flights are in the pipeline. The next, which is due to land Thursday, will be similar to Monday's delivery. The third flight will include ""high-energy biscuits."" Also Monday, the White House announced that U.S. President Barack Obama approved an additional $105 million for relief efforts in the Horn of Africa. ""U.S. assistance will continue funding the urgently needed food, health, shelter, water and sanitation assistance to those who desperately need help,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. About 100,000 Somalis have flocked to Mogadishu in search of food and potable water, which have disappeared in a devastating famine and drought, according to the U.N. They join more than 370,000 internal refugees already in the capital in war-torn southern Somalia, many of whom also face hunger. The UNHCR is calling for more private and government donations for emergency operations in the Horn of Africa, warning that a lack of funds threatens future aid. The aid organization says it needs $145 million to cover operations through the end of the year, adding that it has received 45% of that amount so far. The U.N. declared famine in five areas of southern Somalia in June, including Mogadishu. In all, about 12 million people in the Horn of Africa region need assistance. Somalia is the worst hit.","NEW: Obama approves additional $105 million in aid for Horn of Africa .

1267,"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- New NATO airstrikes shook Tripoli into early Tuesday after the alliance's secretary-general dismissed complaints that the allied campaign against longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi had fallen into a stalemate. At least three rounds of explosions echoed across the Libyan capital in a three-hour span that began late Monday, and the roar of jets could be heard overhead. Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told CNN that the warplanes hit administrative buildings in central Tripoli, and that a nearby hospital was ""indirectly"" affected. ""Tonight was an exceptional night in Tripoli,"" Ibrahim said, noting that the strikes followed ""an extended period of calm."" ""It is very sad,"" he said. ""We are losing people every day on both sides. We think it is time to sit down and talk."" NATO warplanes and missiles have been pounding Gadhafi's forces and government installations since March 31 as Gadhafi attempts to put down a nearly three-month-old revolt against his rule. Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN on Monday that Gadhafi and his regime ""have no future,"" but refused to predict how long the Libyan leader could hold on. Rasmussen denied that the situation in Libya had devolved into a ""stalemate,"" insisting that NATO was ""making progress"" and had ""taken out"" a substantial part of Gadhafi's military capability. He said a political solution was required to bring the conflict to an end, but ""It's hard to imagine an end to the violence as long as Gadhafi remains in power."" Despite the ongoing bombardment, Gadhafi's forces have been inflicting a heavy toll on rebels in the port city of Misrata, survivors there have told CNN. Misrata is the only city in western Libya held by the rebels, and witnesses say indiscriminate shelling has left victims with crushed bones, burns and amputations. ""They are shelling the port and civilian neighborhoods. It has become an operation of revenge, not just taking over the city of Misrata,"" said Ibrahim al-Neairy, a rebel who was injured in the fighting and evacuated to Benghazi. Mostafa Bozen, a spokesman for the rebels, said fighters attacked Gadhafi's forces about 22 kilometers (14 miles) from Tripoli, killing 12 and hitting a tank. The situation in Misrata ""is at the forefront"" of U.N. concerns about Libya's civilian population, Valerie Amos, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the Security Council on Monday. Two months of fighting and the ongoing shelling of the city's port has prevented aid ships from docking there, and between 150 and 300 non-Libyans are still waiting to be evacuated, she said. ""Some people are running short of food, water and other basics,"" she said. ""Medical facilities need supplies and more trained personnel."" The Security Council voted in March to authorize the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi's regime. Nearly 750,000 people have fled the country, another 58,000 are displaced within Libya and another 5,000 are stranded at border crossings into Libya, Tunisia and Niger, Amos said. For those who remain, Amos said the fighting and the sanctions imposed on Gadhafi and his allies have caused ""a severe disruption of supply lines within the country."" The results have been ""shortages of fuel, difficulties in obtaining commodities including foodstuffs, medicines and other essential goods, and there have been severe cash shortages throughout the country."" Western Libya has about three months' supply of food remaining; the mostly rebel-held east has about two months, she said. Fuel and supplies for desalinization plants and other facilities that provide fresh water to many Libyans ""are running out,"" she added. There have been widespread assumptions among experts that the conflict between pro- and anti-Gadhafi forces will continue to be a stalemate for some time. As time wears on, though, human rights groups have expressed growing concern for besieged Libyans in Misrata. The wounded arriving in Benghazi, the rebel hub city, painted a gruesome picture of the fighting in Misrata. Hanan Muhammad, who was evacuated along with about 800 others on an aid ship charted by the International Organization for Migration, was wounded when a missile struck near her home. ""I was in my house praying when the first missile landed. Shortly after, more missiles, one after another started hitting our neighborhood,"" said Muhammad, who suffered a broken arm and shrapnel wounds. ""Terror. Fear. People are scared every moment of the day no matter their age,"" she said. ""Oh God, it's like a horror movie."" Al-Neairy, who suffered facial burns and shrapnel wounds, said he does not regret fighting. ""The price for freedom is high and it (is) necessary to be liberated from this regime,"" he said. Amnesty International has said Gadhafi's attacks in the port city may amount to war crimes. A report issued last week by the monitoring group accused pro-Gadhafi forces of the ""unlawful killing of civilians due to indiscriminate attacks, including use of heavy artillery, rockets and cluster bombs in civilian areas and sniper fire against residents."" ""I'm not going to guess about a timeline. I want a solution sooner rather than later,"" Rasmussen said. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Sara Sidner and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","NEW: NATO jets hit Tripoli late Monday and early Tuesday .

1268,"(CNN) -- Firefighters made inroads into the massive wildfire in eastern Arizona Sunday, as authorities said the threat of spreading flames had decreased enough to allow thousands of residents in some of the hardest-hit areas to return home. ""After consulting with fire officials, it has been determined that the fire risk has diminished enough that it will no longer be a threat to the citizens of the towns,"" said Cmdr. Webb Hogle of the Apache County Sheriff's Office. But he said smoke from the wildfire ""still poses serious health hazards"" in Springerville, Eagar and South Fork, where authorities expect thousands to return home after evacuating. ""If they return, they do so at their own risk,"" he added. The 15-day-old blaze in eastern Arizona was 10% contained, fire officials said Sunday evening, up from 6% late Saturday. Still, the wildfire inched closer to becoming the worst fire in the state's history. The second-largest blaze had scorched 443,989 acres, firefighters said Sunday, an area bigger than most of the largest cities in the United States. The so-called Wallow fire is 24,649 acres shy of matching the Rodeo/Chediski wildfire of 2002, Arizona's biggest. Firefighters said they are making progress as they dig trenches, set their own fires to take away natural fuels from the advancing blaze and dump retardants from the air on the flames. It ""has been chasing us around, but after today we're feeling very optimistic,"" Jerome MacDonald, operations chief for the Southwest Interagency Incident Management team fighting the fire, told reporters late Saturday. The fire broke out May 29 in the Apache National Forest. Air quality for much of New Mexico and eastern Arizona was expected to worsen because of wildfires, the New Mexico health and environment officials said. Heavy smoke could affect those in sensitive groups, including children, pregnant woman, asthma sufferers and people with lung and heart diseases, the New Mexico Environment Department said. The National Weather Service said smoke plumes from Arizona wildfires will continue moving toward Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Heavy smoke has permeated communities around the Arizona blaze. ""We have not seen the sun clearly for several days,"" said Rita Baysinger, a spokeswoman for the Southwest Interagency Incident Management team. MacDonald said changing winds are likely to start clearing out the smoke. ""All the smoke from the fire has basically been funneling through Eagar in the valley and it settles there in the morning,"" MacDonald said. ""I don't expect the same kind of smoky conditions over the next couple of days."" At least 9,114 people were evacuated from Springerville, Eagar, Nutrioso, Alpine, Greer and surrounding areas. The wildfire has consumed 29 homes, 22 of them in the evacuated city of Greer.

1269,"Memphis, Tennessee (CNN) -- The Mississippi River is cresting at Memphis, forecasters said Tuesday, as attention began turning to flooding concerns in Louisiana and Mississippi. The slow passing of the bulge of water working its way from north to south along the Mississippi is only the beginning of the end of the siege for Memphis residents, who could be dealing with high water levels into June. And the struggle is just getting started for residents of Mississippi and Louisiana, where the river is expected to rise over the next few days to levels unseen since 1927. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal predicted Tuesday that as many as 3 million acres of his state could be affected by the flooding. As has been the case upriver from Missouri south to Tennessee, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is predicting its system of levees and flood walls will hold, keeping the river from inundating the small towns and farms that line its banks. ""The system is under stress. It has been under significant stress all along. However, it is operating as designed and intended,"" said Memphis District Readiness Branch Chief Steve Barry. ""The time of greatest concern has passed. We're in a stable situation,"" he said about the area around Memphis. In Tunica, Mississippi, where the river was inching toward a 48-foot crest Tuesday evening, county spokesman Larry Liddell said there's not much anyone can do. ""We're just watching and waiting,"" he said. About 600 people in the Tunica community of Cutoff have been driven from their homes, Liddell said. Some of the city's casinos also have water in them, but no one is sure how much, he said. Downstream in Louisiana, the Corps said it was closing a major lock that allows for the transfer of barge traffic between the Mississippi and the Red River Basin. The Corps also opened 44 more gates to the Bonnet Carre spillway in Norco, Louisiana, on Tuesday, sending millions of gallons of water rushing into Lake Pontchartrain and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico. The Corps opened 28 gates on Monday and may consider opening an additional 38 on Wednesday, according to Jefferson Parish President John Young. The spillway was diverting the equivalent of nearly 50 Olympic-sized swimming pools from the Mississippi each minute, according to Corps statistics. The agency is also considering opening a second spillway -- the Morganza Spillway -- that could flood populated areas. The wait for whatever is going to happen is causing anxiety among residents. They've been posting on Facebook pages operated by the Corps, demanding answers about if and when the Morganza Spillway will be opened and what other areas might be flooded. The spillway is on the Mississippi River north of Baton Rouge. Opening that spillway would send water into the Atchafalaya Delta to the west and south of Baton Rouge. A decision about whether to open the spillway is expected within the next 48 hours, according to Col. Ed Fleming, commander of the Corps' New Orleans District. If that second spillway is opened, Jindal predicted that roughly 2,500 people and 2,000 structures would be at risk directly inside the floodway. Another 22,500 people and 11,000 structures would be affected by backwater flooding, he said. The river in Memphis measured 47.81 feet as of 1 p.m. Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service, which had not yet reported an official crest. Water levels could fall or rise slightly, said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. ""This is a long process that has small peaks and valleys,"" she said. A crest is defined as the high point of the water during a flood before it begins to recede. Observers generally know that cresting is occurring when the gradual rise stops and the water level becomes stable. The Mississippi is the highest it's been at Memphis since 1937, when it crested at 48.7 feet -- 14.7 feet above flood stage. That flood killed 500 people and inundated 20 million acres of land, said Col. Vernie Reichling, the Corps of Engineers Memphis District commander. So far, the levees protecting the area have only shown minor weaknesses, which workers have been able to control, he said. The river covered the lowest parts of the city's historic Beale Street and had already forced about 400 people from their homes Monday, Memphis Mayor A.C. Wharton Jr. said. Another 1,300 remained in low-lying areas, he said. One of the Memphis residents in peril was Latisha Bowles. Her neighborhood had been swallowed by floodwaters but so far, her home was the last one at the waters' edge. ""It wants to come up here, but I've been praying every day it don't,"" Bowles told CNN affiliate WMC Monday.  ""I got three kids, and I'm not ready to move out of my house over this."" President Barack Obama signed disaster declarations for Tennessee on Monday and Tuesday, which will help direct federal aid toward recovery efforts in areas hit by severe storms, flooding and tornadoes since April and continuing. Although the river was cresting, Reichling warned Memphis residents not to assume everything will soon return to normal. ""The flooding is going to stay,"" he said. ""This river is not going to drop below 47 (feet) until early next week at the earliest. And that means all the tributaries that flow into this are going to stay high."" Flooded areas in Tennessee could turn into ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which can transmit West Nile virus and other diseases, the Tennessee Department of Health warned. The Mississippi State Department of Health said people in flooded areas could be at greater risk for tetanus. Once past Tennessee, the crest will next target Louisiana and Mississippi, where residents and authorities continued preparations for river levels that could break records set in 1927, when flooding displaced 600,000 people and caused the equivalent of nearly $624 million in damages, according to the National Weather Service. Forecasters don't expect anywhere near that kind of flooding, in large part because of the network of levees built after that disaster. Some 500 National Guard members have been mobilized for the flooding event so far, Jindal said. The river's crest was expected to begin arriving in Louisiana next week. So far, 21 parishes have issued emergency declarations, Jindal said. Flooding is the last thing needed in southern Louisiana, which is still recovering from Hurricane Katrina, said Lynn Magnuson, a New Orleans resident who submitted footage of the flooding to CNN iReport. ""I went through Katrina,"" Magnuson said. ""I would not wish flooding on anyone, and this city is the last place on Earth that needs any more high water."" U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, echoed that thought. ""After hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike -- as well as the oil spill -- Louisiana can ill-afford another large-scale disaster. Billions of dollars in property is at stake, not to mention the threat to human life,"" she said. Flooding also continued to be a problem in southeastern Missouri and southern Illinois, even though the Mississippi and Ohio rivers have already crested in those states. Last week, the Corps intentionally breached a levee in Missouri as part of its effort to reduce the pressure on other levees, flooding 130,000 acres of agricultural land over the objection of state officials and some farmers. The latest flooding in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys is largely the byproduct of torrential rains throughout the region. Over one two-week stretch, there was about 600% more precipitation than usual, forecasters said. Current weather finally appears to be working in the flood fighters' favor. Only minimal rain is expected over the coming days, with daytime temperatures forecast to be in the upper 80s and 90s through Thursday.

1270,"(CNN) -- Confusion and then an uneasy calm. That's how residents up and down the East Coast described their reaction to the 5.8-magnitude earthquake that rattled millions of people Tuesday. The quake, which struck at 1:51 p.m., was shallow -- just 3.7 miles deep. The epicenter was about 40 miles northwest of Richmond, Virginia, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It sent tremors throughout the region, surprising people at least as far away as New York, Ohio and Georgia. Sarah Merz said her co-worker in Camden, New Jersey, was the first one to notice the rumbling. ""She said, 'What is that? Is it a train?' Everyone kind of started looking at each other. Everyone's eyes just kind of widened, and we all just ran to the front door."" People stood stunned outside for a few minutes, she said. ""All of the sudden your heart starts to pound because you know on the East Coast, this just doesn't happen. It made me nervous at first, but then at the same time it's kind of this crazy curiosity."" Even an hour after the quake, Merz, 28, said she still felt dizzy. ""You're like, wait, am I moving? You keep second-guessing yourself. ... You start thinking too much. You're like, is it happening again?"" When she sat down at her desk, Merz noticed her framed college diploma was still vibrating on the wall. Stories like hers poured in from across the East Coast as residents, generally not used to earthquakes, struggled in the early moments of the temblor to understand what was happening. Was is a helicopter? A truck? A train? Kate Duddy was in an office building elevator in Manhattan, alone, when the shaking started. ""I have never felt a quake before. It was scary having no idea what the cause was,"" she said. ""I felt the vibrations and the elevator stopped for a period of about five minutes."" Gabby Randle, 23, was in a meeting in an office building at New York Avenue and 15th Street in Washington. ""We could see a couple of things falling off of the building next to us,"" she said. ""We sort of ran because the ceiling tiles were swaying."" An official who works in a federal building in New York said he thought someone was ""playing a joke"" on him when his desk started shaking. ""And then,"" he said ""I felt my whole body swaying and realized it was something much more."" Many buildings were evacuated in the U.S. capital, where huge crowds lined the streets as police cars sped by with sirens sounding. CNN iReporter Susan Prahinski sent CNN images of her home office in Washington. The quake knocked shelves off her walls and sent books and her computer monitor crashing. A statue of the Greek philosopher Aristotle lost its head. In Spotsylvania, Virginia, Tish Walker said she grabbed her dog and raced outside when the earthquake struck. ""I used to live in California, so I know shaking and this felt big,"" she said. ""My first thought is always that the furnace might explode or a cabinet crashes down on top of us."" Courtney Thompson, a CNN iReporter from Lanoka Harbor, New Jersey, had no doubt it was a quake, either. The question for her was whether it had occurred out in the ocean. She said everyone taking in the sun at Ortley Beach, New Jersey, sprang up at the same time and looked anxiously out to the Atlantic. ""The water did not recede (a telltale sign of an impending tsunami), but I'm sure that's what everyone was worried about,"" she said. ""People started panicking. They didn't tell us we had to get off the beach, but I'm telling you, everyone got right off the beach."" Brendan Wein, a sales representative at Hoffman Nursery near Rougemont, North Carolina, said he first sensed rattling inside the building. ""We were thinking it was a helicopter,"" Wein said. ""I was literally shaking in my chair."" Simon Griffiths, in Raleigh, North Carolina, compared the quake to a tractor-trailer truck roaring outside his house. Billy Wray said his guitars are OK, but things felt pretty weird when the bank building that houses his music shop in Mechanicsville, Pennsylvania, started to sway. ""Over here, we were rocking and rolling,"" he said. CNN iReporter Jeff Yapalater said he was in his backyard in New York's Long Island when the shaking started. ""Suddenly I felt this light swaying of the earth, I'd never felt that before, so I thought maybe I was experiencing vertigo for a moment, and it lasted maybe 30 seconds. ... We're feeling this really far away!"" he wrote. CNN's Susan Candiotti came across a couple waiting to get back into an evacuated courthouse, where they had been waiting to be married when the quake struck. ""I didn't feel the shaking at all,"" the groom said. He glanced over to his fiancee and joked, ""Maybe it's a sign."" CNN's Philip Gast, Katy Byron, Brian Walker and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","The quake, near Washington, sends tremors as far away as North Carolina .

1271,"(CNN) -- Unknown gunmen fired into a crowd of people outside an elementary school in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, Wednesday afternoon, killing one person and injuring four others, a Juarez municipal police spokesman said. ""A group of unknown gunmen were chasing down a target who ran to the Ricardo Flores Magon elementary school. He was with another woman, and they were being chased. The gunmen caught up to them outside of the school and fired into the crowd without caring about the people there,"" municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. School was in session at the time of the shooting at 2 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET), but none of the children were injured, Sanchez said. The students at the school are in the 10-to-11-year-old range, he said. It was their first week of classes. Journalists at the scene reported children witnessed the shooting. Teachers at the school did not want to talk to reporters, saying they were still in shock. Three women and one man were injured, including the woman who was accompanying the man targeted, Sanchez said. The women who were shot were waiting for their children outside of the school. There was no indication any of the victims were involved or connected to drug trafficking, but that was part of the municipal police investigation, Sanchez said. The suspects are still on the loose. The gunmen were seen traveling in a Volkswagen Jetta carrying AK-47s, witnesses to the incident told CNN. Drug traffickers in Mexico have a reputation for prefering AK-47s. Earlier this week, the Chihuahua state government said that 225 women have been murdered in Juarez this year. Ciudad Juarez is across the border from El Paso, Texas, and has been the scene of some of Mexico's worst violence in recent years.

1272,"Washington (CNN) -- The Washington Monument was closed indefinitely as engineers study damage and ways to repair cracks at the top of the capital's iconic structure caused by the 5.8-magnitude earthquake that rattled the East Coast this week. Tuesday's quake caused a 4-foot crack in the pyramidion at the top of the 555-foot obelisk and several pieces of mortar fell inside the monument's observation area during the earthquake, a National Park Service spokesman said. An outside structural engineering firm is conducting a thorough damage assessment, and the monument may not be reopened to the public until after any necessary repairs are completed, the spokesman added. ""It could be awhile and the most important thing is the visitors' safety is key, is paramount, is chief and we're not going to risk anyone going in and becoming injured,"" National Park Service spokesman Bill Line said. The Washington National Cathedral also was closed after sustaining what its staff described as ""substantial damage,"" including cracks in the building's limestone blocks and broken pinnacles on its towers. Most federal buildings and monuments in Washington have reopened, including the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials.

1273,"Washington (CNN) -- A bomb threat made at an airport ticket counter in Dayton, Ohio, prompted a search of a US Airways flight that landed safely at Washington's Reagan airport Sunday, authorities said. A law enforcement official said Sunday afternoon that no explosives have been found and the scene is now clear. The woman who made the threat in Ohio, who was taken into custody, may have mental health issues, the official said. Hours earlier, the FBI, Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration began probing reports of ""a bomb on board US Airways Flight 2596,"" FBI spokeswoman Lindsay Godwin said. The flight originated in Dayton and was closer to Washington when the threat was made, ""prompting officials to let the plane proceed,"" Godwin said. The US Airways flight departed on time, at 11:42 a.m., but landed about 30 minutes later than scheduled at 1:36 p.m., according to the airline's website. The plane was preparing to land when the airport was told to hold the flight, said Courtney Mickalonis, a spokeswoman for Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. Upon landing, the plane was directed to a remote runway and the 44 passengers were deplaned, Mickalonis said. US Airways spokeswoman Tina Swail said three crew members also had been aboard the CRJ 200 plane. A K-9 team alerted to a checked bag, TSA said, and local police are investigating. Kristin Lee, a Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman, said Sunday afternoon that the agency is ""aware of a verbal bomb threat."" All passengers safely were taken off, and the bomb squad swept the plane, she said in an e-mailed statement. Video showed luggage scattered on ground around the runway just outside the aircraft. One person dressed in bomb squad gear opened and looked at the bags, one by one. Other aircraft could be seen taking off from the airport. But US Airways' express flights -- like the one from Dayton -- are experiencing delays as a result of the incident, airline spokeswoman Tina Swail said. The plane's passengers, meanwhile, were being questioned by FBI investigators, Mickalonis said. CNN's Jonathan Helman, Mike M. Ahlers, Carol Cratty and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","NEW: The woman who made the threat may have mental issues, an official says .

1274,"Abuja, Ni(CNN) -- At least 18 people were killed in a bombing at a U.N. building in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, a police spokesman said Friday. Police commission Michael Zuokumo told reporters eight people had been injured. Rescue officials are at the scene helping to pull people from the rubble. Bomb squad officers and other security teams were sent to the scene, deputy police spokesman Yemi Ajayi said. A representative for the National Hospital said there was a shortage of blood to use in surgery. Hospital staff and relatives of the injured are currently going to the blood bank to donate. The hospital has called in all doctors and nurses who were not working Friday to deal with the emergency, the spokeswoman said, as ambulances brought people in. A witness outside the building at the time of the attack told CNN she had seen a white SUV drive through the main gate of the compound quickly. She then heard two explosions in quick succession, the second one much larger and followed by the shattering of glass, before running to safety. Alessandra Vellucci at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland confirmed that the ""U.N. premises in Abuja have been bombed"" but was unable to give more details. The building is home to the main U.N missions operating in Nigeria and may have had as many as 400 people inside. Eyewitnesses in the U.N. building told CNN there was an explosion, then an internal wall fell on some people, causing several casualties. Abdulkadir said it appeared that a car bomb had gone off at the front of the building, causing a wall to cave in. He said the area was not very busy because it was a diplomatic district, with the Liberian and U.S.embassies nearby, but that there were people working there. A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Abuja, Deborah MacLean, told CNN that there had been no damage to the embassy building, which is half a mile from the U.N building. Embassy personnel were initially told to be careful in case of further violence, she said. Zoran Jovanovic, head of mission for the International Red Cross in Abuja, said the explosion was heard at 10:15 a.m. local time. The U.N. building was in a large compound that had five gates, Jovanovic said, adding that the area was also home to western African embassies. It is not yet clear who was responsible for the attack. The Nigerian capital has seen a series of bombings recently. In June, a car blast killed at least five people at the police headquarters in the city. It detonated less than two minutes after the federal police chief entered the building, a security source said at the time. A month later, at least three people died in an explosion near a church outside the capital. The number of casualties could have been higher if services were still going on, according to a police spokesman. In October, at least 12 people died when car bombs exploded as the nation celebrated 50 years of independence. The attacks near the Justice Ministry injured about 50. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta claimed responsibility for the October attack. MEND, an umbrella organization of several rebel groups, is battling the government for fairer distribution of oil wealth. Recent attacks, including on the church and police station, may have been the work of a radical Muslim sect, Boko Haram, the nation's officials said this year. Boko Haram aims to enforce a strict version of Sharia law in the nation. Africa's most populous nation is divided between a largely Christian south and a Muslim north.

1275,"Moscow (CNN) -- Officials searched for answers Tuesday after a Russian jetliner made a premature descent and burst into flames in the country's northwest, killing 44 people and injuring eight others. ""I do not want to prejudge the investigation and all that but preliminary information suggests an obvious pilot error in poor weather conditions,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov, the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency reported. Investigators recovered the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder from the site of the crash, according to the Investigative Committee probing the crash. The cause of the premature descent is being investigated by the Inter-State Aviation Committee and the so-called black boxes will be recovered and sent to Moscow for deciphering, said Russian Deputy Transport Minister Valery Okulov on Russian state TV. The recorders will help authorities piece together the final minutes of the flight and possibly tell investigators what caused the plane to go down. ""Seems that he had been visually looking for the runway but couldn't see it,"" Ivanov said. The dead included 36 Russians, four people with joint U.S.-Russian citizenship, a Swede, a Dutchman and two Ukrainians, according to the Transport Ministry. Of the injured, five are in critical condition, according to regional authorities in Petrozavodsk. Some will be transported to Moscow for medical treatment. President Dmitry Medvedev expressed his condolences in the aftermath and has sent Transport Minister Igor Levitin to the scene on a fact-finding mission. The families of the dead will receive 1 million rubles ($35,500), while the families of the injured will be compensated 500,000 rubles ($17,750), according to the authorities. The jet with 43 passengers and a crew of nine took off Monday night from Moscow for Petrozavodsk, about 950 kilometers (600 miles) to the north. Controllers lost contact with the twin-engine Tupolev-134 about 11:40 p.m. (3:40 p.m. ET), and it crashed onto a highway outside Besovets, near the Petrozavodsk airport, the ministry reported. ""The first thing that the plane had contact with was a pine tree of about 15 meters high,"" said Alexander Neradko, head of the Russian Federal Aviation Agency on Russian state TV. ""This proves that the plane didn't break in mid-air but that all those destructions were inflicted to it as a result of that contact,"" he said. Nearly 140 rescue workers, doctors and police officers were on the scene before dawn Tuesday. Forensic experts have been dispatched to the crash site to help with identification of the bodies, regional authorities said.

1277,"(CNN) -- Everyone on the East Coast knew Thursday that monstrous Irene, energizing over bathtub-warm ocean waters, was heading toward them, posing the biggest hurricane threat to the United States in six years. What they did not know was the exact path of the storm. So people along a 700-mile stretch of the Atlantic Seaboard were, as North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue put it, preparing for the worst and praying for the best. There was even a possibility that the storm, which could reach Category 4 status, could slam into Manhattan, causing concerns about soaring skyscrapers and underground tunnels. A state of emergency has already been declared in Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Delaware, Connecticut and parts of North Carolina in anticipation of Irene. Fears were perhaps greatest in North Carolina and Virginia and on the slivers of islands that extend off those coastlines, which could start feeling Irene's punch by Friday evening. On North Carolina's Ocracoke, there is only one way off the island -- by ferry. The county ordered tourists and residents to evacuate. Bobby Hill, the emergency manager for the North Carolina Ferry Division, said more than 1,500 people left Wednesday. The ferries are operating all day Thursday, he said, but the last chance for anyone to get off the isolated, skinny island sticking out in the Atlantic, is one boat Friday morning. After that, well, you are out of options. Clayton Gaskill was one of about 100 Ocracoke residents still around Thursday night. In between playing progressive rock songs on community radio WOVV-FM, he talked about residents making final preparations. ""You pick up stuff that will float."" ""This is a little more serious than many of them,"" Gaskill said, referring to other storms in the region. Isabel in 2003 and Alex in 2004 did have significant impact. Residents have a couple grocery stores, ice and an emergency electrical source to help them ride out and recover from Irene. ""As long as the storm is in progress, you are on your own,"" Gaskill said. Hill has lived through 15 hurricanes in his lifetime: Floyd, Hazel, Connie, David. He's used to boarding up his home in coastal Beaufort and firing up the generator. You might call him a veteran. ""You're a veteran of one and they still keep coming,"" he said. Irene? Well, it will be another name on the long list. Janeen Wall has only one name in her hurricane memory. Floyd in 1999. ""It was scary,"" she said. So much so that Wall was not taking any chances. She arrived at her rented vacation condo on Carolina Beach just this Monday. But by Thursday, she was safely back home in Richmond, Virginia, buying extra bottles of water and gas for the grill, in case the power goes out. In Wilmington, North Carolina, Leigh Muscle planned a dream wedding for Saturday -- along the Intracoastal Waterway, of course. ""Literally my first reaction was, 'Nooo!,'"" Muscle told CNN affiliate WWAY. She had planned to walk down the aisle in the front yard of her mother's house; the reception was to be in the back yard, along the water. ""As of now, it looks like it's just going to be a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind, and it just looks like we need to move the event from outside to inside, so that's what we're planning,"" Muscle said. She's hoping a perfect storm won't ruin her perfect day. On Nags Head, Leanne and Nathan Robinson, surfers since they were kids, hoped to ride a few waves like they do in every hurricane the North Carolina natives have lived through. The winds are too high during the hit, but the swell before and after the storm could be ideal. But this time, it's different. Not because Irene is so huge, or that she is eyeing the Outer Banks. But this time, the young couple owns a house. This time, they have a 2-year-old daughter to protect. If it looks like a direct hit, Leanne plans to evacuate with their child. Nathan will stay to look after the house and the surf shop that Leanne manages. ""We are going to wait until tomorrow afternoon to make a decision,"" Leanne Robinson said. In the meantime, they've brought in the tomato plants, picked up debris and tied down everything that needs to be secured. And they cut dead branches off the tall pines in their yard. Farther north in Lewes, Delaware, Georgia Tugend is planning to ride out the storm along with her husband, Dave, and dog, Barkley. ""Our plan is not to leave,"" Tugend said. ""Temporary shelters will not take the dog, and we feel that our house is elevated enough that we would avoid any possible storm surge."" Tugend, who lives about half a mile from the Delaware Bay, said she and her husband are securing several items in their yard, including outdoor furniture and a 14-foot aluminum boat. ""We're going to hope for the best as far as the cars go,"" she said, noting that they don't have a garage. Tugend said she plans to fill her tub with water, and may stock up on extra beer as well. ""We had some really bad storms this past fall and winter with gusts clocked up to 70 miles per hour. We know we can get through that,"" she said. ""But you don't want to get cocky. If we get 100-mile per hour winds, that's a different ballgame. We've never lived through that."" In nearby Dewey Beach, 71-year-old Allan Lynch was taking steps to protect his restaurant, The Captain's Table. Lynch, a lifelong resident of the area, is planning to cover all of the windows at the restaurant, take down loose signs outside and bring in his trash cans. Lynch said he will probably close his business. He's also bringing in a supply of dry ice to help preserve the restaurant's food in case power is lost. As for himself, Lynch said he would probably ""go inland a little bit"" and seek shelter with his 90-year-old mother if the storm becomes severe enough. Lynch's wife stocked up extra milk, water and batteries. Some described their preparations as ""minimal,"" such as Nathan Nickerson in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. But ""I've got my chainsaw sharpened, and I've got my tractor ready to clear the way"" if there are a lot of downed trees, he said. Nickerson predicted that traffic at his business -- Arnold's Lobster and Clam Bar in Eastham -- will ""probably drop off to nothing, at least temporarily."" But the place will stay open as long as it can, Nickerson said. Thursday, he was already taking down several awnings, tents, and umbrellas. If nothing else, he joked, he would hold Arnold's annual employee party during the storm. Meanwhile, the owner of Alex's Bait & Tackle at Point Pleasant Beach in New Jersey said he's preparing for the worst. He's going to put as many as 150 sandbags in front of his water's edge store. ""I will stay here as long as I can,"" Marc Palazzo said. ""Most storms I ride out, but for the first time in 15 years I'm thinking of not riding this one out. ""I think the storm will head right up the Jersey shore at this point,"" he said. ""And locally, I don't think we're prepared. Nobody's boarding up anything, and there could be some major devastation."" Stores even farther north in New Hampshire were also gearing up for Irene. The emergency display was up at the Home Depot in Manchester, reported CNN affiliate WMUR. Generators. Flashlights. Backpack survival kits. And extra supplies of sump pumps. Peter Hoiries, who works for a restoration company, warned residents of Irene's strong winds. ""Standard shingles used in the New England area are good only for 75 miles per hour,"" he said. Older ones could blow off in even lighter winds. In Horseneck Beach, Massachusetts, the sun beat down Thursday. No sign of Irene yet, but people asked: ""What if?"" Boat owners in Falmouth Harbor began removing their vessels, according to CNN affiliate WHDH. Some people find it exciting, the prospect of a hurricane -- generally thought of as a Southern thing -- heading to New England. But veterans were quick to say ""beware."" ""They're exciting until they get a week into not having hot water, refrigerator, running around for ice and no electric power,"" said Bruce Crenshaw, a charter boat captain. ""The excitement wears off quick."" The reality is that many folks on the East Coast were still in a wait-and-see mode Thursday, as Irene -- slowly but surely -- made her way toward them.

1278,"Washington (CNN) -- Just days after a magnitude 5.8 earthquake cracked the Washington Monument in four places, the National Park Service is trying to protect it from being further damaged by Hurricane Irene, spokeswoman Carol Johnson said Friday. Engineers for the National Park Service are working inside the Washington Monument to ""plug holes and catch anything that they can't plug,"" Johnson told CNN. ""We have a group of people who are on ropes up there, trying to pin and plug whatever they can."" The engineers are using a flexible insulation called backer rod. ""They are basically jamming it into the cracks,"" Johnson said. ""They are doing what they can and putting this backer rod in and then they are going to go back up and inspect after the storm,"" she added. One area of special concern -- the most extensive damage to the stonework near the top caused by Tuesday's earthquake. ""The crack is about 4 feet long and 1 inch wide and in some places wider and you can see sunlight through the crack,"" Johnson said. The monument is closed indefinitely to the public while engineers assess the damage caused by the quake. Even without the new cracks, the monument would have experienced seepage because of the way it was built, according to Johnson. ""The anticipation is there will be more water because of these cracks. These cracks allow the water to get directly through and that is why we are doing everything we can to put in temporary waterproofing,"" Johnson said. However, the water is not expected to compromise the stability of the structure, she said. The first rain bands from Hurricane Irene began hitting the South and North Carolina coasts Friday. The storm is expected to near the D.C. area Saturday night into Sunday.","Park service engineers are using flexible insulation to fix cracks caused by quake .

1279,"(CNN) -- A poultry facility in southwest Missouri was quarantined after the discovery of a suspected case of bird flu, officials said. ""As a precaution, the poultry facility has been quarantined following preliminary results obtained during routine testing,"" the Missouri Department of Agriculture said in a news release. Additional tests will authenticate the viral disease at the Polk County facility, the state said Wednesday, adding that it is extremely rare for humans to be affected by this type of bird flu. Cargill Corp. will euthanize up to 15,000 younger birds exposed to older turkeys that tested positive for bird flu antibodies, said Mike Martin, director of communications for the company. Martin said Thursday the older birds are being harvested at another Missouri location. Their meat poses no health risk, he said. Flocks within six miles of the facility are being tested. Test results may be back as early as Friday, Cargill said. ""At the time the tests were conducted, the birds had no symptoms of the avian influenza. However, the antibodies mean at some time, the animal immune systems responded to the avian influenza,"" Martin said. ""The flu could have been present in the water, ground, air or transmitted by other migrating birds."" Cargill owns the birds but uses the farm under a contract, he said. ""This flu is not transferable to humans,"" Martin said. ""The real concern is for animals and the flu not being spread to other animal herds."" The U.S Agriculture Department is monitoring the situation.","Probable case of bird flu found during routine testing at southwest Missouri facility .

1280,"(CNN) -- A virulent strain of E. coli that has killed 18 people in Europe has not affected produce in the United States, according to food safety and health officials who conceded Friday there's much to learn about the organism. Even as efforts continue to determine what caused the outbreak, cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce imported from Germany and Spain will be tested and cleared before they are sold in the United States, according to David Elder of the Food and Drug Administration, and the results will be shared with the European Union. ""I want to emphasize that this outbreak has not affected the U.S.,"" Elder told reporters in a conference call. ""Produce remains safe, and there is no reason for Americans to alter where they shop, where they buy or what they eat."" Two adult women and an adult man who traveled last month to northern Germany remain hospitalized in the United States with hemolytic uremic syndrome -- a form of kidney failure -- said Chris Braden of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those three cases were reported in Massachusetts, Michigan and Wisconsin. A fourth person developed bloody diarrhea, but was not hospitalized, he added. Two U.S. service members in Germany also developed diarrhea, Braden said. ""We have no expectation that this will spread in our country."" The E. coli infection has spread to 12 countries and is blamed for at least 18 deaths -- all but one reported in Germany. About 1,800 people have been sickened. The European Food Safety Alert Network initially said enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), a strain of E. coli, was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to various countries. But authorities have said that the source of the contamination has not been pinpointed. The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal unit responsible for disease control and prevention, has advised German consumers not to eat raw tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce. Germany and Spain account for a small fraction of produce that is sold in the United States in a given year. Officials said tracking the source of the illness could be difficult. If it, in fact, stems from the produce, the tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce could have been eaten together in a salad. ""We don't know yet what is the cause and each of these (vegetables), individually or perhaps in some combination, appear as likely culprits, so I don't think we know enough to hypothesize at what point in the supply chain contamination may have occurred,"" said Don Kraemer of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ""We don't know which one that actually had the contamination in it."" The CDC is warning any U.S. citizens who have recently traveled to Germany to seek immediate medical care if they begin to show symptoms of the bacterial infection. Braden said officials were unable to identify the source for an outbreak of this E. coli strain in the republic of Georgia in 2009. The strain is more common among women and adults, he said, and officials are not certain how it may be associated with produce. ""We have a lot to learn about this particular organism,"" Braden said. The officials told reporters the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act signed by President Barack Obama this year provides steps that minimize the risk of E. coli at U.S. farms and production facilities. ""We believe prevention is superior to responding to an outbreak such as this one,"" Kraemer said.","Illnesses are traced to northern Germany .

1281,"Myth No. 1: A suntan's fine, as long as you don't burn. Reality: While even one sunburn may double the chance of eventually developing melanoma (the most serious type of skin cancer), your kids are still at risk even if they never burn. ""The more sun you get, the more likely you are to develop certain skin cancers,"" says Martin Weinstock, M.D., chairman of the American Cancer Society's Skin Cancer Advisory Group, no matter what your skin tone. ""Any tan indicates damage to your skin."" Myth No. 2: A beach umbrella blocks the sun. Reality: It's not foolproof. Sand reflects 17 percent of UV radiation, so you're still exposed, says Dr. Weinstock. Nevertheless, it's smart to stay in the shade when the sun's rays are high; just make sure you're also slathered with sunscreen. Myth No. 3: Sun can't penetrate through windows. Reality: Glass filters out only one kind of radiation -- UVB rays. But UVA rays, which penetrate deeper, can still get through. That's why many adults have more freckles on their left side than their right -- it's from UV exposure on that side through the car window when driving. To protect yourself, apply sunscreen to any exposed areas (like your hands, forearms, and face) before getting into your car, especially in the spring and summer months, says Anthony Mancini, M.D., head of pediatric dermatology at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. If you're buying a new car, consider one with tinted windows, which keep out almost four times more UVA light than regular ones. You don't need to worry about putting on sunscreen when indoors unless you or your child spends most of your time near a window (for example, if your child's desk is right next to one). Parenting.com: TLC for sunburned skin . Myth No. 4: Too much sunscreen causes vitamin D deficiency. Reality: You may have read that extra exposure to sunshine is needed to help your body make vitamin D. But according to the ACS, the American Academy of Dermatology, and the Skin Cancer Foundation, both kids and adults get plenty of this nutrient through multivitamins, vitamin D--rich foods (like milk and fortified orange juice), and everyday sun exposure. Also, even if you're wearing sunscreen, small amounts of UV rays still penetrate your skin, and that's more than enough to help your body produce vitamin D. Parenting.com: Sun protection 101 . Myth No. 5: If it's cool or cloudy outside, you don't need sunscreen. Reality: According to the Skind Cancer Foundation, up to 80 percent of the sun's UV rays can pass through clouds. This is the reason people often end up with serious sunburns on overcast days if they've spent time outside with no sun protection. Even in the winter months, you need to beware: Snow can reflect up to 80 percent of UV rays, increasing exposure. This is especially true if your family's on a ski vacation -- the higher your altitude, the greater your UV exposure. Parenting.com: Your print-and-save guide to warm-weather safety . Myth No. 6: 80 percent of sun damage occurs before age 18. Reality: Contrary to previous estimates, recent studies show that we get less than 25 percent of our total lifetime sun exposure before age 18. That means you get the majority of it later on. So while you absolutely should be vigilant about protecting your kids, make sure you take care of yourself, too. While 83 percent of parents arm their kids with sunscreen and protective clothing whenever they're outdoors, only two-thirds practice what they preach, according to a 2005 AAD survey. ""Remember, kids don't always pay attention to what you say -- it's more about what you do,"" says Dr. Weinstock. ""If you're making them wear sunscreen but baking yourself, you're sending them a mixed message they may carry into adulthood.""

1282,"(CNN) -- Two weeks after Haiti's devastating earthquake, Daniel Rouzier stood in front of heaps of bodies, dumped unceremoniously in the valleys of Titanyen. He clutched a mahogany rosary and covered his face with a sterile mask -- the stench of decomposing human flesh carried with the breeze. Rouzier, a wealthy businessman and executive with a notable charity had seen on CNN how earthquake victims had been trucked out of Port-au-Prince and disposed in Titanyen without burial. Upset, he put his own resources to work and hired bulldozers to dig mass graves for 2,500 bodies. He said then that it was sacrilege so many people had not been given proper internment. He didn't want to blame anyone for the aftermath of Haiti's tragedy; he was simply grateful to be able to help. Now, Rouzier stands poised to be able to do a lot more for his country. Haiti's new President Michel Martelly tapped the successful entrepreneur to become the troubled nation's next prime minister.  Unknown in Haitian politics, Rouzier at first was not even sure he wanted to enter a new realm. ""It was not in my cards at all,"" he said in a brief phone conversation in the midst of his confirmation hearings Thursday. ""But it is quite an opportunity to serve the people."" The ratification process before a parliamentary committee began Wednesday and is expected to go on for a few days. Rouzier said he hopes to be approved by next Tuesday. Martelly and Rouzier go way back. They went to the same high school and Rouzier's brother Fabrice Rouzier founded the Haitian band Mizik Mizik. Until recently, Martelly, of course, was better known as Sweet Mickey, a wildly popular bad boy of music. Martelly said he tapped Rouzier because the two men share a vision for a prosperous Haiti. ""Daniel Rouzier is a man of integrity,"" Martelly said. ""He has a track record of getting things done, he turns dreams into reality. Daniel is a man who will prioritize the interests of the country and will respect the rule of law."" A deeply devout Catholic, Rouzier said that if he is confirmed, he will serve in the prime ministerial post as a servant of God. He acknowledged that the journey ahead will be challenging. Haiti remains the poorest and least developed country in the Western hemisphere and is struggling to recover from the 2010 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and displaced 1.6 million others. Hundreds of thousands of those people are still eeking out existances in makeshift camps. The Inter-American Development Bank estimated that the cost of rebuilding homes, roads, schools and other infrastructure could be as much as $14 billion.The international community pledged $10 billion in March, 2010 but evidence of that money is scant. A year after the earthquake, there are still mounds of rubble stacked high in parts of Port-au-Prince. Haiti's problems were compounded by a cholera epidemic that erupted last  October and has resurged recently as the rainy season begins. Part of the reason Martelly won at the polls is because Haitians had increasingly grown discontent with the slow pace of recovery and reconstruction. Haitians said they wanted a fresh start. Rouzier adds to Martelly's credibility in that aspect, said Jocelyn McCalla, a Haitian-born political strategist and human rights expert. Rouzier also brings expertise both in the business world and in charitable work. He served as general manager of his family's Port-au-Prince car dealership, Sun Auto, and also spearheaded E-Power, a private plant intended to increase Haitians' access to electricity. That project was inaugurated on the first anniversary of the earthquake this past January. Rouzier also helped oversee Food for the Poor, a Florida-based Christian charity that is active in Haiti. Despite no political experience, Rouzier is seen as someone who can be fair, McCalla said. ""He has a good reputation,"" McCalla said. ""He strikes me as somebody who is well-intentioned."" But as with all others who have entered politics in Haiti, Rouzier will have to rise above entrenched corruption, McCalla said. If he becomes prime minister, Rouzier will inherit a government that was barely functioning, McCalla said. ""One of his challenges is to rebuild the government from the ground up,"" he said. Martelly has already promised a free and mandatory education for all Haitians, key to the Caribbean nation's development. The new president has also said he will not look so kindly on those who hinder much needed change. Rouzier, said McCalla, will help Martelly in challenging a mindset that has hindered Haiti in the past. ""There is so much to be done,"" Rouzier said. ""It's not going to be easy."" All those months ago, he had bestowed peace upon the souls of the dead. It may prove more difficult to do so for the living.","Entrepreneur Daniel Rouzier was tapped to be the next prime minister .

1283,"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama extended a helping hand to Japan on Friday as hundreds of people were dead and additional hundreds were missing after a devastating 8.9-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami. ""I offer our Japanese friends whatever assistance is needed,"" he said during a news conference. ""Today's events remind us how fragile life can be."" Obama said Friday that the main U.S. assistance to Japan for now would probably be ""lift capacity"" in the form of heavy equipment to help clean up damaged infrastructure. The U.S. government is taking inventory of how many military personnel are in Japan to provide help, he said, adding that American citizens in Japan will also receive assistance. Obama called the earthquake and tsunami ""a potentially catastrophic disaster,"" saying the images of destruction were ""simply heartbreaking."" At a session of the President's Export Council on Friday morning at the Old Executive Office Building, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about the U.S. delivering coolant to Japan for its nuclear reactors, CNN has confirmed. ""You know Japan is very reliant on nuclear power, and they have very high engineering standards. But one of their plants came under a lot of stress with the earthquake and didn't have enough coolant. So Air Force planes were able to deliver that. So we're really deeply involved in trying to do as much as we can on behalf of the Japanese and on behalf of U.S. citizens,"" she said. Neither the Air Force nor the Pentagon could confirm that U.S. Air Force planes delivered coolant to the Japanese power plant. Obama said he has been in touch with Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan about the potential vulnerability of any nuclear power plants in Japan. ""So far, they have not seen any evidence of a radiation leak, but obviously you have to take all potential precautions,"" Obama said. The president said he has spoken with his energy secretary, Steven Chu, ""to make sure that if in fact there have any breaches in the safety of the nuclear plant, they are dealt with."" Five U.S. Navy ships were heading to Japan, and two others were already docked in the country, according to the Pentagon. The State Department on Friday said there were no immediate reports of casualties among the tens of thousands of U.S. citizens -- tourists, military personnel and others -- in Japan. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington is in the maintenance yard in Japan and unable to get underway. Another nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan in the western Pacific, is the only carrier heading to Japan. ""We currently have an aircraft carrier in Japan, and another is on the way."" Obama said Friday. ""And we also have a ship en route to the Mariana Islands to assist as needed."" Among the 38,000 U.S. military personnel, 43,000 dependents and 5,000 Department of Defense civilians assigned to Japan, there are no reports of loss of life and no reports of major damage to U.S. warships, aircraft or facilities in Japan, said Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan. Obama was awakened at 4 a.m. ET with news of the disaster and received a briefing from his top security and emergency response advisers at 9:30 a.m., the White House said. In a statement, Obama sent his condolences to the people of Japan and declared that the United States stands ready to offer aid, citing the strong ties between the two nations. Obama also spoke by telephone with Kan, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said. Clinton pledged ""immediate disaster relief assistance"" and said ""we are working closely with the government of Japan to provide additional help,"" according to a State Department statement. Pentagon spokesman Lapan said Japan's foreign minister had formally asked the United States for help, launching the process of figuring out what is needed and what the U.S. military can provide. The State Department issued an alert against nonessential travel to Japan because of the earthquake and tsunami. The alert said that Tokyo airports were closed and others also may be closed or restricted, and that public transportation in Tokyo and other areas has been interrupted. The alert also said strong aftershocks were likely ""for weeks"" and included instructions for what to do if caught in another earthquake or aftershock. It urged U.S. citizens in Japan to contact family and friends to let them know of their well-being. Two U.S. airlines -- Delta and American -- announced the cancellation of flights to Tokyo. It was unclear if flights to other Japanese airports also would be affected. In addition, Delta, United and Continental airlines announced they were waiving change fees for people whose travel plans involving Japan were affected by the disaster. At the State Department, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Janice Jacobs said a 24-hour consular task force has been set up to help Americans affected by the earthquake. Americans in Japan who need help, or people seeking information about a loved one in Japan, can send an e-mail to japanemergencyusc@state.gov, Jacobs said. Americans outside Japan but in tsunami-affected areas who need help, or people seeking information about an American in affected areas outside Japan, can e-mail pacifictsunamiusc@state.gov, she said. A telephone information line also has been set up at 1-888-407-4747, said Jacobs, who encouraged people to use the e-mail options if possible. When seeking information about Americans in Japan or other affected areas, Jacobs said, provide the full name, birth date and location of the person, as well as any pre-existing medical conditions, and if they are elderly or a child. Obama, who was first informed of the earthquake before dawn by Chief of Staff Bill Daley, said he has instructed the Federal Emergency Management Agency ""to be ready to assist Hawaii and the rest of the U.S. states and territories that could be affected"" by tsunamis. ""The United States stands ready to help the Japanese people in this time of great trial,"" Obama said. Vice President Joe Biden, traveling in Moldova, called the disaster a ""mega-earthquake"" and said ""the thoughts and prayers of the American people ... are with our friends in Japan."" ""We the United States stand ready to do anything we can to help our Japanese friends as they deal with the aftermath of this tragedy,"" Biden said, according to a pool report of his remarks. CNN's Michael Martinez, Ed Henry, Barbara Starr, Elise Labott, Larry Shaughnessy and Bonney Kapp contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama says U.S. is monitoring Japanese power plant for radiation leaks .

1284,"(CNN) -- Joseph Maraachli, the infant whose family refused to accept a recommendation by a Canadian hospital to remove the boy's breathing tube and allow him to die, is now breathing on his own without the aid of a mechanical ventilator. The family flew back to their home in Windsor, Ontario, on Thursday, one month after receiving a tracheotomy at a children's hospital in St. Louis. ""By providing him with this common palliative procedure, we've given Joseph the chance to go home and be with his family after spending so much of his young life in the hospital."" said Dr. Robert Wilmott, chief of pediatrics for SSM Cardinal Glennon. The 15-month-old, widely known in the media as ""Baby Joseph,"" became the center of an international end-of-life debate when a London, Ontario hospital where he was receiving care for a progressive neurological disease refused to insert a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the airway through an incision in the neck and allows for suction of fluid out of the lungs. In court papers, doctors in Canada said there was no hope for recovery. They would not perform a tracheotomy because they considered it to be invasive and not recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine. The family refused to accept the recommendation. The Maraachlis' daughter, Zeina, had died at home in 2002 with a tracheotomy after suffering similar complications, and the family wanted to offer the same care to their son. The Maraachli case caught the attention of the group Priests for Life, which funded Joseph's transfer and treatment at the SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center. That hospital deemed the procedure medically appropriate and Baby Joseph underwent a tracheotomy there on March 21. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said he considers this a ""victory over the culture of death."" He says ""[Joseph] has gained benefit from his tracheotomy, is breathing on his own, and is going home to live with his parents."" Priests for Life is a Catholic pro-life organization which functions as a network to prevent abortion and euthanasia. They are often noted for the graphic images depicting abortion they use to make their case. The London Health Sciences Centre -- the hospital where Maraachli was initially treated -- responded on March 23 that ""there are clearly differences in the approach of these centres to the management of end-of-life care in this tragic situation"" and that ""the medical judgments made by LHSC physicians remain unchallenged by any credible medical source."" On Thursday, the hospital said it ""has no new comments from those already provided in our previous media statements."" After arriving in Canada on Thursday morning, the child was examined by a team of physicians at the Windsor Regional Hospital to ensure no complications or infections resulted from the flight. According to the hospital's president and CEO, David Musyj, the Maraachlis are prepared to take care of their son, but they also will be provided round-the-clock nursing care in their home. A team of community care nurses will alternate shifts staying with the family. They will take the lead on daily requirements, to include cleaning the trach, tube feeding and administering anti-anxiety medications. The nurses will also monitor his heart rate, suction secretions that build up in his lungs and provide oxygen as needed. According to Musyj, the 24-hour nursing care, medications and all the equipment are provided free of charge under Canada's universal health care system. In the United States, hospice care is underutilized even though it tends to be less expensive than hospitalization and provides more comfort to the patient. Estimates find approximately 60% of all deaths occur in the hospital, yet most patients express a preference to die at home. It is unclear at this point just how much time the Maraachlis have left with their son. In a phone conversation, Pavone said Joseph's symptoms are much more benign than those suffered by his sister. ""It's really an unpredictable condition,"" he said. ""Our mission to save Baby Joseph was never based on any prediction of the future, but rather on the value of his life here and now.""","Joseph Maraachli suffers from a progressive neurological disease .

1285,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Five American service members were killed Thursday after an improvised explosive device detonated in southern Afghanistan, officials said. The attack occurred several days after 30 Americans died in a helicopter crash in central-eastern Afghanistan. That was America's worst single-incident loss of life since the war began. No other details were provided regarding Thursday's incident. On Wednesday, Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi told reporters that coalition forces had killed 189 militants in joint operations against Taliban insurgents across the country in the past three weeks. Azimi announced that 362 insurgents had been detained since July 23, as NATO and Afghan forces stepped up raids against Taliban strongholds. ""We've increased our efforts over the last several months,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Jimmie Cummings, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. ""The focus is to allow them to have less and less (in terms of) safe havens."" But a Taliban spokesman rejected the insurgent casualty figure cited by the Defense Ministry in what appears to be the latest example of coalition forces vying with insurgents in attempting to control information from the battlefield. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said fewer than 30 militants had been killed during that time, adding that the insurgency had stepped up its guerrilla tactics and mine attacks. Mujahid also rejected an earlier NATO statement that said coalition forces had killed insurgents responsible for the downing in eastern Afghanistan of a CH-47 Chinook helicopter that left 38 U.S. and Afghan personnel dead. He said a NATO airstrike killed a separate group of insurgents, while those responsible for Saturday's strike slipped into a separate Afghan province. He did not elaborate, and CNN could not independently confirm the claims. Al Jazeera aired Thursday video of what it said was wreckage of the helicopter. The video shows unspent shells; papers in English and rubble. ""These are the only pictures of the helicopter remains that NATO forces were not able to hide,"" the narrator says. ""It's apparent that the helicopter did not only fall, but it exploded and scattered."" Saturday's attack on the helicopter represented a major blow to America's most elite fighting unit: 17 U.S. Navy Seals were killed along with other special operations forces, Afghan commandos and a civilian translator. U.S. Special Operations Forces have conducted at least 2,500 raids by helicopter in the last year and Saturday's strike was the first during that time in which an aircraft supporting operations was lost, ISAF said. Meanwhile, the country faces looming questions over its long-term stability and the prospect of a resurgence by the Taliban as a security handover and NATO drawdown take place. But it remains unclear whether recent attacks by Taliban fighters represent newfound insurgent strength. In May, the Taliban launched what they called a Spring Offensive against Afghan and NATO forces, in a wave of attacks that has continued into late summer. But NATO forces, bolstered by last year's ""surge"" of 33,000 additional U.S. troops, say they have increased operations against Taliban safe havens, pushing insurgents from strongholds in the south and east. Meanwhile, 10,000 U.S. soldiers are scheduled to depart Afghanistan by year's end, with the full drawdown set for the end of 2014. Western diplomats, however, predict a NATO military presence will extend beyond the drawdown date.

1286,"(Health.com) -- Mercury exposure from eating fish doesn't appear to raise the risk of heart disease and stroke, as some research has suggested, according to a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study -- the largest of its kind to date -- should help settle long-standing uncertainty about whether mercury from fish, which in high doses is believed to cause developmental delays in fetuses and infants, might also impact the heart health of adults. ""This research provides really robust evidence that mercury exposure from fish consumption at levels commonly seen in [the] U.S. and similar countries is not linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,"" says Dariush Mozaffarian, M.D., the lead author of the study and an associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, in Boston. ""For the average consumer who's worried about mercury in fish, our study suggests that cardiovascular toxicity should not be a concern."" Health.com: 10 best foods for your heart . Not only is eating fish safe, but it's also good for your heart, thanks to its low levels of saturated fat and abundant omega-3 fatty acids. In the study, in fact, the participants with the highest mercury exposure appeared to be at slightly less risk of heart attack and stroke than those with the lowest exposure, a trend that is probably due to the benefits of fish consumption rather than the mercury itself, the researchers say. Fish ingest mercury, an industrial by-product, when it collects in rivers and oceans. Mercury levels tend to be more concentrated toward the top of the underwater food chain, as smaller fish (such as sardines and shrimp) are eaten by larger fish (such as swordfish and tuna). Fish-oil supplements, which many people take to promote heart health, have not been found to contain mercury, says Stephen Kopecky, M.D., a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn. Health.com: Supplements for cholesterol: what works? For years, health officials have warned pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children to limit their fish consumption due to concerns about the apparent link between mercury exposure and subtle delays in the brain development of infants and children. Neurological problems stemming from mercury-laden fish do not appear to be a concern for adults, but doctors have been less certain about the effects of mercury on heart health. Some experts have suggested, for instance, that mercury could affect heart health by interfering with heart function, promoting blood clots, or neutralizing antioxidants. To test this theory, Mozaffarian and his colleagues measured mercury levels in the stored toenail clippings of 3,427 people with a history of heart disease, heart attack, or stroke, and compared them with an equal number of demographically similar people without heart problems. (Toenail clippings are a common way of measuring mercury exposure.) Health.com: 10 healthy fish recipes . The participants, who were part of two long-running government studies known as the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, also answered detailed questions about their dietary habits. The average mercury concentrations were about the same in both groups, 0.23 versus 0.25 micrograms per gram. (By comparison, 0.4 micrograms per gram is considered the upper limit of safety for pregnant moms and infants.) The researchers found no relationship between mercury exposure and the risk of heart attack and stroke, even in people with mercury concentrations of up to 1 microgram per gram. ""Any way we looked at it, we found no evidence for higher risk,"" says Mozaffarian, who is also an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. In short, there is no reason to change the current dietary recommendations regarding fish and mercury, Kopecky adds. Health.com: Healthy fish choices . The American Heart Association generally recommends that people eat fish at least twice a week, limiting their consumption of large, predatory fish that might have higher mercury levels. The Food and Drug Administration, meanwhile, urges pregnant women and young children to eat no more than two servings of fish per week. These groups should stick with salmon, catfish, canned light tuna, and other low-mercury species, and should avoid high-mercury species altogether, the agency says.

1287,"(CNN) -- A furious Hurricane Irene exacted a heavy toll on North Carolina, claiming at least five lives, peeling siding off houses and plunging hundreds of thousands of homes in darkness. And yet, it could have been much worse, said the U.S. Coast Guard. ""All in all, the damage wasn't nearly as bad as we had expected,"" said Rear Adm. William Lee, who surveyed the coastline on a helicopter tour from Cape Lookout to Wilmington.  ""Very few trees were down. I saw evidence of minor flooding."" Three of North Carolina's deaths involved traffic wrecks during the storm.  Another person died when he was hit by a tree limb, while feeding livestock.  A fifth died of a heart attack as he was putting plywood over this windows ahead of the storm's arrival. Some 450,000 were without power early Sunday, officials said. Irene stomped across the state most of the day Saturday after a morning landfall near Cape Lookout at the southern end of the Outer Banks. The storm ripped shingles and siding off buildings in Atlantic Beach, knocked over a church steeple and flooded homes in low-lying areas.  At least 10 major roads were closed and airports were forced to shut down, Gov. Bev purdue said. The hurricane unleashed 10 to 14 inches of rain over much of North Carolina and pushed a 4-foot storm surge into the Chesapeake Bay, the National Hurricane Center said. As of midnight Saturday, Kill Devil Hills had endured 31 hours of nonstop rainfall. Firefighters waded through knee-high floodwaters as they responded to calls in the community. The nearby town of Wanchese was reported under water, officials said. In Duck, North Carolina, the storm pushed water from the Currituck Sound inlet out to the sea, said resident Gregg Nigro. ""Once the storm's eye passes and the wind shifts, we will see flooding and erosion,"" he said Saturday. In Greenville, Mike Sharpe woke to find water under his living room door. ""The front parking lot is just as flooded, and the cars have water up past their doors,"" he said. ""Everybody's a little worried. We didn't expect to have any flooding. That's something we weren't prepared for."" Glenn Williams watched the storm from his downtown Raleigh office. ""I just come down here in the hurricane because it's safer than it is at home where all the trees are at,"" he told CNN affiliate WRAL-TV. By early Sunday morning, Irene had hammered the state with 10 to 14 inches of rain. Through it all, residents maintained their good humor. In Kill Devil Hills, the boarded-up shop windows displayed spray-painted missives to Irene: ""I have enough women in my life, Irene,"" said one. ""No crabs for Irene,"" said another at a seafood shop. ""Don't be mean, Irene,"" said a third. In some areas, beachcombers looked for any shells Irene had deposited. Surfers reveled at their good fortune at Wrightsville Beach, taking advantage of the bigger waves dished up in the aftermath of the storm. ""It's the wind and the waves and the culture,"" Dane Reynolds telling WRAL why he was out in the post-storm surf.  ""It's all about the culture of the surf community.""","NEW:  Many Outer Banks communities are flooded .

1288,"Washington (CNN) -- Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington closed its doors Saturday, completing the military hospital's merger with the Bethesda National Naval Medical Center. The event was marked with a flag-lowering ceremony, which followed the transfer of Walter Reed's 18 remaining patients to the combined medical center's Bethesda, Maryland, campus. The official closing was conducted a day earlier than originally planned in order to avoid the worst of Hurricane Irene, but the ceremony was still marked by grey skies, heavy rain and strong winds. This somber weather caused Lt. Gen. Eric Schoomaker, the Army surgeon general, to remark in his closing speech, ""clearly the heavens are struggling with the finality of this too."" Despite the weather, a sizeable crowd of Walter Reed staff and military personnel attended the outdoor ceremony with their families. For many of them, the closure of the Walter Reed facility marks the end of an era. The hospital center has been in operation for more than a century and has provided medical care to many of the nation's wounded soldiers. It has also served as a leading center for medical research. The new combined facility, known as the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, is now the country's largest military medical center. It will be run jointly by the Army and the Navy.","Military hospital lowers its flag .

1289,"New York (CNN) -- The National Hurricane Center on Saturday warned residents of tall structures in the path of Hurricane Irene that the wind hitting upper floors will be stronger than those in most storms. ""As Irene moves through areas with high-rise structures, these structures will experience winds significantly stronger than indicated by the advisory intensity,"" forecasters said. ""Winds at the 30-story level will likely be 20% higher than at the surface. And winds 80-100 stories up could be about 30% higher than the surface."" Irene was expected to reach the New York metropolitan area Sunday at hurricane strength. Winds were at 80 mph Saturday evening. The center's analysis buttressed Mayor Michael Bloomberg's call for high-rise residents to stay away from windows if they live on the 10th floor or above. At the city's request, building owners were shutting down elevators Saturday. Reaching trapped residents would be a drain on police and fire who need to respond to ""real emergencies,"" Bloomberg added. In a hurricane the higher you go, the stronger the wind gusts. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said the higher friction at the ground surface slows wind speeds. According to the National Hurricane Center, forecasters started seeing the significant upper wind increase when the eye-wall collapsed over the Bahamas. They also noted that there was little thunderstorm activity associated with Irene. Thunderstorms tend to bring the higher winds down to the surface, and with the lack of such activity the stronger winds are staying at higher levels. As the storm re-emerges over the Atlantic late Saturday and moves northward, the colder waters also will aid in intensifying this effect. Construction workers had wind dynamics in mind while they secured One World Trade Center ahead of Irene's arrival. While the windows being installed on the soon-to-be tallest building in the U.S. are designed to withstand 125 mph winds, they're only in place up to the 52nd floor. Steel beams taking the place of the Twin Towers have risen to the 80th floor. The remaining upper floors are open to the elements. That's a serious concern because anything blown off a building from that height, even something as small as a bolt, can become a deadly projectile in a hurricane. ""They are very big on safety here,"" said Kelly Potts, an electrician working on One World Trade Center. ""If anything is not tied down they will address it and fix it."" The construction cranes high atop the World Trade Center site also were to be secured. They are designed to withstand strong winds. Construction workers on the site are well aware how serious high winds are at a skyscraper under construction. While the Time Warner Center was being built a few years ago at Columbus Circle in New York a plywood board was blown off the building. It struck a man below, killing him. Bloomberg also urged people not to have a generator inside their home or apartment because ""carbon monoxide fumes kill."" ""Homeowners and residents: If you haven't done so already, please bring outdoor furniture inside -- plywood, trash cans, any loose items that can blow around,"" he said. CNN Radio's Steve Kastenbaum contributed to this report.","Hurricane Irene will bring high winds to New York City on Sunday .

1290,"Tuscaloosa, Alabama (CNN) -- Almost nothing stood. Where the awful winds bore down, massive oaks, 100 years old, were shoved over like stems of grass, and great pines, as big around as 55-gallon drums, snapped like sticks. Church sanctuaries, built on the Rock of Ages, tumbled into random piles of brick. Houses, echoing with the footfalls of generations, came apart, and blew away like paper. Whole communities, carefully planned, splintered into chaos. Restaurants and supermarkets, gas stations and corner stores, all disintegrated, glass storefronts scattered like diamonds on black asphalt. It was as if the very curve of the Earth was altered, horizons erased altogether, the landscape so ruined and unfamiliar that those who ran from this thing, some of them, could not find their way home. Southern Living: Stories from the Storm . We are accustomed to storms, here where the cool air drifts south to collide with the warm, rising damp from the Gulf, where black clouds roil and spin and unleash hell on Earth. But this was different, a gothic monster off the scale of our experience and even our imagination, a thing of freakish size and power that tore through state after state and heart after Southern heart, killing hundreds, hurting thousands, even affecting, perhaps forever, how we look at the sky. But the same geography that left us in the path of this destruction also created, across generations, a way of life that would not come to pieces inside that storm, nailed together from old-fashioned things like human kindness, courage, utter selflessness, and, yes, defiance, even standing inside a roofless house. Southern Living: What Stands in a Storm: Fellowship . As Southerners, we know that a man with a chainsaw is worth 10 with a clipboard, that there is no hurt in this world, even in the storm of the century, that cannot be comforted with a casserole, and that faith, in the hereafter or in neighbors who help you through the here and now, cannot be knocked down. I know this to be true because I came home to it the day after the storm. My street, a quarter-mile of small, historic homes and lovely trees, had looked as though it were painted on canvas and hung on the air. It was ruined April 27, and also spared. No one died in Glendale Gardens, while, yards away in Rosedale, rescue workers pulled the dead from houses blasted as if in war. It is why, even as they piled their neighborhood into trash heaps two stories tall, my neighbors said, over and over, how fortunate they were. Our little white house, on the edge of a mile-wide tornado, was hammered by flying 2-by-4s, stripped of its shingles but, somehow, still standing when we returned from New Orleans. My wife, Dianne, cried when she saw it, and cried more as she looked down our street. A third of the houses were destroyed. Others will be torn down. The trees that gave this place its name were gone or splintered. In our yard, a single, ancient dogwood survived, my wife's pride, a reminder of what this used to be. People say it will never be the same. I don't know about that. How do you leave? It had been a bad spring. The sirens screamed every few days, in Mississippi, Alabama and beyond. In Tuscaloosa, just days before the big storm, Mary Kate Jemison Cochrane and her daughter, Emily, walked through the family house in Glendale, looking for a place the 91-year-old Mrs. Cochrane could shelter when the weather turned. They settled on a hall closet, removed two Electrolux vacuum cleaners, silent since antiquity, and put in a chair. When sirens did sound on April 27, Mrs. Cochrane stepped inside and shut the door. She passed the time by looking through things, forgotten and dusty. She picked up a cookie tin, and pried off the lid. Neatly rolled inside was her christening gown, the one she wore as a baby, almost 92 years ago. She had been looking for that. Southern Living: What Stands in a Storm: Faith . She is hard of hearing. Inside, with her memories, she did not hear the destruction. She felt the house shake, but it had shaken before. Then she heard someone calling her name. A neighbor, Michael Carr, had huddled as the storm tore at his walls. The first thing he did, when it passed, was break into her house, damaged but intact, and shout for her. It was the same all along the street, as people ran from house to house, shouting, hoping. Carr called for her again. The closet door swung open. ""Well I am fine, Michael,"" she said graciously, ""and you are just so kind, to come check on me."" She stayed here because it was where she raised her children, where she once found a live horse in a bedroom, where every cardboard box bulged with history. It took the storm of a lifetime to move her. She walked through the ruin, and rode away. But she sent Emily back for the gown. There will be great-grandchildren to baptize. They must be properly dressed. Outside, minutes after the winds died down, people gathered in the street. Tammy Elebash, our boy took her daughter to prom, held a phone. ""I see the Pitts ... I see the Petrovics ... yes, Mrs. Brannon is fine. She's on my arm. ..."" Inez Rovegno and John Dolly had grabbed their wedding album and crawled into the tub. Mary Pitts had hidden with her triplets in a hallway as flying glass stabbed the walls. Beverly Banks had held to her big, white dog as her house disintegrated around her. Then, one by one, people noticed the change. The once verdant place was laid open, stripped, flattened. You could see things you had never seen, like a water tower that used to be invisible behind the curtains of green. It was like the storm had picked these people up and set them down someplace ugly, broken, new. How awful it would have been, to have landed there alone. 'I always thought we lived on a good street. Now I know' I have seldom felt helpless in my life. I hold to the hillbilly standard that there is no situation so hopeless that, through perseverance, I cannot make worse. It is why my wife will not let me have a chainsaw -- ""You will cut off your own head"" -- and will not allow me on the roof. So there I stood, giant trees across my driveway, my roof naked, helpless. What happened next still seems like magic. Within a minute of stepping into my yard, I was met by a never-ending stream of neighbors, some I only slightly knew, who left their own crises to help me clean up mine. There are too many to list here -- I would leave someone out -- but they came, capable men who knew how to run a saw or twist a wrench. Some came, worked like a dog, and vanished before I could thank them. I hope they are reading this, men and women who lifted and dragged tons of trees, and almost killed me and my stepson Jake, trying to keep up. Every church group in Tuscaloosa, it seemed, clawed rubble out of my yard, or out of the playground across the street, meaning I can never again say anything mean about the Episcopalians. I came to enjoy the company. That first afternoon, I straightened up from tugging on an unmoving limb to see Allen McClendon, the husband of my son's music teacher, saw through a tree that blocked my drive. He brought his father, Rick, and an old, brown dog named B.J., and we told duck hunting stories and I don't think any lies, but it was hard to tell over the roar of the saws. And then they, too, were gone, to help someone else, somewhere down the road. Southern Living: What Stands in a Storm: Food . There was no end to this generosity. Food just appeared. No one would take a dime. The college students on our street, the ones I had yelled at for driving too fast, cooked all the meat from our melting freezers, and let me pet their puppy. Mrs. Cochrane's Emily asked if we needed a generator. Our boy's friends brought gasoline. Folks with gas water heaters offered hot showers. That night, I went to sleep under the luxury of an electric fan. The next morning, my neighbors were in my yard before I was. So I wonder. If a street is made of people, not oaks and tulip trees, how can this place not be as fine as it ever was? I think the best I heard it put was by Mary Pitts. ""I always thought we lived on a good street,"" she said. ""Now I know."" A few days after the storm, on a Sunday morning, I awoke to a tap-tap-tap on my roof. I should have gone to see what it was about, but after a while the rhythmic tapping got to be almost soothing, and I ducked inside a dream. Later, I learned that my neighbor James Mize had scaled the roof and tacked down some covering that had blown loose. He did not ask me where I went to church, or how I voted, or who my family was. He did not climb that ladder for money, or attention, or even thanks. He did it, he said, because it looked like rain. Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

1291,"Baghdad (CNN) -- A car bomb exploded outside a Catholic church in central Kirkuk, Iraq, early Tuesday, wounding at least 20 people, authorities said. The attack took place in Kirkuk's Shatterlo neighborhood around 5:30 a.m. (10:30 p.m. Monday ET), according to a police official who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The wounded included staff from the Holy Family Church and people with homes nearby. The Interior Ministry said 23 people were injured. The explosion damaged the church and a number of nearby houses, police said.  Kirkuk is an ethnically divided city located about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Baghdad. In the past years, extremists have carried out major attacks against churches. An October 31 attack on the Sayidat al-Nejat Cathedral, or Our Lady of Salvation Church, left 70 people dead and 75 wounded, including 51 congregants and two priests. The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes a number of Sunni Muslim extremist organizations and has ties to al Qaeda in Iraq, claimed responsibility for the Baghdad church siege. Religious minorities, such as Christians and Yazidis, make up less than 5% of Iraq's population, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Since 2003, attacks against these minorities by insurgents and religious extremists have driven more than half of the minorities out of the country, according to UNHCR statistics.","A car bomb targets a church in central Kirkuk .

1293,"(Mashable) -- Sir Howard Stringer, CEO of Sony, accidentally told everyone in the world that his company will be supplying image sensors for Apple's iPhone 5. In an interview late Friday with the Wall Street Journal's Walt Mossberg, the Sony chief was talking about earthquake damage to 15 of the Sony's factories in Japan, and inadvertently mentioned that a camera sensor made in one of those plants is on its way to Apple, and that sensor would be delayed because of the quake and tsunami. Stringer didn't specifically say that Sony is building an 8-megapixel image sensor that will go into the iPhone 5, but since Sony is currently not manufacturing any image sensors for Apple, this confirmed that Sony plans to supply components of the iPhone 5. This points to the distinct possibility that in the iPhone 5, Apple will no longer be using those OmniVision 5-megapixel image sensors currently inside the iPhone 4. This is supported by an analyst's report from February of this year saying that OmniVision might lose out on supplying cameras for the iPhone 5 because OmniVision's 8-megapixel sensor won't be ready for the iPhone 5's rumored mid-summer launch. Because Stringer was talking about the irony of supplying the company's best camera to Apple, we can only surmise that he was talking about an 8-megapixel sensor. Here's what The Wall Street Journal wrote about Stringer's quote when reporting on its own event this morning: . Early on, he raised the irony of Sony supplying camera components for Apple devices. It ""always puzzles me,"" he said. ""Why would I make Apple the best camera?"" It is unclear what devices he was talking about as Sony isn't known to supply key camera components, known as image sensors, to Apple; A Sony spokeswoman declined to comment and an Apple spokesperson couldn't be reached for comment. Stringer's inadvertent slip also lends credence to the rumors of a delayed release of the iPhone 5. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

1294,"New York (CNN) -- Trees toppled and streets flooded Sunday morning as Irene lashed some of the biggest cities in the Northeast with wind gusts and torrential rains. Even as Irene weakened to a tropical storm, authorities in the region warned that its impact was not waning. ""We're not out of the woods yet. Irene remains a large and potentially dangerous storm,"" U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters. Officials said the storm had knocked out power to more than 4 million people and was responsible for at least 15 deaths in six states. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said flooding in his state was widespread and advised residents to stay indoors. Streets in downtown Millburn, New Jersey, saw major flooding when the Rahway River overflowed early Sunday morning, said Lt. Peter Eakley, the town's deputy emergency management coordinator. ""It's crazy. ... The water is moving between buildings, up, down, all sorts of different directions,"" Rich Graessle told CNN's iReport. In New York City's lower Manhattan, the Hudson River overflowed, sending massive amounts of water spilling over jogging paths and pouring into at least one nearby apartment building. Water also lapped over the banks of the city's East River early Sunday, but later receded. CNN affiliate WCBS reported serious flooding in Brooklyn. Irene left streets looking barren and desolate in ""the city that never sleeps."" Shelves upon empty shelves greeted shoppers at stores. Caution tape barricaded the turnstiles at subway stops. But the flooding's greatest impact may be far from view, former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told CNN. ""The challenge of New York is that so much of the electricity and other infrastructure is below the surface,"" he said. That means flooding could bring life in the city to a standstill even after waters recede, he said. The threat of flooding extended beyond New York City. Outside Philadelphia, waters had already climbed to street-sign levels in Darby, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said, sending ""couches, furniture, all kinds of stuff floating down the street."" Waves pounded the shoreline in Long Beach, New York, as water poured underneath the boardwalk and into the city's downtown area. By 11 a.m. ET Sunday, Tropical Storm Irene had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving inland over southeastern New York state and heading northeast toward New England. Even as winds decreased, the hurricane center warned that an ""extremely dangerous storm surge"" was expected in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and parts of Long Island, New York. The storm slammed into Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey, as a Category 1 hurricane around 5:30 a.m., the hurricane center said, hitting cities along the coast as it hurtled toward New York City. While most New Yorkers stayed holed up in their apartments, officials and residents in states further south began taking stock of the damage Irene left behind. Authorities in Ocean City, Maryland, reopened the evacuated city. ""It was a long night last night, but I can tell you, we dodged a missile here at Ocean City,"" Mayor Rick Meehan told reporters. While Irene dumped 12 inches of rain by early Sunday morning, there was no major flooding. The maximum storm surge coincided with low tide, preventing the flooding that had been feared. Timing ""made a significant difference,"" Meehan said. But flooding remained a concern in many areas, said Craig Fugate, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""Assessments are still coming in,"" Fugate said Sunday morning, noting that Virginia reported particularly high rainfalls. Powerful gusts were so strong in some states that pedestrians struggled to stay upright. Storm surges along the East Coast turned at least one beach into an extension of the ocean. Two buildings collapsed in Philadelphia, Nutter told reporters, but no one was injured. A nuclear power reactor in Calvert Cliffs, Maryland, automatically went offline late Saturday after a piece of aluminum siding from a building struck a transformer amid strong winds. ""The facility is safe; there is no impact to employees or our neighbors,"" said Mark Sullivan, spokesman for the Constellation Energy Nuclear Group. ""There is no threat."" Officials have blamed at least 15 deaths across the affected region on Irene -- one each in Connecticut, Maryland and Florida, two in New Jersey, six in North Carolina and four in Virginia. A 55-year-old male surfer died around noon in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, and a woman in Queenstown, Maryland, died after a tree knocked a chimney through the roof of her home, officials said. Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy said downed wires appear to be to blame for one fatality in his state. Irene first made landfall in the United States Saturday in North Carolina near Cape Lookout at the southern end of the Outer Banks. It stomped across the state for most of the day. The storm ripped off roofs, toppled trees, induced ""massive flooding"" near the coast and brought down power lines statewide, according to the state emergency management division. The hurricane unleashed 10 to 14 inches of rain over much of North Carolina and pushed a 4-foot storm surge into the Chesapeake Bay, the National Hurricane Center said. As of midnight Saturday, Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, had endured 31 hours of nonstop rainfall. Reports of tornadoes came from several states, including North Carolina and Virginia -- but a final determination will have to be made by the National Weather Service. CNN's Tom Cohen, Rob Marciano, Ali Velshi, Soledad O'Brien, Rose Arce, Jeanne Meserve, Chris Boyette, David Mattingly, Susan Candiotti, Chris Lawrence, Jason Carroll, John Zarrella, Kimberly Segal, Sarah Hoye, Poppy Harlow, Holly Yan, Kristina Sgueglia, Eden Pontz, Gregory Clary and Elizabeth Cherneff contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities say at least 15 have died in six states due to the storm .

1295,"(CNN) -- The site of a deadly truck-train collision east of Reno, Nevada, remained shut Saturday as federal accident investigators examined the scene, a state trooper said. Two people died in the Friday morning accident, Trooper Dan Lopez of the Nevada Highway Patrol confirmed Saturday morning. The highway patrol could not be reached later Saturday. Amtrak said Friday it had reports that at least one passenger, an Amtrak train crew member and the operator of the truck died. The National Transportation Safety Board would not comment on the death toll Saturday. It was not immediately clear how many people were injured when a tractor-trailer slammed into the Chicago-to-California Amtrak passenger train at a railroad crossing near Lovelock, Nevada. Amtrak said that numerous people aboard the train had been taken to area hospitals for treatment. Amateur video taken after the crash showed huge plumes of black smoke billowing from the train as a fire burned. Passengers and crew members stood outside. One voice on the video can be heard telling people to get away from the smoke. Another tells a woman, out of view, to ""hang and jump."" A third voice asks someone, ""Are you OK?"" ""Next thing I know, we get hit by something. A big ball of fire comes in. I jumped out the window,"" passenger Justin Rhine told CNN affiliate KOLO-TV in Reno. ""I saw people flying on the other side of the train."" The National Transportation Safety Board dispatched investigators within hours of the accident, the agency said. The NTSB has scheduled a press briefing for 9:30 p.m. PT. Saturday. Spokesman Nicholas Worrell declined to comment on the case before then. The truck struck the train, which was on its way to Emeryville, California, at 11:20 a.m., Amtrak said in a statement. The train was carrying 204 passengers and 14 crew members, the company said.","Nevada Highway Patrol confirms two deaths in truck-train collision .

1296,"Kabul, Afghanistan(CNN) -- A suicide bomb attack targeting a hospital in eastern Afghanistan killed at least 35 people and wounded more than two dozen, a brazen strike that rocked a maternity ward and claimed the lives of numerous women and children. The incident occurred Saturday in the Azra district of Logar province when a truck packed with explosives detonated, according to Sifatiullah Haqmal, a member of the provincial council. The head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said ""much of the damage was in the maternity ward of the hospital, and many of those killed and injured were women and children."" The mission noted that assaults on hospitals ""are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law"" and that ""medical workers, clinics and hospitals must be respected and protected in all circumstances."" Dr. Khaliq Yar, head of the provincial projects for a national medical program, described the hospital as a four-ward comprehensive health center, including a section for mothers and children and ten beds for maternity patients. The Logar assault follows a similar strike last month when a suicide bombing tore through a military hospital in Kabul, killing six people and injuring others. ""This is a despicable attack against civilians who were seeking medical care, as well as visiting family members and health workers,"" Staffan de Mistura, the special representative of the secretary-general for Afghanistan, said in a statement on Saturday. ""The terrorists demonstrated a disregard for human life when they targeted Afghans who were patients in a hospital and their visitors and relatives, and hospital personnel,"" the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said in a statement. Casualty reports fluctuated in the hours after the attack. Logar governor's spokesman Den Mohammad Darwish told CNN that along with the 35 deaths, 25 others were wounded. The Logar strike is the second attack in as many days in Afghanistan that targeted civilians, just days after President Barack Obama outlined a plan to withdraw 30,000 troops from the country by September 2012. Along with the Logar strike, a bomb attack in the northern province of Kunduz on Friday killed at least 10 people,  actions the embassy called ""devastating."" The Afghan President Hamid Karzai and NATO's International Security Assistance Force also issued statements condemning both incidents, and said the violence underscores warnings from military commanders that insurgents are intent on pursuing large-scale strikes. ""The insurgents have a complete disregard for the innocent people of Afghanistan who are trying to live in peace,"" ISAF spokesman Rear Adm. Vic Beck said. The Kunduz incident on Friday occurred in the province's Khan Abad district square, said Mohibullah Saidi, a spokesman for the provincial governor. Along with the 10 deaths, 24 people were wounded in the attack, the Ministry of Interior said. The bomb was placed in a bicycle and was detonated by remote control, Saidi said. ISAF also reported the deaths of two service members on Saturday in separate insurgent attacks in eastern Afghanistan, and the alliance confirmed that one of them was a French service member. The nationality of the other soldier was not immediately available. There have been 48 international troop deaths in June and 264 this year, according to a CNN count of casualties. The French government said its soldier was wounded by insurgent fire in a fight during a reconnaissance mission in Kapisa province and died later at a hospital. He is the 63rd French soldier to die in the Afghan war. France announced Thursday that it would also begin to reduce troop numbers, saying it ""will initiate a progressive withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan, and will follow a timetable comparable to the withdrawal of the American troops."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy's office said the withdrawal will be done in consultation with NATO allies and the Afghan government. All French soldiers could be out of Afghanistan by 2013, French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet told France Info radio Thursday.

1297,"New York (CNN) -- The bus company involved in an accident that left 15 people dead in New York this weekend has been involved in at least two other crashes with injuries in the past two years, government records show. World Wide Travel was involved in a crash in New York in 2009 that resulted in one injury, and a crash in New Jersey in 2010 resulting in one injury, according to records on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration website. The company has been cited five times for ""fatigued driving"" between December 2009 and October 2010 -- twice in in New Jersey, twice in Pennsylvania and once in Connecticut, records show. At least 14 passengers died early Saturday after the driver of their tour bus lost control of the vehicle and struck two sign poles, one located directly behind the other, on Interstate 95 in the Bronx, New York police said. World Wide Travel declined to comment to CNN, despite repeated calls, other than to refer to a published statement saying the company was ""heartbroken"" at the deaths and injuries. ""We are a family owned company and realize words cannot begin to express our sorrow to the families of those who lost their lives or were injured in this tragic accident,"" the company statement said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with them. We will continue to use every resource at our disposal to assist and work with investigators to determine what happened."" The crash occurred about 5:30 a.m. on a stretch of I-95 called the New England Thruway near the Bronx-Westchester County line, officials said. The accident forced the closing of I-95 in both directions until late Saturday, police said. Along with those who were killed, eight of the 31 passengers suffered severe injuries and were transported to area hospitals with the remaining survivors. At least five people being treated at New York's St. Barnabas Hospital suffered skull and spinal fractures, internal bleeding and broken bones, Dr. Ernest Patti told reporters. The bus, which had departed from the Mohegan Sun Resort and Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut, was bound for Chinatown in Manhattan, according to news reports. The bus driver, Ophadel E. Williams, 40, of Brooklyn suffered ""non-life-threatening injuries,"" police said. Five of the injured were taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, 14 were transported to Jacobi Medical Center. Passenger Chung Ninh, 59, who suffered only a hand inury, told reporters he was asleep when the accident occured. Ninh said he woke to find himself hanging upside down in his seat belt, surrounded by other passengers either screaming or dead and covered in broken glass. Ninh he said he tried to help an unconscious woman nearby. ""I put my hand on the neck and no movement, no nothing,"" Ninh told reporters. Police said Williams told investigators that the accident occurred after he swerved to avoid a tractor-trailer that might have clipped the bus. The bus then flipped on its side and smashed into the poles, which cut through two thirds of the vehicle. Police recovered a tractor-trailer that was traveling through the area at the time and interviewed the vehicle's driver. The driver of the tractor trailer denied that two vehicles collided before the bus crashed, the law enforcement source told CNN. ""We're treating him as a witness, not a suspect,"" according to the the law enforcement source, who is involved in the investigation. Meanwhile, federal investigators are considering other potential causes of the crash, including mechanical problems, steering and brake issues as well as the possibility the driver fell asleep. Some surviving passengers, according to news reports, told police that they felt the bus roll over rumble strips before the crash. At a Sunday afternoon press conference, National Transportation Safety Board Vice-Chairman Christopher Hart said investigators are looking for video recordings taken at the casino and, possibly, an electronic hotel key card that might track some of Williams' activities within 72 hours of the accident. Police officials have said they are also looking into the possibility that the bus driver had been speeding prior to the accident. Two UPS couriers told CNN affiliate WABC-TV that they twice saw the bus traveling very fast on the highway before the accident. ""I felt my vehicle shake from the turbulence of the wind,"" driver Joe Insalata told WABC . Insalata's co-worker, Ira Berman said they saw the bus a second time. ""When we saw the logo on the back of the bus, we were like, 'World Wide Tours,'"" Berman told WABC. ""'That's the guy that passed us about 15 minutes ago at a very high rate of speed.'"" ""And that was when Joe was like, ""I'm calling the cops,'"" Berman said. Investigators are examining Williams' background and testing his blood for the presence of alcohol. New York State Police Maj. Michael Kopy said Saturday a video camera had been recovered from the bus, but that investigators had not yet viewed it. Hart described the video as coming from a ""forward looking camera"" that had been installed on the bus. Meanwhile, the bus engine control module, also known as the black box, was sent to an NTSB laboratory in Washington, D.C. NTSB investigators visited the crash site for the first time Sunday. According to Hart, skid marks left by the bus show the vehicle hit the guardrail on the right of I-95 ""at least three times"" over the course of 480 feet before crashing into sign posts that sliced through the vehicle. At least seven passengers had to be extracted by removing seats and cutting a hole in the remaining roof. Most of the passengers were thrust to the forward third of the bus as it split open, suffering injuries mainly from the chest up, Fire Chief Edward Kilduff said. ""Our -- and the entire city's -- prayers, thoughts and sympathies are with the victims, and their families and loved ones,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a written statement Saturday. ""Many of the victims are Chinese, and we have brought in translators to help assist the families.""

1298,"Dawu, Taiwan (CNN) -- Typhoon Nanmadol pounded Taiwan with heavy rains Monday before it was downgraded to a tropical storm and headed toward China. The storm made landfall in the southern portion of Taiwan about 3 a.m. Monday, dousing some areas with up to 300 mm (11 inches) of rain, officials said. There were no immediate reports of casualties, although officials closed several highways in the landslide-prone region. Nanmadol reached Taiwan after pummeling the Philippines over the weekend. By Monday, the death toll in the Philippines had climbed to 12. Among them were two children who died when Nanmadol, known locally as Mina, triggered a landslide in northern Philippines on Saturday, authorities said. The landslide buried the victims in Pangasinan province, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Ten others were killed in different incidents, 21 people were injured, and nine remain missing, the council said in a statement Monday.

1299,"(CNN) -- Southwest Airlines announced Saturday that it is grounding 79 planes for inspection after a 3- to 4-foot hole tore open in the fuselage of one of its planes, bringing a view of the blue sky and a white-knuckled emergency descent. The plane -- which had been traveling from Phoenix to Sacramento, California -- managed to make an emergency landing at a military base in Yuma, Arizona, on Friday. There authorities ""discovered a hole in the top of the aircraft,"" the company said earlier. Investigators are trying to determine what caused the ""depressurization event"" and have ""decided to keep a subset of its Boeing 737 fleet out of the flying schedule to begin an aggressive inspection effort in cooperation with Boeing engineers,"" according to a company statement. ""The safety of our customers and employees is our primary concern, and we are grateful there were no serious injuries,"" said Mike Van de Ven, Southwest's executive vice president and chief operating officer. The airline initially reported that 81 of its Boeing 737 aircraft would be grounded, but later decreased the number of planes to be inspected for what it called ""aircraft skin fatigue."" The inspections will take place at five locations over the course of the next several days, the airline said. Southwest expected to cancel about 300 flights Saturday to accommodate the inspections. It advised customers to check the status of their particular flight or rebook their trip before heading to the airport. They may ""experience sporadic delays of up to two hours on some flights."" National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said a preliminary investigation showed the aircraft suffered a ""structural failure"" and ""depressurization"" that prompted the emergency landing. A subsequent review will investigate the aircraft's structure, metallurgical aspects of the plane, flight data recordings and its maintenance records, he said. ""We're in the beginning stages of the investigation,"" Sumwalt added. Meanwhile, some of the 118 passengers who were aboard the crippled Boeing 737 said they had feared for their lives. ""We were in shock,"" passenger Debbie Downey told CNN Saturday. ""We were in row 16 and my husband and I could see blue sky ... the wiring, the cabling. It actually was terrifying."" She said. ""a lot of people were crying and holding hands"" but had trouble hearing due to the noise of air rushing through the plane's opening. ""It was very, very scary."" ""I heard a loud popping sound about three or four minutes before it blew open on us,"" passenger Greg Hansen said. ""(Then) a big explosion happened. A big noise, and from there, you felt some of the air being sucked out. It happened right behind me, in the row behind me and it covers about 2 1/2 rows,"" he said from seat 11C. Hansen, 41, a regional sales manager for a biotech company, was flying home to Sacramento, California, from a business trip. Some people panicked and screamed as the blue sky and sun began to shine through the cabin in midflight, he said. ""Most people were just white knuckles holding onto the arm rests. The pilots did a great job and were under control to get us to a manageable level,"" he said. But just behind him, Hansen said he could see the jagged edge of the aircraft where the rivets used to be. ""You can see the insulation and wiring. The interior ceiling panel was bouncing up and down with the air,"" he said. ""It was surreal, when you're riding in a modern aircraft. You're used to being enclosed and not having the window rolled down,"" he said. Hansen described the hole as being about 3 or 4 feet long and about a foot wide. Passenger Brenda Reese told CNN affiliates KCRA and KOVR she began to fear for her life. ""I was texting my sister to make certain that she told my kids that I loved them,"" Reese said. Southwest Flight 812, which had a five-member crew, then made an emergency landing at Yuma Marine Corps Air Station/International Airport at 5:07 p.m. (7:07 p.m. ET.) The Federal Aviation Administration said the captain made a rapid, controlled descent from 36,000 feet to about 11,000 feet after the cabin lost pressure. ""We do not know the cause of the decompression,"" said Ian Gregor of the FAA. Hansen said the incident took place about 35 minutes into the flight. He said it took about 45 seconds or a minute before the oxygen masks came down after the hole blew open. ""The crew was pretty calm about it. They walked around and checked on everyone,"" he said. ""But it wasn't like the movies where papers get sucked out of the hole, but you could feel it and hear the noise."" Hansen said most of the passengers were complaining of a pain in their eardrums from a rapid descent. Southwest said Saturday at least two minor injuries were reported, but neither the flight attendant nor the passenger were taken to a hospital. Hansen said one male flight attendant appeared to fall and was bleeding from a facial injury. Yuma International Airport spokeswoman Gen Grosse said passengers were tended to and given refreshments because the temperature on the tarmac was close to 100 degrees. Southwest said it provided a full refund, an apology and two complimentary round-trip passes on the airline for future flights. The second flight landed in Sacramento on Friday night. Boeing spokeswoman Julie O'Donnell declined to comment on possible causes of the incident. ""Boeing is committed to ensuring safe flight and to supporting our customers,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are working closely with Southwest and are providing technical assistance to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board as it investigates the incident."" An NTSB investigative team arrived Saturday in Yuma and entered the plane. A total of 288 Boeing 737-300s are currently operating in the U.S. fleet, and 931 operate worldwide, according to the FAA.

1300,"Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina (CNN) -- Hurricane Irene lashed coastal North Carolina late Friday and had metropolitan New York in its sights, staying on an unusual track that could bring deadly storm surge, heavy rainfall and misery to millions. With winds at 100 mph, Irene churned toward an anticipated 7 to 8 a.m. landfall Saturday between Beaufort and Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. The latter had a curfew in effect. But the massive storm -- which is shutting down hundreds of airline flights, Broadway shows and the New York subway system -- won't be content to curve away from the mainland after striking North Carolina. Instead, a weakening Irene will head for the Jersey shore, New York and southern New England, dangerous conditions in tow, forecasters said. ""We're going to see tropical storm-force winds for as much as 24 hours in some places and, in North Carolina, near and to the east of the center, they could experience hurricane force winds for as much as 10 hours,"" Ed Rappaport of the National Hurricane Center told CNN. Irene roiled the surf and blew strong gusts of rain into the Carolinas as it neared landfall. Ernie Seneca, a North Carolina spokesman, said authorities were concerned about the ""entire eastern half of the state. This hurricane could potentially impact an area that includes 20 counties and 3.5 million people."" Irene was about 195 miles south-southwest of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, at 11 p.m. ET Friday, according to the hurricane center. Hurricane warnings were in effect from Little River Inlet, North Carolina, to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. A hurricane warning means sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are expected within 36 hours. President Barack Obama warned that Irene could be a ""hurricane of historic proportions."" The Category 2 storm had top sustained winds of 100 mph, and it is expected to be borderline Category 1, with maximum winds of 95 mph, when it comes ashore Saturday and moves toward the Mid-Atlantic states, according to forecasters. ""This could still be a large and powerful storm,"" North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue said. Evacuations were ongoing in 19 counties. An ocean surge of up to 11 feet is possible in coastal North Carolina, tearing away beaches and probably damaging homes, businesses and other structures before sliding up the East Coast to New England, Hurricane Center Director Bill Read said. Storm surges of 4 feet to 8 feet are possible in the Virginia Tidewater region, with 3- to 6-foot surges farther north along the New Jersey shore, Read said. Other areas were under tropical storm warnings or watches. A tropical storm warning indicates that sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph are expected within 36 hours. A watch means such winds are possible. New York City issued what Mayor Michael Bloomberg said was its first mandatory evacuation order, covering low-lying areas of all five of the city's boroughs. About 250,000 people are affected. Authorities warned of widespread and prolonged power outages, flash flooding and storm surges that could flood low-lying communities and possibly inundate subway systems. The New York Metropolitan Transit Authority will shut down its system at noon Saturday. Five airports in metropolitan New York will close to arriving flights beginning at noon Saturday. New Jersey Transit will shut down at noon, and the transit system in Philadelphia will halt service at 12:30 a.m. Boston said it intends to keep its system operating. The Garden State Parkway in New Jersey closed 98 miles of southbound lanes Friday night. The storm also was forcing cancellations of concerts, sporting events and, in New York, all the weekend's Broadway shows. Authorities on Friday urged residents who needed to leave to do so immediately. ""The sun is shining, but don't be misled,"" Bloomberg said. ""There is a very dangerous storm headed in our direction."" Even guests in Atlantic City's iconic casinos were being asked to go. And the boardwalk in Ocean City, Maryland, will be quiet during one of the busiest times of the year. Some plucky businesses were digging in. A restaurant in Wilmington, North Carolina, posted a message reading, ""We are open until the letters fly off this sign,"" CNN affiliate WRAL reported. Steve Aarthun, a resident of Wilmington, was preparing for his first hurricane. His wife, Sally, has seen three. They bought a generator, stocked up on bottled water and flashlights, and filled the bathtub with water. ""I feel the lull,"" Aarthun said mid-afternoon Friday. ""You just have the sense it is coming."" The couple lives about a mile from the ocean and were hopeful they could avoid the storm surge. Drew Goulde, a Kill Devil Hills resident and a maintenance worker at a hotel, was surfing, taking advantage of a higher-than-usual tide. ""It is fun,"" Goulde said. ""I'm just messing around right now. It's kind of heavy out there, though."" Governments and private agencies launched an immense effort to prepare for the storm. ""All indications point to this being a historic hurricane,"" Obama said from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, shortly before cutting short his vacation to return to Washington. The mayor of Washington declared a state of emergency. The move opens up additional resources to deal with a storm that Vincent Gray said would ""bring heavy rain, flash floods and high winds to the area."" The federal government began moving tons of supplies to military bases and other staging areas. The U.S. Navy was sending 38 ships to sea, 13% percent of the deployable battle force vessels, a U.S. Navy official said. Tens of millions of people could be affected by the storm as it moves up the densely populated East Coast, and officials urged residents to be prepared for the worst. In New York, Bloomberg said, ""The low-lying coastal areas that will be endangered most by storm surge include Coney Island and Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn, Far Rockaway and Broad Channel in Queens, South Beach, Midland Beach, and other low-lying areas on Staten Island, Battery Park City in Manhattan, and some small sections of the Bronx."" He added, ""Now, we have never done a mandatory evacuation before, and we wouldn't be doing this now if we didn't think the storm had the potential to be very serious."" Amtrak, Greyhound and major U.S. airlines canceled routes and flights. American Airlines canceled all flights in the Washington area from noon Saturday to noon Sunday, said spokesman Ed Martelle. AirTran Airways has canceled 308 flights through Monday, according to an airline spokeswoman. JetBlue Airways has canceled almost 900 flights in the Northeast ahead of the storm. Most of those are Sunday and Monday flights out of the New York metro area and Boston, said spokesman Mateo Lleras. Delta Air Lines will cancel 1,300 flights from Saturday to Monday, spokesman Anthony Black said. Southwest Airlines said it is canceling scores of flights to and from the East Coast. US Airways is planning ""significant flight schedule reductions"" at a number of airports, including Reagan Washington National, John F. Kennedy International and Newark International.

1301,"(CNN) -- The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center canceled a tsunami warning less than an hour after it was issued Wednesday for Kermadec Island, Tonga and New Zealand. A tsunami was detected following a major earthquake nearby. A 1-meter-high tsunami washed ashore at Raoul Island, the largest and northernmost of the main Kermadec Islands, said Vinhlu Hsu, a geophysicist with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii. It caused no damage, he said. The tsunami formed after an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.6 shook the Kermadec Islands at 7:03 a.m. Thursday (3:03 p.m. ET Wednesday), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake was centered 163 kilometers (101 miles) east of Raoul Island, and 913 kilometers (567 miles) south of Nuku'alofa, Tonga, the survey said. The depth was a relatively shallow 20 kilometers (12.4 miles). ""Sea-level readings confirm that a tsunami was generated,"" the center said. New Zealand's Ministry of Civil Defense and Emergency Management said it was keeping a marine threat warning in place throughout Thursday for waters off northern New Zealand. Spokesman Vince Cholewa told CNN that boaters should not take to sea or operate in estuaries and people should stay off the beaches and coasts. ""There's no foreseen threat of inundation, but tides and waves could cause serious problems for boaters,"" said Cholewa.  ""We don't want people sightseeing down along the beaches today."" Boaters should take extra care to secure their ships in harbor, and should contact portmasters for the latest conditions, he urged. The West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said no tsunami was expected along the Pacific Coast in the U.S. or Canada. In coastal locations that have experienced strong shaking, underwater landslides can trigger local tsunamis, the center said.

1302,"(CNN) -- Scores of people died Thursday in and around the restive Syrian city of Hama, activists said, corroborating reports of widespread casualties a day after the start of a new military clampdown targeting protesters. At least 109 people died in and around Hama, said Avaaz, a global activist group, citing a medical source. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria said 30 people were killed Wednesday. ""The brutality continues in Hama on the fourth day of Ramadan. Communication with the city and surrounding area is very difficult as the electricity supply has been cut off,""  Avaaz said. The activist group, citing the medical source, said scores more were wounded. ""Bodies are lying in the streets as ambulances and private vehicles are unable to get through,"" the group said. The western Syrian city is the center of the country's anti-government movement, whose efforts have prompted a crackdown by security personnel on the huge demonstrations there in an effort to secure the city. Citing the medical source, Avaaz said bodies taken to al Hourani Hospital had been shot at close range, most of them in the head. The geographic breakdown was 48 dead in the town of Hai al Hadyr, 31 in the town of Janoub al Manaab, and 30 in the northern part of Hama and the Hamidia area, it said. One resident who spoke to CNN by satellite phone said some of the casualties who were taken to hospitals died there because the facilities were without electricity. There were reports of a breakdown and cutoff in communications and electricity accompanying the siege, and of the military bombing the city. The resident said entrances of the city were blocked, with no one getting in or out, and snipers were stationed across the city. People who tried to leave, he said, were being shot. The man said about 10 people had been killed and dozens more were wounded. Hama, which has seen massive demonstrations by anti-government protesters, was the site of the 1982 bloody crackdown by the Alawite-dominated government against a Muslim Brotherhood uprising. Memories of that siege, carried out by late President Hafez al-Assad, the father of President Bashar al-Assad, have reverberated during the nearly five-month uprising, and the ongoing violence in Hama has prompted international anger against the al-Assad regime. Reports of violence also emanated from the capital. Four people who were at al-Rifai Mosque in Kafr Sousa Square in the suburbs of Damascus offered separate but similar accounts. One of the sources is a representative of the Syrian Revolution Coordination Union, an opposition group. Two of the others were among the protesters. After prayers, worshipers exited the rear of the mosque to join an anti-government demonstration, but were met by about 24 thugs -- men in civilian clothes armed with guns and batons, the sources told CNN in telephone interviews. The men fired into the air and beat some of the worshipers as they left the buildings, the sources said. Upon reaching Kafr Sousa Square, where they chanted for freedom and the fall of the regime, they were set upon by gunmen and others who threw rocks at them. At that point, the demonstrators returned to the mosque and closed themselves inside, the sources said. A few militia members entered the front yard of the mosque carrying batons and stun guns and attacked the protesters who were there, the sources said. The protesters were allowed safe passage out of the mosque after they promised to end their protests, the sources said. But the protesters were expected to resume Friday, when rebels said the theme would be ""God is With Us."" CNN is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in Syria, which has restricted access to the country by international journalists, including CNN's. The move came a day after the U.N. Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties. But Amnesty International on Thursday slammed the council's response as ""completely inadequate"" and ""limp"" because it failed to take action. The council issued a presidential statement, which carries no enforcement weight. ""It's crucial that a U.N. Human Rights Council fact-finding mission to Syria is able to investigate the situation as soon as possible,"" said Jose Luis Diaz, Amnesty International's representative to the United Nations. ""Unfortunately, the Security Council has also failed to provide support for such a mission."" He noted that Syrian authorities have not permitted a U.N. fact-finding delegation into the country to investigate the situation. ""The U.N. must act now, with a firm and legally binding position. At the very least, its position must include imposing an arms embargo, freezing the assets of President al-Assad and other officials suspected of responsibility for crimes against humanity, and referring the situation to the ICC prosecutor,"" he said, in reference to the International Criminal Court. Two permanent members of the Security Council weighed in on how to proceed. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Syria's citizens should solve their problems themselves, state-run RIA Novosti said. ""The settlement in this country should be carried out by the Syrians themselves without outside interference and should be based on an all-Syria dialogue, which is the only way to resolve the conflict,"" the ministry said in a statement. But later Thursday, RIA Novosti said that Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told reporters that he had told al-Assad during meetings and in letters that ""it is necessary to hold a referendum, put up with the opposition, restore peace and create a modern state."" Medvedev added that if al-Assad were to fail, he would be destined to ""a sad fate, and ultimately we will also have to make some kind of decisions."" French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Thursday that the Security Council may take a tougher stance on Syria ""if nothing changes on the Syrian side."" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, issued on Thursday an update about Deir Ezzor, a city in the country's northeastern region. It said an opposition leader in the city reported that the government had launched a series of measures to punish residents. They include not paying government employees, halting wheat deliveries to bakeries, preventing hospitals from rescuing wounded protesters, and asking governmental medical staff to leave their posts. Some pharmacists have closed their shops over fears that they will be detained for giving medications to wounded protesters. Meanwhile, al-Assad has issued a decree authorizing a multiple-party political system, state media reported Thursday. Syrian lawmakers had already passed a law granting citizens the right to establish political parties with the aim of contributing to political life ""through peaceful and democratic means,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. However, the Syrian opposition has argued the decrees are intended for show and will not effect real change. That's because it is questionable whether the move, absent constitutional reform, could end decades of single-party Baathist rule. One of the articles of the Syrian constitution guarantees supremacy for the ruling Baath party.

1303,"Tokyo (CNN) -- An environmental group on Monday urged the incoming Japanese prime minister to delay the start of school near a nuclear plant crippled by a massive earthquake and tsunami six months ago. Fukushima city schools are scheduled to reopen Thursday. The March 11 disaster triggered the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl, as cores overheated and spewed radioactive material into surrounding areas. Greenpeace said the government's decontamination plan is lacking, adding that its team found average radiation doses remained high in areas decontaminated by the government. Areas where local communities had conducted further cleanups contained decreased radiation levels, the group said in a statement. ""No parent should have to choose between radiation exposure and education for their child,"" said Kazue Suzuki, Greenpeace Japan nuclear campaigner. A foreign affairs spokesman said it was premature to ask the incoming prime minister to delay school. ""Mr. Yoshihiko Noda was just elected as Democratic Party leader. He has not assumed the post of prime minister yet, therefore he cannot comment on this,"" said Kazuhiro Kawase, the spokesman. Japan's ruling party on Monday picked Noda, the finance minister, as its new leader, bringing him a step closer to becoming the prime minister. Parliament will vote Tuesday on whether he will assume the position of prime minister -- the country's sixth in five years. Japan has launched a sweeping review of nuclear power since the disaster at Fukushima Daiichi, which displaced more than 100,000 residents.","Fukushima city schools are scheduled to reopen Thursday .

1304,"(CNN Student News) -- March 14, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Japan  • Santa Cruz, California . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: We're dedicating this edition of CNN Student News to our audience in Japan. The world is watching in support, and you are not alone. First Up: Japan Earthquake . AZUZ: The nation of Japan is reeling today, trying to recover from a devastating natural disaster. The earthquake hit the island nation on Friday. It registered a magnitude of 8.9. That makes it the most powerful quake to hit Japan in at least 100 years. There were reports over the weekend that the quake moved the main of island of Japan -- the entire island -- by 8 feet! And this is what it left behind: scenes of destruction. On Sunday, officials estimated that more than 1,500 people had been killed; more than 1,900 injured; more than 1,500 more missing. Those estimates all expected to go up. And the worst may not be over. Witnesses have reported feeling aftershocks. And scientists in Japan say that there's a strong chance of another quake, one with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher, hitting in the next few days. Just to get a sense of what this was like, take a listen to this iReport. This was shot by someone outside his house. You can hear the crashes as the area is rattled by the quake. Something just as devastating as the quake was the tsunami -- this giant ocean wave -- that the quake caused. It slammed into the Japanese coast, washing over cities and leaving death and destruction behind it. Tsunami Strikes Japan . AZUZ: The northeastern part of the country took the worst of it. This is what the water looked like rushing into one city. Some areas were completely flattened, with foundations the only sign of the buildings that once stood on them. You might think of a tsunami as this towering tidal wave that crashes down on shore. That's not what this was. Tsunamis are more accurately described as these ""walls of water"" that push onto shore and plow through anything they hit. Scientists believe that when there's friction between two plates below the ocean's surface, like in an earthquake, energy is released. That energy shoots up to the surface, spreads out in a wave. And it travels very fast, as fast as 500 miles per hour! You can see it spreading right here. Now, if you're in a boat out at sea, you might not even feel it. It's incredibly powerful, but not necessarily very high. But look at what happens when that wave gets closer to shore: it slows down and builds up. And that wall of water just bulldozes inland. Look at how this tsunami wave spread. This animation shows you just how far these things can travel. It stretched out in all directions, spanning the Pacific Ocean. It hit Hawaii, causing millions of dollars in damage there. And it even reached the California coast, 5,000 miles from the area near Japan where the quake hit. And when the wave did reach Santa Cruz, California, it was still strong enough to do this: boats tossed like toys in the tub. It's not nearly as destructive as what happened in Japan, but a clear illustration of ocean energy radiated across the world. Japan Earthquake . AZUZ: Trying to put the impact of this earthquake in perspective. Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, called it ""the toughest and most difficult crisis"" for his country since the end of World War II, more than 65 years ago. He said he's confident that the Japanese people can work together to overcome the crisis. That could include making sacrifices, like dealing with electrical blackouts for one thing. The government is planning to run these rolling blackouts in order to save electricity while workers repair power plants. But Prime Minister Kan says right now, Japan has one main goal. NAOTO KAN, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER: Saving people's lives must be our first priority. We must do all that we are able to do to save as many lives as we can now. Just the Facts . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Just the facts! Nuclear power plants generate power through a process called nuclear fission. This is when atoms of uranium, a radioactive element, are split apart. Fission produces a lot of heat energy, and that energy produces steam. The steam turns a turbine, and that's how the plants generate electricity. Meltdown Concerns . AZUZ: Officials in Japan are worried about what's happening at one of the country's nuclear power plants. It has six reactors, six facilities where that fission happens. And three of those reactors were running when the quake hit. The plant has safeguards in place for this kind of a situation. The reactors are supposed to shut down, and emergency generators are supposed to pump water into the reactors to cool them down. Remember, fission generates heat, so if you want it to stop heat quickly, you need to cool it down. But in one of those three reactors, the back-up generators failed. Experts are blaming that on flooding from the tsunami. Another element -- hydrogen -- started building up inside the facility until it caused an explosion that blew the roof off. The reactor was not damaged in the explosion. But that's the big concern here: a problem with the reactor. Like we said, the uranium inside of it is radioactive. And if too much of that radiation gets out, it could contaminate air or water and lead to very serious health problems. World Response . AZUZ: You heard Japan's prime minister say that the number one priority is saving lives. Rescue crews have been working furiously to try to find and help the victims of this earthquake. And the world is coming to Japan's aid as well. The United States, United Kingdom, China, South Korea: just a handful of the nearly 70 countries that have offered to help. Some search-and-rescue teams have already arrived in Japan. More are on the way. International aid groups, like the Red Cross, Save the Children and Doctors Without Borders are getting involved, too. The USS Ronald Reagan -- the warship that you see here -- is also on the scene. Crew members are working with Japanese forces to fly supplies and equipment into the areas that were hit hard by the quake. They're hoping to deliver 30,000 portions of emergency food supplies in the first run. Impact Your World . AZUZ: Sometimes, you hear about a crisis somewhere in the world and wonder ""What can I do?"" We have a way for you. CNN's ""Impact Your World"" program has information on some of the groups that are helping the victims of this quake, and it has ways for you to get involved. You'll find a link to ""Impact Your World"" in the Spotlight section of our home page, CNNStudentNews.com. Goodbye . AZUZ: This is a huge story, and one that we'll certainly be covering more on our show. But there's also a lot of information up on our web site. We have In Depth Coverage on the quake itself and explainers on things like earthquake magnitudes and how nuclear reactors work. Finally today, we have a video that demonstrates the power of this natural disaster and its impact on Japan. We're going to let that close out the show, and we'll see you again tomorrow. (BEGIN VIDEO) RYAN MCDONALD, WITNESS, CNN IREPORTER: My wife and I stood outside and basically held on to the outside of our house. You couldn't even stand up. We have never, ever felt anything on the magnitude, the literal magnitude, of what we experienced today. HARRIS PAYTON, WITNESS, CNN IREPORTER: The whole ground was shaking so much. It was unreal. I can't describe it. MCDONALD: Oh, my god. That is the biggest earthquake to date. Oh, my god, the building's going to fall! AUGUST AMBRISTER, WITNESS, CNN IREPORTER: It just blew up. Woo! Woo! Do you all see this? BRENT KOOI, WITNESS, CNN IREPORTER: The crack is just moving. There's water. I don't know if water lines are broken, but this water was not there a minute ago.

1305,"(CNN Student News) -- May 16, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Louisiana  • Atlanta, Georgia . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Carl Azuz, and today on CNN Student News, we're gonna be talking about something that won't happen until November 6th... of 2012! But we start things off down in Louisiana. First Up: Severe Flooding . AZUZ: Officials facing the threat of massive flooding there have opened several gates on the Morganza Spillway. A spillway is something that goes over or around a dam. It's a safety feature. When too much water builds up around the dam, the spillway's gates can be opened to let some of that water through. This is what the Morganza Spillway looks like normally: gates closed, nothing coming through. But with floodwaters from the Mississippi River rushing in, engineers opened up some of the spillway's gates for the first time in nearly 40 years. That's what you see here: water barreling through the gate. The Morganza Spillway has 125 total gates. Officials plan to open up to one-fourth of those. Opening the gates should divert floodwaters away from major cities, like Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana. But it will send water toward homes and farmland in other parts of the state. People who live there -- many of whom have had to evacuate their homes -- are preparing for devastation. KELLI TRIMM, BUTTE LAROSE, LOUISIANA RESIDENT: It's worse than we thought. It's really worse than we thought. We thought maybe we might have water in our yard. Instead, this is going to come into our home. It's going to take everything we have got. Presidential Politics . AZUZ: The next U.S. presidential election is more than 500 days away. Might sound like the distant future, but there's a lot that happens between now and then. And since that process is already underway, we're going to break some of it down for you today. Ultimately, one candidate from each party will face off in the general election. That's on November 6th, 2012. Before that, candidates have to win their party's nomination. That's what the primary elections help decide. There are lots of political parties out there. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party. We're going to look at the two biggest parties: the Democrats and Republicans. On the Democratic side, President Obama is an incumbent candidate. He's running for re-election to the office he already holds. He announced his campaign last month. The Republican side has a field of candidates. Some of them, like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, U.S. Representative Ron Paul, and former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, have announced their plans to run for president. Others have formed what are called exploratory committees. They haven't officially announced their candidacy, but they're looking pretty seriously at the possibilities. Lot of steps to go through between now and election day. We'll take you through it as campaign season rolls along. Shoutout . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's first Shoutout goes out to Mr. Essex's geography students at Washington Middle School in Miles City, Montana! Whose slogan is ""the toughest job you'll ever love""? Here we go! Is it the: A) Boy Scouts, B) Air Force, C) Peace Corps or D) Supreme Court? You've got three seconds -- GO! A promotional campaign described the Peace Corps as ""the toughest job you'll ever love."" That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Peace Corps at 50 . AZUZ: The organization promotes peace and friendship by having Americans live and work in developing countries. A simple idea, but one that's lasted. The Peace Corps celebrated its 50th anniversary this year. Brooke Baldwin caught up with a new member of the corps as she began her journey. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN F. KENNEDY, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I have today signed an executive order providing for the establishment of a Peace Corps. BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: That was March 1961. In the 50 years since President John F. Kennedy launched the Peace Corps initiative, more than 200,000 volunteers have served in some 139 countries. Twenty-two-year-old Katie Pollak is now one of them. KATIE POLLAK, PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEER: It's an exciting thing to be a part of. So many amazing people have been Peace Corps volunteers, and just the network of people who have done it. They use the word ""family"" a lot. It's exciting to sort of be going into that. BALDWIN: Katie recently earned her college degree in human biology and African studies. She plans to put it to good use for the next 27 months in Senegal, where she'll work in the Peace Corps malaria program. POLLAK: Professionally, this is going to be sort of the best thing that I can do, in terms of on-the-ground experience and whether I want to work broadly in life or doing policy work. And personally, I think it's going to be the biggest challenge of my life, being in an entirely new culture. BALDWIN: Peace Corps volunteers serve in several areas: education, HIV/AIDS awareness, agriculture, and business development, just to name a few. They are provided with health insurance, a housing allowance, and they receive about $7,500 at the end of their 27-month assignment. And the desire to serve is still very strong. KRISTINA EDMUNSON, DEP. COMMUNICATIONS DIR., PEACE CORPS: Today, we have more Peace Corps volunteers in the field than at any time in the last 40 years. And, you know, I think it's representative that Americans are ready to serve. They're standing up. They're answering President Obama's call to service. BALDWIN: Forty-seven people in this latest group of Peace Corps volunteers are heeding that call. COSTA KOKKINOS, PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEER: I just hope to do stuff, to complete projects that people will appreciate. Maybe something that's sustainable, so when I leave they will have it. SARAH KUECH, PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS: Two years seems a lot like now, but in the grand scheme of things, it's really not that big. So, if I can donate a little of my time to try to do some good, I think it's worth a shot. BALDWIN: And for Katie Pollak, she says she is ready for the learning experience of a lifetime. POLLAK: One of the goals of the Peace Corps is to bring a better understanding of Americans to other people around the world. And I hope I can, like, be an ambassador for America. And show sort of the good side. BALDWIN: Brooke Baldwin, CNN. (END VIDEO) Shoutout Extra Credit . BARBARA HALL, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for a Shoutout Extra Credit! When did Jackie Robinson become the first African-American to play in baseball's major league? You know what to do! Was it the: A) 1930s, B) 1940s, C) 1950s or D) 1960s? Another three seconds on the clock -- GO! Jackie Robinson made his major league debut in 1947. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout Extra Credit! Celebrating Civil Rights . AZUZ: Starting with Jackie Robinson, black and white major leaguers played together on the field. But for many years, they couldn't go to the same restaurants and hotels off the field. That changed with the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. Saturday, young people got to play and talk with former all-stars as Major League Baseball honored those who fought for social justice in the game and in the country. The celebration continued yesterday when the Atlanta Braves hosted the Civil Rights Game. The teams wore uniforms from 1974. That's the year that Hank Aaron hit home run number 715 to break Babe Ruth's career record. T.J. Holmes talked to ""Hammerin' Hank"" about the influence of the civil rights era. (BEGIN VIDEO) T.J. HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Some of them were out there before you. But when you kind of got into the mix, is that something you wanted? Did you ever consider yourself kind of a leader being out front, a leader in the civil rights era? Or did you just want to play baseball? HANK AARON, BASEBALL HALL OF FAMER: I wanted to play baseball and I never felt like I was a leader. But I felt like Jackie Robinson had paved the way for, and I wanted to be a baseball player. Let me put it that way. And Jackie Robinson had paved the way for all of us. When I say all of them, myself, Willie and some of the other black who's came before him and was a little bit younger than he was, had paved the way. And I felt like it was my responsibility, not only as a baseball player, but to carry myself in such a way that other blacks would be able to look at me and say, ""oh, I not only want to be the same kind of ballplayer that Hank Aaron was, but I want to carry myself off the field the way that he did."" HOLMES: Do you ever look back and think, ""You know what? I could have done without it, without the record""? AARON: No, I never did. No. I felt like it was my responsibility. God had given me the ability to play baseball. I had the world on my shoulders. I knew that I could do most anything I wanted to do out on the baseball field. And I always felt like I was, it may sound kind of silly, but I always felt like I was surrounded by angels on the baseball field. You know, I just felt like there was absolutely nothing that could happen to me. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, we've got the scoop on a big story out of Canada. It's the world's largest ice cream cake! The massive dessert tipped the scales at more than 22,000 pounds. That's more than 10 tons of ice cream! Engineering students figured out how to build the thing without it melting. Talk about a brain freeze. Thousands of people showed up for the cake's debut. Thousands of lucky people; they each got to try some. Goodbye . AZUZ: Must have been sweet to witness a slice of history. We're gonna chill out for a little bit, but we'll be back tomorrow with more CNN Student News. See you then.","Learn about spillways and the impact that one is having in Louisiana .

1306,"(CNN) -- A Nigerian militant group has claimed responsibility after a car loaded with explosives rammed into the United Nations' building in the capital, killing 23, a government spokesman said Monday. The suicide attack Friday shattered windows, set the building ablaze and left gaping holes on the walls. Radical Muslim sect Boko Haram, which aims to enforce a strict version of Sharia law, has claimed responsibility, said Reuben Abati, the government spokesman. Eighty-one people were injured, he said. The attack targeted a building that housed 26 U.N. humanitarian and development agencies, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week. The Liberian and U.S. embassies are also nearby. ""This was an assault on those who devote their lives to helping others,"" Ban said. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan described the suicide bombing as ""barbaric, senseless and cowardly"" and intensified security around the capital. The capital of Abuja has experienced a series of bombings in recent months. In June, a car blast killed at least five people at the police headquarters in the city. A month later, at least three people died in an explosion near a church outside the capital. The number of casualties could have been higher if services had still been going on, according to a police spokesman. The attacks on the church and police station may have been the work of Boko Haram, the nation's officials said this year. Africa's most populous nation is divided between a largely Christian south and a Muslim north. ""Boko Haram"" translates loosely as ""Western education is forbidden/sinful."" The group holds all government authority in contempt and wants to establish a Sharia state in northern Nigeria. Boko Haram has been running religious schools for years, but did not rise to national prominence until it attacked police stations and prisons two years ago. In retaliation, security forces launched a fierce crackdown that destroyed the group's camp and led to the arrest of its leader, Mohammed Yusuf. He died in police custody.","Boko Haram claims responsibility for the blast .

1307,"Minot, North Dakota (CNN) -- With record water levels poised to inundate the North Dakota town of Minot, the mayor and the state's governor congratulated citizens on an organized and efficient evacuation . ""It's been a very orderly process,"" Mayor Curt Zimbelman said Wednesday of the evacuation process. Gov. Jack Dalrymple said it had ""gone extremely well."" Earlier Wednesday, sirens sounded in Minot, urging residents to abandon their homes in the face of major flooding.  Water is already overtopping the city's dikes, which are leaking in some places. There are roughly 12,000 people in the evacuation zone in and around Minot. Zimbelman and Dalrymple warned that more water than expected is headed toward the town, and it will likely arrive sooner than expected. The Souris River is expected to crest on Monday, two to three days earlier than had been forecast. Zimbelman said the river is expected to rise to a level five feet higher than any previously recorded. Residents were given until Wednesday evening to evacuate because of what state emergency services spokeswoman Cecily Fong called ""historic proportions of water."" There are also concerns the Souris River may be rising more rapidly than expected, Fong said. The National Weather Service predicted record flooding as heavy rains and dam releases cause the river to swell at Minot. Minot got some support from a hometown hero who was halfway around the world. Actor Josh Duhamel, in Moscow for the ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" premiere, asked for donations to the local Red Cross. ""My heart goes out to all the incredible people of Minot & surrounding areas,"" Duhamel said on his Twitter account. The Souris River, which locals call ""The Mouse"" after the French translation of its name, flows through the center of town, and there are several homes and businesses along its low-lying banks. Fearing the main levees would not hold back the water, emergency workers have been constructing local levees around a school and the Broadway Street Bridge, a main thoroughfare. Residents appear to be heeding evacuation warnings. In a sign they're taking the flooding seriously, some residents were pulling up carpets because they are easier to remove now than after their homes have been inundated with water. Not everyone, however, was planning to evacuate. Troy Erickson, 44, lives across the street from the perimeter of the evacuation zone and said he plans to ride out the flood. His neighbor has a bucket loader and they have distributed several loads of sand and gravel around four houses, which are home to 13 people, he said. They have ""lowered a couple hundred sandbags"" on top of the mixture, he said. ""We've got more sandbags coming to have just in case we need to build it higher,"" said Erickson, a lifelong North Dakotan. ""It if happens, it happens."" He said he is ""a little bit"" frightened because he's never been in this situation, though he was a toddler during the flood of 1969. Minot, in the north central part of the state, is the fourth-largest city in North Dakota. The evacuation order covers a third of its population, Fong said. Residents have until 6 p.m. Wednesday to leave. The river at Minot, which currently stands at close to 1,555 feet above sea level, is forecast to rise to 1,559 feet on Friday or Saturday -- which would be a record. The river hit 1,558 feet above sea level in 1881. The Souris River looks like a ""U."" It swoops in and out of North Dakota from Canada.

1308,"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- The final autopsy report on a San Diego State exchange student whose body was pulled from a Madrid river last March indicates an accidental drowning death with no signs of external violence, a Spanish court official said on Tuesday. The student, Austin Taylor Bice, 22, was studying a semester of business courses at the University of Carlos III in Madrid when he went missing after a night out with friends. He was last seen outside a nightclub on the banks of Madrid's Manzanares River. Ten days later, on March 8, police pulled his body from the river. ""There was nothing found in the body that would indicate external factors in the death. There were no wounds on the body,"" said the official from Madrid's Superior Justice Tribunal. He spoke on the customary condition of anonymity. He said the autopsy also showed a ""high level"" of alcohol in the blood. A Madrid judge has kept the case, which is confidential by law, open for further investigation. There was no immediate word on when it might be closed definitively, the official said. After his disappearance, Bice's friends quickly organized a campaign to put up posters of him around Madrid, which read ""Missing. Austin Taylor Bice. U.S. citizen, 22, 1.95 meters tall and 100 kilograms"" (6 feet, 5 inches and 220 pounds), and Spanish and U.S. media reported on the search. Bice's father Larry, an accountant, rushed to Madrid from San Diego to search for his son and met several times with Spanish and U.S. authorities. The family hired private investigators, at first to try to find the student, and later, after his body was recovered, to try to determine what happened, the elder Bice told CNN. At the time of the search, a family member told CNN in Madrid that contrary to initial reports, Bice was not refused entry to the nightclub by doormen and was not drunk, although ""he had a few beers."" Instead, he just decided to go home. On March 8, when police recovered the body, an initial visual inspection did not indicate any signs of violence, Madrid officials said at the time. The U.S.-based Institute of International Education said that in 2007, Spain was the third most popular destination worldwide for Americans studying abroad, after the United Kingdom and Italy. It said there were about 17,000 American students in Spain. The University of Carlos III, where Bice was studying, has 18,000 students, of whom 1,500 are from abroad, including about 220 Americans, Carlos Lopez Terradas, the school's head of international relations, told CNN in early March.","Student went missing after a night out with friends .

1310,"(CNN) -- Major questions hang over the investigation into a deadly accident involving an Amtrak passenger train and a tractor-trailer truck, and it could take up to a year for investigators to come up with answers, a federal official said Sunday. At least 20 people listed on the manifest for the California Zephyr have not been accounted for by authorities, National Transportation Safety Board member Earl Weener told reporters at a news conference. Officials have been trying to resolve the discrepancy since Friday, when a tractor-trailer truck slammed into the Chicago-to-California Amtrak train at a railroad crossing east of Reno, Nevada, killing six people. Weener told reporters at an earlier news conference that investigators believed the discrepancy in passenger numbers arose because some people had either already gotten off the train or bought a ticket but did not take the train. There are also troubling discoveries about the trucking company involved in the crash, John Davies Trucking of Battle Mountain, Nevada. Records indicate that the company had 19 previous safety violations, Weener said. But he warned that further inquiry was in order, since officials didn't have the ""context"" to put the violations in perspective. The NTSB is planning to visit the company this week. Investigators will review records for the company and the driver, Weener said. They will examine the driver's health and medical history as well as his training and experience, he said. The investigation could take up to a year to complete, Weener said, adding that this is the ""fact-finding"" portion of the inquiry. The trucking company, which advertises itself as a family-owned business that hauls concrete, did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. ""An investigation of this sort has many different facets,"" Weener said. ""As we've gotten into the investigation we've realized there are other skills and specialties that we need, such as fire inspectors ... there are just a lot of loose ends that you have to tie up as fast as you can."" Weener said portions of the truck are still embedded in a rail car, making it difficult for investigators to do an assessment. Authorities do not believe the accident was caused by a problem with the safety measures at the intersection where the accident occurred. It has cantilevers, lights, crossing gates, signs and crossbar markings on the pavement, Weener said. Additionally, the light that warns of an approaching train is set to flash for a period that's longer than the federal standard. The 10-car train was carrying 204 passengers and 14 crew members when the accident happened, according to an Amtrak statement released Friday. Skid marks show the driver of the truck involved in the crash slammed on his brakes and slid more than 300 feet before hitting the train, Weener said at an earlier news conference. The slide sparked a fire that burned the truck and two train cars, he said.

1311,"(CNN) -- The U.S. Army's 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment -- The Old Guard -- has posted watch at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery every second of every day for more than 63 years. And they weren't about to let a hurricane get in the way of their tradition. Members of the regiment earned new admiration this week for their unwavering dedication during Hurricane Irene. As the storm whipped the capital with driving sheets of rain, soldiers kept their vigil at the tomb, one hour at a time. Word of their service during the storm has prompted hundreds of comments on the regiment's Facebook page since Saturday, including plenty of ""hooahs"" -- the Army battle cry. ""So proud of you guys!"" said Kristina Wilson. ""Thank you for the honor you are showing to these brave men who are known but to God. You might meet them one day and they can say themselves how proud of you they are."" ""Very few things get me choked up, but seeing this put tears in my eye,"" said Greg Ledet of the photos showing the sentinels at the height of the storm. ""Thank you seems not enough, your stewardship of our collective history is wonderful,"" David Magart said. ""Honor, integrity, respect, these are the values your demonstrate and live by."" The foul-weather display even prompted some cross-service pride from George Gipson. ""You certainly have the respect and admiration of *this* Marine.

1312,"Minami Sanriku, Japan (CNN)  -- A 60-year-old Japanese man was rescued Sunday more than nine miles out at sea after clinging to the swept-away remnants of his home for more than two days. ""I thought today was the last day of my life,"" Hiromitsu Shinkawa told his rescuers, according to Kyodo News Agency. Amazing stories of survival began to emerge in Japan, even amid the horrific destruction of the massive quake and subsequent tsunami that has killed nearly 1,600, destroyed tens of thousands of homes and stoked fears of a potential nuclear power plant meltdown. Three elderly people were found alive in a smashed car that had been tossed by the tsunami. Another woman clung to branches in a tree and took her chances by grabbing onto a floor mat that drifted nearby. The rushing currents pushed her around and around, past many buildings, she said. Her daughter was washed away and remains missing. ""I had been waiting for help all night,"" the rescued mother said. Prime Minister Naoto Kan said about 15,000 people have been rescued so far. Japanese troops were canvassing the destruction by the thousands in search of any sign of life. Hiromitsu Shinkawa, the man rescued at sea, told rescuers he and his wife had returned home shortly after the 8.9-magnitude quake to pick up some belongings when the tsunami slammed the city of Minamisoma. ""I was saved by holding onto the roof, but my wife was swept away,"" he said, according to Kyodo. Video showed him barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood, shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles (15 kilometers) at sea. He could be seen waving a self-made red flag. Rescuers aboard a Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer spotted him and quickly dispatched a smaller rescue boat to pick him up. When a member of the force handed Hiromitsu something to drink on the rescue boat, he drank it and burst into tears, Kyodo reported. ""No helicopters or boats that came nearby noticed me,"" he said. In Minami Sanriku, a town in northeastern Japan, a family photo album lay on the sodden ground, showing a beaming man holding a newborn baby -- happiness out of place amid the devastation. It's been estimated that some 9,500 people -- half the town's population -- may be unaccounted for. Only a handful of buildings were left standing, with the rest a mangled mess of rubble. A boat sat on the edge of town, carried more than two miles inland by the tsunami. When the tsunami warning sounded Friday, ""most people ran away,"" said Choushin Takahaski, who was working in a local government office near the water. ""Some had to leave the elderly or disabled behind on the second floor. I think a lot of those left behind probably died."" As the wave hit, he said, it felt like a dream. ""I saw the bottom of the sea when the tidal wave withdrew and houses and people were being washed out,"" another resident said. ""I couldn't watch anymore."" Forty-two people were found alive Sunday in Minami Sanriku. Search-and-rescue efforts were frequently disturbed by tsunami alerts prompted by ongoing aftershocks. When the alarm sounded, police abandoned their cars, rescue workers blew whistles and people rushed to high ground. ""It's your life!"" shouted one man. ""Run!"" It was a false alarm, but such warnings are taken seriously in the wake of the disaster. In Sendai, south of Minami Sanriku, Hiroki Otomo said his mother and uncle remain missing. They were at the family's home when the tsunami struck. ""Frightening beyond belief,"" Otomo said. ""I have no words."" Many areas of the town are simply gone -- mud and boards littering an area where a row of homes used to stand. A vehicle was found upside-down among tree branches. A school, which had 450 people inside when the tsunami hit, stood with its doors blown open and a jumble of furniture -- plus a truck -- in its hallways. Some teachers and students were able to escape the building, but officials said others did not. Sendai residents said the water reached the treetops as it swept into the town. Cars were tossed like toys, windows blasted out and homes crushed or swept away completely. ""As I was trying to evacuate, the tsunami was already in front of me,"" another young man said. ""I tried to drive, but I ended up running instead.""

1313,"(CNN) -- Numerous U.S. rescue and assistance teams arrived Sunday in Japan and are helping lead a broad international effort to bring relief to areas ravaged by Friday's earthquake and tsunami. The United States, the United Kingdom, China, and South Korea are among 69 governments that have offered to help, Kyodo News Agency reported, citing the Japanese foreign ministry. Aid groups such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have sent teams to some of the worst-hit areas, including Sendai, Narita, Asahi and Tokyo. Mercy Corps International teamed with Peace Winds Japan to rush aid to affected regions. Stephen McDonald of Save the Children told CNN Sunday his group had multiple teams in the country, reaching out to families left homeless. There are water shortages at evacuation centers, creating hygiene challenges, he said. Children are distressed and shaken by the many aftershocks, and unable to rest at the cramped evacuation sites. ""In many cases, they've lost their homes. Some have lost family members,"" he said. Doctors Without Borders said it sent a 10-member team to the area and is assisting ""in the massive government-led relief effort."" The group will split in two on Monday and expand its reach. ""On Sunday, we conducted mobile clinics and assessments in two evacuation centers,"" said Mikiko Dotsu, coordinator of the team, in a statement Sunday. ""It appears that medical needs are increasing in evacuation centers."" The group said it is ""closely monitoring the situation around the Fukushima nuclear power plants."" But it warned, ""In the event of a serious nuclear incident, it is only the Japanese government that will be in a position to react."" The U.S. response effort includes supplies, several warships, search-and-rescue teams, radiation-contamination specialists and two officials from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission with expertise in nuclear reactors. On Sunday, the USS Ronald Reagan started delivering aid in the coastal regions of Japan's Miyagi prefecture. Crew members, in conjunction with the Japan Maritime Self Defense Forces, conducted 20 sorties delivering aid pallets using eight U.S. and Japanese helicopters, according to Sgt. Maj. Stephen Valley of U.S. Forces Japan. The team hopes to deliver 30,000 portions of emergency food rations in this initial operation, Kyodo reported. U.S. Ambassador to Japan John Roos said Sunday that numerous helicopters were ready to take part in missions to reach different parts of the country. A U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Disaster Assistance and Response Team was in Japan and working to coordinate the overall response effort with the U.S. Embassy, Roos said on Twitter. Urban search-and-rescue teams, including about 150 personnel and 12 canines trained to detect live victims, arrived in Japan as well on Sunday, Roos said. The teams are from Los Angeles and Fairfax County, Virginia. ""There are a lot hazards that have never been experienced by a search-and-rescue team,"" Los Angeles Fire Department Inspector Don Kunitomi said, including ""the radiation factor."" He added, ""We're all a little anxious about this."" ""It looks like it'll be part Katrina because of the flooding and part New Zealand because of the earthquake,"" Kunitomi said, referring to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and last year's earthquake in New Zealand. He also noted lessons the search-and-rescue team had learned in Haiti. The Chinese government sent a 15-member team to assist in the search for disaster survivors on Sunday, the Xinhua news agency reported. The team brought with them four tons of equipment and material for the search as well to provide power and telecommunications to areas that have temporarily lost those services because of the quake. A British search-and-rescue team comprising 63 fire service search-and-rescue specialists, two dogs and a medical support team are in Japan, the UK foreign office said Sunday. Specialist consular teams are in the country as well. The teams were taking up to 11 metric tons of rescue equipment, including heavy lifting and cutting equipment to extract people trapped in debris, the government said. South Korea said it was sending two rescue dogs, two handlers and three assistants to carry out what are expected to be dramatic searches of people inside collapsed structures. ""U.S. experts have been in close consultation with Japanese experts regarding the evolving situation at the Fukushima nuclear power plant,"" Roos added. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Incident and Emergency Centre has offered technical assistance to Japan in the wake of an explosion at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The government has evacuated more than 200,000 residents from homes close to the plant and tested 160 people for radiation exposure, authorities said Sunday.

1314,"(CNN) -- As the Passaic River in New Jersey threatened to crest to dangerously high levels Tuesday, residents continued to battle the floodwaters that have forced thousands of people to relocate, authorities said. Search and rescue teams are combing through Passaic County, evacuating residents who are still stuck inside their flood-ravaged homes in the wake of Hurricane Irene, said Edward O'Connell, a spokesman for the county's Office of Emergency Management. About 1,700 residents have been evacuated from their homes in Wayne, Towa, Little Falls, Paterson and Woodland Park communities, said O'Connell. Many more left their homes on their own over the weekend, he added. Rescuers are pulling families and pets alike from their homes and using rafts to transport them down the county's flooded roads. Evacuees are being transferred to several area shelters or taken to the homes of family members living on higher ground. ""It's been pretty much 24 hours a day,"" said Sgt. Alex Popov of the Paterson, New Jersey, Police Department. Popov estimated that about 500 people had been rescued from their homes in Paterson. ""We're dealing with elderly people, families, small children and pets,"" he explained. Forecasters have predicted that the Passaic River, which runs through the southern tip of the county, will swell to a level that is double what is considered to be a ""flood stage"" in some areas. ""They are expecting it to crest sometime today and the other rivers will be rising a little bit as well,"" O'Connell said. ""Hopefully it will crest soon and we can assess the damages,"" he added. CNN's Katie Silver and Rachel Garrett contributed to this report .","The Passaic River is expected to crest at double the flood level, officials say .

1315,"(CNN) -- Two blasts -- the second coming after police and passersby had gathered at the site of the first -- killed seven people and wounded 18 Tuesday evening in the Russian republic of Chechnya, according to the Russian news agency RIA Novosti. The state-run agency said the first blast occurred when officers attempted to detain a suspected militant in the Chechen capital of Grozny. About 30 minutes after that explosion, a second blast hit the same area after people had gathered there, RIA Novosti said. The news agency quoted Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov as saying five police officers, an emergencies ministry official and a civilian died in the two blasts. Rebels in Chechnya started out fighting for independence in the 1990s, but in recent years the fight has been aimed more at imposing Islamist rule and asserting their authority in the area. The standard of living in the southwestern republic is poor compared with the rest of Russia. Unemployment is rampant and infant mortality is high. In addition, the Chechen population of about 1 million is mostly made up of Sunni Muslims, who maintain a distinctly separate cultural and linguistic identity from Russian Orthodox Christians.","NEW: A second blast hits where an earlier one had killed two police officers .

1316,"(CNN) -- One of two wildfires burning in Oklahoma City on Wednesday pushed north toward suburban Edmond, illuminating the windy night sky with spirals of flame and flying embers. The fire broke out Tuesday in the less densely populated northeast Oklahoma City and was moving in a northerly direction toward more largely residential, Edmond Fire Chief Tim Wheeler said. ""The winds have shifted a bit,"" Wheeler said. ""It's current path it's going to travel through a heavily wooded area, which will allow the fire to grow in intensity."" He said it is hoped the fire can be stopped before it crosses Interstate 44 to the southeast of Edmond, but the department had already initiated its Code Red system, which autodials residents' telephone numbers encouraging them to evacuate. About 380 residents were affected by the initial evacuation call, he said. ""It's real difficult to fight a fire like this when it gets to all those trees,"" Wheeler said. ""We can't get our rigs in."" He said that firefighters were getting support during the day from Oklahoma National Guard helicopters equipped with water buckets, ""but now that it's dark, it's up to the crews on the ground."" The northeast fire had claimed about 15 square miles since it broke out on Tuesday. Live aerial images from CNN Oklahoma City affiliate KOCO Wednesday night showed brilliant columns of flame bursting through tree canopies and threatening homes in a residential area. Oklahoma City Fire Chief Keith Bryant said firefighters had ""pretty much"" contained the northeast fire on Wednesday before winds freshened and caused it to flare up anew. Meanwhile, a fire that started Wednesday afternoon in the southeast side of the city had destroyed two structures and caused some evacuations, he said. Bryant said that fire covered an area 1.5 miles long and a mile wide. KOCO reported that the evacuations from the southeast section covered a square-mile area. The fires forced closure of a 40-mile section of Interstate 44 between the capital city and Tulsa, according to Jack Damrill, a spokesperson with the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority. Bryant said that in the case of both fires, the evacuations have been targeted because the areas are not densely populated. He said the department's resources have been stretched thin trying to fight the fires amid the high winds and tinder-dry conditions. Like neighboring Texas, nearly all of Oklahoma is suffering from a severe drought, with two-thirds under the most severe category, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.","NEW: Fire moves north, threatening northern suburban city of Edmond .

1317,"Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- A series of explosions that killed 15 people when they erupted Thursday morning in a cafe in the city of Marrakech was an act of terrorism, Morocco's interior minister said. ""We will investigate this act of terrorism and find those responsible ... and their nationality,"" Taib Cherqaoui told reporters about the attack, in which at least 22 others were wounded. ""We condemn it as a criminal act."" In an address on state-run television, Cherqaoui and King Mohamed VI said the fatalities included six French nationals, five Moroccans, and four others whose nationalities were not divulged. CNN has learned that, of the four remaining fatalities, two were Russian and one was British. The incident occurred around 11 a.m. at Cafe Argana in Marrakech's old city, which is designated by the United Nation's cultural arm as a World Heritage Site. Tourists flock to it in high numbers this time of the year and it is usually packed with stalls, story-tellers and snake-charmers. World leaders moved quickly to condemn the incident. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was ""appalled,"" according to a statement from his office. ""He reiterates his firm rejection of the use of indiscriminate violence against innocent civilians and maintains that no political objective justifies or is served by such heinous acts."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States ""condemns in the strongest terms today's terrorist attack,"" adding, ""Acts of terrorism must not be tolerated wherever and whenever they occur."" French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe condemned what he called a ""barbarian terrorist attack, which nothing can justify."" ""Such an awful act can only bring indignation and unreserved condemnation. All light must be shed on this revolting crime, officials prosecuted, tried and punished,"" said Juppe, who said French authorities will provide assistance to French nationals in Marrakech. ""We were walking around the souks, right around the corner from Cafe Argana,"" said a German tourist who was about 50 meters from the blast when it occurred. ""We heard a gigantic boom, and everyone immediately starting running towards the square to see what happened."" The woman, who didn't want her name used, told CNN the top floor and terrace of the cafe were ""ripped apart"" by the blast, which caused hundreds of people to run from the area. It was not immediately known whether the attack was linked to unrest across the Arab world or militant activity, although there have been protests in Morocco lately. The blast comes four days after thousands of Moroccans held a peaceful demonstration nationwide, calling Sunday for a radical overhaul of the country's governance before a new constitution is unveiled in June by King Mohammed VI. The march was organized by the Facebook youth movement Fevrier 20. The group said its members would not accept the draft constitution because it was written by the king's own people. It denounced his decision to refer the new constitution to a committee he appointed. King Mohammed announced last month he would give up some of his wide-scale powers and make the judiciary independent -- the latter a particularly hot subject in Morocco. Calls for an end to political detention and questions about the king's personal business activities were also on protesters' banners. There was visible resentment at the royal family's business operations, controlled by its holding company SNI. There were also groups protesting about the prices of basic household items. Since the Casablanca attacks of 2003, in which 33 bystanders and 12 suicide bombers were killed, the Moroccan government has impressed international officials for breaking up Islamic terrorist cells. For example, the Madrid train bombings in 2004, in which 191 people died, were assisted by a Moroccan group of terrorists -- 19 of whom are serving sentences in Moroccan prisons.

1318,"(CNN) -- The debate over funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency continued Wednesday as federal officials traveled to New Jersey and New York to check on local recovery and response efforts after Hurricane Irene. The agency's disaster relief fund has less than $800 million remaining and could run out before the end of the current fiscal year on September 30. With conservative House Republicans, led by Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, calling for spending cuts to offset any increase in emergency funds -- a measure opposed by many Democrats -- the ability of Congress to act quickly on the issue remains uncertain. ""Right now, we're continuing our obligations to respond"" with rescue operations and meeting the immediate needs of storm survivors, FEMA administrator Craig Fugate said Wednesday. The only thing the agency has done, he said, is state that it won't be able to fund permanent work from disasters that has not yet been started. ""We are postponing the permanent work,"" he said. But search-and-rescue teams are on the ground, he said, and food and water is being handed out to those in need. ""This is a team effort,"" he said. ""... Americans help Americans in disasters. We're doing our job. We're working hard."" Mayor Jeffery Jones of Paterson, New Jersey, said he was ""outraged"" about the funding dispute. ""Mother Nature has a mind of her own, a will of her own, and we can't have the petty wrangling going on when we have folks in dire need,"" he said. Gov. Chris Christie echoed those sentiments during a news conference Wednesday, saying, ""We don't have time to wait for folks in Congress to figure out how they want to offset this stuff with the budget cuts. Our people are suffering now. And they need support now."" ""Nobody that got hit with this flooding dodged a bullet,"" Fugate said Wednesday. ""Loss of life, extensive damages, homes flooded. ... It may not have been as big a deal on the coast, but these flood areas definitely got hit hard."" Irene killed 43 people from Florida to New England as it marched up the Eastern Seaboard over the weekend, dumping torrential rain. Some of the worst flooding struck Vermont, New Jersey and upstate New York. More than 1.8 million customers remained without electricity Wednesday from North Carolina to Maine, the U.S. Department of Energy said -- a decrease from the 2.8 million reported Tuesday afternoon. Outage figures include more than 366,000 in Connecticut and 323,000 in New York. The Passaic River in northern New Jersey seemed to mock the town of Little Falls as the water surging through it looked more like Niagara Falls. ""Before Irene hit, the Passaic River was already running high from frequent precipitation this summer,"" Wheeler Antabanez of neighboring Montclair said.  ""When the hurricane blew through and dumped all that water on north Jersey, the river began to rage."" About 1,700 residents were evacuated from their homes in Wayne, Totowa, Little Falls, Paterson and Woodland Park, said Edward O'Connell, a spokesman for Passaic County's Office of Emergency Management. President Barack Obama will travel to Paterson on Sunday to view damage from Hurricane Irene, the White House announced. Rescues were still taking place Wednesday, Jones said. ""All it takes is someone to call and say they're under distress, and we and our boats are going out and taking people to safety,"" he said. City officials were opening schools and other facilities to serve as shelters, he said. ""It's been pretty much 24 hours a day,"" said Sgt. Alex Popov of the Paterson Police Department. Once floodwaters begin to recede, the next step will include going house to house and checking furnaces, hot water heaters and other appliances to reduce the risk of explosions when they are restarted, Jones said. Asked about those who did not heed an evacuation warning, Jones said, ""I don't think folks were aware -- nor were we aware -- that it could get this extreme."" Flood warnings remained in effect for portions of New Jersey on Wednesday, along with parts of North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Also Wednesday, Obama signed disaster declarations for New Jersey, North Carolina and New York. ""I think the conversation of hype is being hyped,"" Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Wednesday on the debate over whether Irene was overhyped. ""The reality is, the people of Connecticut are hurting. ... Although it's sunny outside, we're still experiencing the effects."" He said homes and infrastructure have been destroyed and the Connecticut River basin has experienced heavy flooding. Much of the damage is seen in the state's rural areas, he said. ""We have farms that are under water."" Consolidated Edison reported that it met its goal to restore power to nearly all New York City customers by Tuesday night, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement Wednesday. Work to restore power elsewhere was ongoing Wednesday. The full extent of Irene's destruction won't be known for some time. The federal government estimates that the cost from wind damage alone will exceed $1 billion. Analysts have put the total expected cost of Irene much higher. Vermont transportation officials were able to make emergency repairs on roads to all but one of about a dozen previously isolated towns, officials said. Air drops were being made to three towns. The National Guard is carrying supplies to other communities, said Mark Bosma, spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management. Because the repaired roads are intended for emergency and supply delivery traffic, residents will have to wait for more permanent repairs to resume their old driving habits. That is expected to take at least several weeks or months in some cases. ""We've transitioned into the recovery stage for the most part,"" Bosma said. ""The worst is over."" The Vermont Campground Association reported that only two of its seven member campgrounds suffered significant damage, and more than 70 campgrounds will be open for the coming Labor Day weekend. ""Some are cleaning up downed trees, but most are ready for visitors,"" said Peter Daniels, the association's executive director, in a prepared statement. Most roads leading to campgrounds are open, the association said. The two campgrounds that suffered extensive damage -- Camping on the Battenkill in Arlington and Abel Mountain Campground in Braintree -- remained closed. Storm cleanup efforts also were ongoing in the Bahamas on Wednesday, a week after Irene struck there. The National Emergency Management Agency was coordinating the shipment of goods to Rum Cay, Cat Island, Crooked Island and Acklins, according to Bahamas Information Services. A shipment of goods from Jamaica was received by Mayaguana on Saturday. Meanwhile, some of the areas that escaped Irene without major damage -- such as the state of Maryland -- still took a direct hit in the pocketbook. Maryland lost more than $2 million in direct revenue over the past weekend, including an estimated $1.75 million in sales tax revenue and $150,000 in withholding taxes due to the evacuation of Ocean City, according to Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot. Officials estimated a $60,000 loss in gas tax revenue because of canceled weekend trips, and a loss of roughly $45,000 in toll revenue from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Additionally, Ocean City lost nearly $40,000 of admissions and amusement tax revenue from its many attractions and events . But Franchot did not question the decision to evacuate the town. ""Given the disastrous impact of this storm on other parts of our country ... am profoundly grateful that Ocean City and the state of Maryland as a whole weathered this storm with minimal injury or loss of life,"" he said in a statement.

1319,"Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Firefighters have made some progress in battling a spreading wildfire in northern Texas, but dry conditions contributed to a rash of new fires as well, officials said Thursday. The 101 Ranch Fire in Palo Pinto County had scorched 6,200 acres as of Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The blaze is burning on Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. However, ""we feel much better about this fire today"" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, spokesman for the forest service. Some evacuations were lifted, he said. The flames have destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are working on a re-entry strategy for residents, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer, and they are trying to get the lake open for the Labor Day holiday. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the flames. Tom Hardeston was among the residents watching helplessly. ""My house is right through here, though it may be gone,"" he told WFAA. Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire. ""I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture,"" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock. ""As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around."" The Forest Service responded on Wednesday to 17 new fires burning a total of 4,146 acres. The largest of those is the Hornets Tank Fire, which had burned 3,000 acres and was 40% contained Thursday. It was burning in Briscoe County near Palo Duro Canyon, the nation's second-largest canyon behind the Grand Canyon. In addition, the Legacy Fire had burned 3,400 acres in Howard County and was 10% contained Thursday, the Forest Service said. The blaze threatens numerous structures, but did not show much growth on Wednesday. The weather forecast continued to predict mostly dry weather for the area, with high temperatures from the mid-90s into the 100s, the Forest Service said. Texas is experiencing the worst fire season in state history. Since fire season began last November, a record 3.5 million acres have burned. Hot and dry weather combined with a historic drought have made conditions ripe for rapid fire growth. In the past seven days, the Forest Service has responded to 224 fires burning a combined 31,541 acres. Meanwhile, in neighboring Oklahoma, firefighters were battling hot spots Thursday from a wildfire in northeast Oklahoma City, Fire Chief Keith Bryant said. National Guard helicopters were assisting, Bryant said. The blaze was one of two large brush fires that had covered more than 16 square miles on the city's north and south sides Wednesday, forcing some evacuations and closure of Interstate 40 and the Turner Turnpike. Both roads were later reopened, CNN affiliate KOCO said. Thursday is ""day three of very poor fire conditions for us,"" said David Barnes, Oklahoma County Emergency Manager. Firefighters, including some from around the state, are ""kind of ragged,"" he said. Barnes did not have an estimate on how many homes were lost on the city's north side. On Tuesday, a dozen were lost in that blaze. Fighting the south side fire ""went very well for us,"" he said. Three or four barns were lost, he said, along with one mobile home and one abandoned home. The record-setting heat and drought plaguing Texas and Oklahoma -- as well as a heat wave experienced by other states -- result from abnormally strong high pressure over the Atlantic and Pacific. The high pressure keeps the jet stream, typically a source of cooler air and precipitation, to the north, while winds funnel hot, tropical air into the south-central United States, according to NASA, which released satellite data Wednesday showing the phenomenon during July. But the conditions persist, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. ""The ridge of high pressure aloft refuses to release its grip. There are some subtle signs that it may weaken into next week and allow a tropical system to move into"" southeastern Texas, he said. ""This would have the potential to bring some very significant and beneficial rains to that area. But it looks like Oklahoma is going to remain high and dry.""","The 101 Ranch Fire is 50% contained .

1320,"(CNN)  -- Two-time defending champion Kim Clijsters has pulled out of this year's U.S. Open with a stomach muscle injury. The 28-year-old Belgian suffered the injury at the Rogers Cup tournament in Toronto last week and told the official WTA website that she would not be able to recover in time for the final grand slam of the season which starts on August 29 in New York. ""Two weeks of rehab was not enough to heal this injury. Obviously I'm very disappointed,"" she said. ""I trained very hard this summer and felt in a good shape to play the U.S. Open."" Clijsters, the world number three, has suffered an injury-hit year since claiming the Australian Open title back in January, her fourth grand slam crown. She missed most of the clay court season and then Wimbledon with an ankle injury and was hoping for better luck as she chased a fourth triumph at Flushing Meadows where she won in 2005, 2009 and 2010. The injury will also affect her end of season campaign and she acknowledged that she will need careful rehabilitation. ""Now there is nothing else I can do than to rest and have treatment every day. ""If a gradual approach is not taken, I will relapse in the same injury, and therefore I have also no other possibility than to withdraw from the tournaments in Tokyo and Beijing."" Clijsters' withdrawal is likely to leave Serena Williams as a warm favorite to add to her grand slam tally, but the American was herself forced out of the latest WTA event in Cincinnati through injury, but it is not thought serious. Meanwhile, Wimbledon runner-up Maria Sharapova eased into the semifinals of the tournament in Ohio Friday with a straight-sets victory over Samantha Stosur. Fourth seed Sharapova beat the 10th-seeded Australian 6-3 6-2 and next faces second seed Vera Zvonareva of Russia, who battled past unseeded Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova 6-3 7-6. Ninth seed Andrea Petkovic also reached the semifinals with a 7-5 6-1 win over Nadia Petrova. Petkovic will face 13th seed Jelena Jankovic, who went through when Shuai Peng withdrew before the start of their match with a hip injury.","Kim Clijsters pulls out of U.S. Open with an abdominal injury .

1321,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The closure of a mountain highway pass in the heart of the nation's second-largest city -- an event anticipated to be so calamitous to car-loving Southern California that it's been dubbed ""Carmageddon"" -- hit the area Friday night. Crews began closing ramps late Friday on Interstate 405, where it passes over the Santa Monica Mountains, California Department of Transportation officials said. At about 10 p.m. Pacific, crews began closing lanes, and by midnight, the 405 was expected to be eerily vacant -- a ""carpocalypse,"" some say. It is expected to remain that way for about 53 hours. The moment ""Carmageddon"" began. Rendered desolate will be a 10-mile stretch of all five northbound lanes and a four-mile stretch of all five southbound lanes, officials said. The 405 is usually one of the busiest freeways in the country, carrying about 500,000 cars a day through the Sepulveda Pass, a critical artery connecting Southern Californians to destinations up the coast. The 405 achieved notoriety on national television as the corridor that former NFL player O.J. Simpson used as he was being slowly chased by police in 1994. The highway also cuts through the west side of Los Angeles, an area that includes the high-status communities of Bel Air, Brentwood, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said officials carried out ""an unprecedented"" public awareness campaign urging motorists to stay off the road or use public transportation. ""It doesn't have to be 'Carmageddon.' That's why we have done so much outreach to the public,"" the mayor said Friday. The weekend construction project should be completed by 5 a.m. Monday, to accommodate the morning rush hour, officials said. The $1.2 billion construction project calls for replacing a portion of a bridge at Mulholland Drive, a mountain summit road that is featured in many Hollywood films, authorities said. A year from now, crews will have to shut down the 405 again to replace a final portion of the Mulholland Drive bridge, officials said. The project also calls for adding a car-pool lane in each direction, creating ""the largest HOV system in the world"" at 48.6 miles in length between the San Fernando Valley and Orange County, said Mike Miles, the California Department of Transportation's director for Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. The two-year project will replace two more bridges, also to accommodate the widening of the 405, and will improve about two dozen on-off ramps and add 18 miles of sound-deadening walls for nearby residents, Miles said. ""This is a big project that is much needed, and it will be a great benefit to the public,"" Miles said. Whether it has been overdramatized by locals in the nation's entertainment capital, the project has brought countdown clocks, traffic apps, detour maps and warnings to stay away or enjoy the weekend on the couch. Amtrak and JetBlue are offering specials to get away from it all. ""Severe traffic conditions are anticipated in local and regional areas during the weekend of the full freeway closure,"" Metro warns on its website. The four-mile southbound section will be closed between U.S. 101 and Getty Center Drive ramps. The 10-mile northbound section will be closed between U.S. 101 and Interstate 10. Los Angeles International Airport is urging travelers to get there by public transit, especially rail, or to stay at nearby hotels for early morning flights. The Los Angeles Fire Department is adding 200 firefighters so it can quickly respond to 911 calls in the areas affected by the closure, CNN L.A. affiliate KABC reported. Of course, it may not be all bad. Villaraigosa's Facebook page links to ""405 Things to Do,"" brought to you by the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""The 405 closure is the perfect opportunity to discover ... and rediscover ... the great activities, restaurants, shops and sites close to home in the many unique neighborhoods of Los Angeles County,"" the page touts. ""Over the next few days leading up to the 405 closure, we will be adding 50 suggestions per day."" JetBlue is offering $4 fares each way from Burbank to Long Beach on Saturday and Sunday. Amtrak California offers coach passengers a 50% discount on trains traveling between Los Angeles Union Station and Burbank Bob Hope Airport. There is an app, or several, for ""Carmageddon."" KABC has partnered with Waze to help navigate the traffic. ""The app provides free turn-by-turn GPS navigation based on the live conditions of the road,"" the station said. Celebrities are even tweeting -- cheekily -- about this weekend's affront to the Los Angeles driving experience. Twitter titan and actor Ashton Kutcher has gotten into the act: ""LAPD askd me 2tweet: 405fwy btwn 10 & 101 will b closed July16-17. In xchange I would like a free pass on that stoplight tickt IT WAS YELLOW."" When shown a copy of the tweet while he was being interviewed on CNN, the mayor laughed about the request to fix the ticket. ""No, thank you, Ashton,"" Villaraigosa said. For those venturing out, it's all about the proper attitude. The Automobile Club of Southern California, while urging motorists to stay away from the construction zone, has provided tips for those driving Southern California roadways this weekend. It suggested leaving home early, listening to calming music and news updates, or stopping at a restaurant or park for a break, if necessary. ""Avoid directing anger at other drivers, even if they are discourteous or distracted,"" AAA said. ""Concentrate on your own driving."" CNN's Zohreen Adamjee contributed to this report.","NEW: Ashton Kutcher tweets about Carmageddon in exchange for traffic ticket fix, he says .

1322,"(CNN) -- Funeral services will be held Monday morning for a Texas man who died at a baseball game last week. Shannon Stone will be buried in his hometown of Brownwood, Texas. The 39-year-old firefighter fell to his death Thursday while trying to catch a ball at a Texas Rangers game. Ronnie Hargis was seated in the stands near Stone and tried unsuccessfully to save him. ""Your first instinct is to reach out and grab him,"" Hargis told CNN's Don Lemon. ""I tried to grab him. I couldn't catch him. He went down. As he went by me I tried to grab him again and I missed and ... it looked like he was in slow motion as he was going to the ground. There was nothing I could do but watch him fall."" In the second inning of the ill-fated game, star outfielder Josh Hamilton tossed a souvenir ball into the stands after a batter hit a foul ball. Stone stuck out his glove and reached for the ball, but lost his balance and flipped over the railing of the outfield seats. He fell about 20 feet and crashed head-first into a scoreboard, suffering fatal injuries. Stone died of blunt-force trauma, according to the Tarrant County medical examiner. His 6-year-old son, Cooper, witnessed the tragic accident. ""It's just the cruelest of reminders of just how fragile human life can be,"" said Joe Trahan, sports anchor at CNN-affiliate WFAA. ""The mind-boggling thing about this is that everyone's intent was right."" Trahan provided details of the incident for Lemon. ""Josh Hamilton flipped a foul ball up to a little girl an inning or so earlier,"" Trahan said. ""And he heard at that point Cooper Stone ask for a ball. Most of the time, big-leaguers wouldn't even hear that, but he made a note of it, he's trying to do the right thing."" Rangers president Nolan Ryan, a Hall of Fame pitcher, said earlier that the club would review the height of railings at the stadium, even though they currently exceed the city's code limits. Trahan told Lemon that club management is already working on making changes at their stadium. ""I've spoken to Rangers officials, and they tell me that there are meetings that have already taken place with city leaders, meetings with architects at the ballpark, contractors. They're trying to find a permanent solution, not a stop-gap one."" But fan-awareness also plays a crucial role at stadiums, according to Trahan. ""This is a stark and cruel reminder that (safety) is everyone's responsibility when you go to the ballpark,"" he said, adding that he was surprised that injuries didn't happen more often, especially ""down the first and third base lines ... those are rocket shots coming off those bats."" But Trahan also said that the accident should be kept in perspective. ""We go back to the unexplainable issue of why this happened, because there have been thousands and thousands of balls hit in that area, people with gloves trying to get balls and nothing has happened until now."" The Rangers held a moment of silence before Friday night's game against the Oakland A's. Members of both teams wore black ribbons. Flags at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington have flown at half-mast all weekend. The team has set up an account accepting donations in Stone's honor with the Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation. Donated money has been earmarked to help the Stone family. The Rangers have donated an undisclosed sum, according to the team's website, and the A's donated $5,000.","Shannon Stone died after falling over railing at Rangers Stadium .

No specific details of the attack have emerged, though it did happen somewhere in England. He was treated for the injury in Malmö, Sweden, where an x-ray revealed a fractured index finger on his right hand. Photos: Morrissey . Despite the injury, Morrissey will roll on with his European tour, which will resume with a show tonight at the Operaen in Copenhagen, Denmark. Perhaps Danish fans will be treated to an oldie with reworked lyrics commenting on the dog attack -- ""Heaven Knows I'm Rabid Now,"" ""The Boy With the Dog in His Side,"" ""Sheila Take A Bow Wow,"" or something like that.

1325,"Bethesda, Maryland (CNN) -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced Thursday a recall of pourable gel fuels used in outdoor decorative lighting because of burn and flash fire hazards. The voluntary recall, ahead of the Labor Day weekend, covers about 2 million bottles and jugs of gel fuel, and it follows a similar recall and warning in June. Incidents of flash fires and burns have been reported when consumers add the gel to an already burning fire pot. The CPSC says the agency has received reports of at least 65 incidents, including two deaths, 75 injuries, and 34 victims hospitalized with second and third degree burns. Because of the alcohol base of the product, the CPSC says the fires spread easily, sometimes resulting in injuries to more than one person, and they are difficult to put out. ""The standard way of putting out flame doesn't work. Water very rarely works. Patting it or smothering the flame does not work. So you have to use a dry chemical extinguisher to get the flame out,"" CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum told CNN. The nine manufacturers and distributors involved in the voluntary recall include Bird Brain, Bond Manufacturing, Sunjel, Fuel Barons, Lamplight Farms, Luminosities, Pacific Decor, Real Flame, and Smart Solar USA. CPSC said a tenth manufacturer, Marshall Group, backed out of a recall agreement at the last-minute. Tenenbaum also said the nine companies agreed to recall the items only if the CPSC would not show a video made in their laboratory of the products exploding. The recalled gel fuel has been sold by retailers since 2008. The CPSC and Napa Home & Garden recalled 460,000 bottles and jugs of gel fuel in June, and the CPSC recommends the removal of all remaining gel fuel stock from store shelves.

1326,"(CNN) -- An 8-foot-long alligator sank its teeth into a 90-year-old woman's leg and tried to drag her into a canal in southern Florida, a spokeswoman for the state's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said. Margaret Webb was walking in her flooded yard Wednesday in rural Copeland, Florida, about 80 miles west of Miami, when the alligator lunged at her and grabbed her by her left leg, commission spokeswoman Gabriella Ferraro said. Dewain Daniels, who was driving by, stopped to help the woman, Ferraro said, and pulled her out of the water away from the alligator. But that didn't stop the huge reptile, which tried to come out of the water three times. Daniels shot the alligator between the eyes with a .22 Magnum rifle, according to the incident report from the wildlife commission, and it retreated into the water. Webb was airlifted to Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers, where she's in critical condition after having her left leg amputated below the knee, Ferraro said. She's also being treated for a bite on her right leg. Ferraro said alligators are the most active at this time of year, while water levels are at their highest, but unprovoked attacks are rare. In 2010, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reported six unprovoked attacks in the state. Ferraro said the elderly woman, whose home is next to the Florida Everglades, is no stranger to alligator attacks. ""There are reports she has lost pets to alligators,"" she said. Two wildlife officers and trapper David Regel returned to the site of the attack early Thursday morning to search for the alligator in the canals surrounding Webb's home. Ferraro said it's not clear what became of the gator. ""We don't know if it's alive or dead or injured.""","The woman, who has lost pets to alligators before, lives near the Everglades .

1327,"Washington (CNN) -- National Museum of American History Curator Peter Liebhold describes the day several years ago he spent going through shipping containers filled with debris from United Airlines Flight 93 as ""overpowering,"" even though more than a year had passed since September 11, 2001, when the plane crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. ""Going through the debris of an airplane was certainly an experience that I've never had before,"" said Liebhold, one of three curators from that museum who focused on gathering 9/11 artifacts full time. A special exhibition commemorating 9/11 with the results of their work will open at the museum on Saturday. They were granted access to the materials from Flight 93 after the FBI had finished analyzing them as crime-scene evidence. ""The material was stored in ocean-shipping containers and we opened them up -- I guess we weren't really prepared for how small the bits would be,"" according to Liebhold. ""It smelled of jet fuel, of moldy cloth and paper and just sort of mysterious odors that were -- I guess in all honesty -- plain scary,"" he said. Liebhold and his fellow curators by this time had an idea of what the items they would seek as they dug through the plane debris. ""One of the big stories on Flight 93 was that unlike the other flights (hijacked on 9/11), it was delayed in taking off and the hijacking happened a little bit later,"" the curator said. ""The passengers knew what their fate was going to be through cell-phone communication. People had talked to people on the ground. So finding a cell phone was something we really sought, to tell that story of how people became informed and what helped motivate them to action."" They found a GTE phone that has become part of the Washington museum's permanent exhibit on 9-11. The curators also collected a gauge from the flight panel of United Flight 93, as control of the plane itself was part of the story. They also tried to find items that would represent the people who were on the plane, such as seat belts that had been torn in the crash. And, they found a part of an American flag. ""Every United Airlines plane over the exit door has a small American flag painted into the fuselage and we found the red-and-white stripes of the flag,"" Liebhold said. ""For me, one of the strongest icons is one of the simplest and smallest. And that's the little orange call button that I never really paid attention to,"" he said. ""There was this small little orange button and it's chipped and it's scratched but it's a picture of a person and in a sense, it's asking for help."" The curators were granted a single day to go through the Flight 93 containers. At the end of the day, they threw away the clothes they had been wearing during their search, as the clothes smelled like that strange odor from the container. Liebhold said that during the height of their collecting, he and his colleagues also communicated with family members and others affected by the attacks, to ask for other items related to September 11. But, they always worked through an intermediary so that those affected would be comfortable turning down their requests and would not have to say no face to face. ""It's difficult to know where the boundary between history and current event is, and when you are collecting something that is a current event, you're emotionally tied to it and it's difficult to have any kind of distance to understand it,"" Liebhold said. ""But, so much of it is parting -- if you don't act fairly quickly, it could easily be gone forever."" More than 50 9/11 artifacts collected by curators from the American History Museum will be on display in a special exhibition called ""September 11: Remembrance and Reflections."" The items, collected from New York, the Pentagon and Shanksville, will be on display starting Saturday at the museum on tables, not behind glass, to give visitors a close-up, intimate view through September 11, 2011.","A special museum exhibition commemorating 9/11 opens in Washington .

1328,"(CNN) -- The global H1N1 pandemic is over, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization said Tuesday. ""We are moving out of the pandemic into the post-pandemic period,"" said Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO. Chan said that while several countries -- including India and New Zealand -- are still experiencing significant H1N1 flu transmission, out-of-season flu outbreaks are no longer being reported in the northern or southern hemispheres. ""This pandemic has turned out to have been much more fortunate than what we feared a little over a year ago,"" Chan told reporters in a news conference Tuesday. She attributed the end of the pandemic to several factors: that the virus did not mutate to a more lethal form, the H1N1 flu vaccine proved to be a good match and widespread resistance to the antiviral drug Tamiflu did not develop. ""This time around, we have been aided by pure good luck,"" Chan said. The WHO announced the global H1N1 pandemic June 11, 2009. A pandemic is a sudden outbreak of a disease that is spread by human transmission, which quickly becomes widespread and affects a large region or several countries. The CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, said the U.S. Public Health emergency for H1N1 ended on June 23 of this year. H1N1 is no longer the dominating flu strain. Chan said health officials are now seeing a mixed virus pattern: In addition to the H1N1 strain, an H3N2 flu strain and Influenza B virus also are circulating. All three strains are included in the upcoming seasonal flu vaccine. So H1N1 is not gone, but as the WHO explains, the flu activity health officials are now seeing is typical seasonal flu activity. The CDC statement came after an emergency committee of the WHO said Tuesday the public health emergency triggered by the emergence of the H1N1 virus ""should be considered over."" The committee advised Chan ""that the world was no longer experiencing an influenza pandemic,"" the organization said in a statement. CNN""s Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","World Health Organization chief says the global H1N1 pandemic is over .

1329,"Madrid (CNN) -- A 24-year-old Australian man was gored in the thigh Friday, the second day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. At least three other runners went to hospital with injuries, officials said. The Australian man was gored in the bullring at the end of the course. One bull became separated from the pack and came last, and alone, to the bull ring. Television images showed the man coming up behind the lone bull, which then turned on the man, who suddenly slipped and fell to the ground. He was then gored in the thigh. He was immediately tended to the bullring medical staff. A hospital report on all the injured is due later. Four runners went to the hospital with injuries Thursday on the first day of the running of the bulls. Commentators on Spanish state television TVE considered it a relatively safe start to the dangerous annual tradition in Pamplona, which has tallied thousands of injuries and 15 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924, including the fatal goring of a Spanish man in 2009. The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title ""Fiesta."" It is now broadcast live across Spain by state television TVE, which pays Pamplona for exclusive rights, and positions some 20 cameras along the course. The daily run continues for eight days, through July 14, at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET). It is the highlight of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona that attracts hundreds of thousands to the nonstop fiesta.","The Australian man is gored in the bullring at the end of the course .

1330,"(CNN) -- A New York couple and their two daughters found dead in a suburban Baltimore, Maryland, hotel room died in what police believe was a murder-suicide, authorities said Tuesday. Stephanie Parente, 19, was found dead along with her sister and parents in a Baltimore hotel Monday. The bodies, found Monday at a Sheraton Hotel in Towson, Maryland, were identified as being those of William Parente, 59; his wife Betty Parente, 58; and their daughters Stephanie, 19, and Catherine, 11, said Baltimore County Police spokesman Cpl. Michael Hill. The family was from Garden City, New York, Hill said. William Parente was an attorney, he said, and Stephanie Parente was a student at Loyola College in Baltimore. Beyond saying the incident is believed to be a murder-suicide, Hill would release little additional information pending the completion of autopsies to be conducted Tuesday at the medical examiner's office in Baltimore. Detectives believe they know what occurred, he said, but are awaiting forensic evidence and autopsy results to back up their hypothesis before commenting publicly, Hill said. ""We don't have a motive for why that occurred,"" he told reporters. ""It's all very, very unfortunate."" He said the family frequently traveled to Baltimore to visit Stephanie Parente at school. As for a timeline for the deaths, Hill said police believe the family was together Sunday morning for breakfast, and they know what time the card key was last used to unlock the room. He would not give details regarding what, if anything, was found in the room. The bodies were found Monday after a housekeeper told hotel management about 3 p.m. that the door to the room was locked and there had been no response from inside, county police spokesman Bill Toohey said Monday. In an e-mail, the Rev. Brian Linnane, president of Loyola College, acknowledged the death of Stephanie Parente. ""This is a moment of unimaginable sorrow for the entire Loyola family,"" he said in the e-mail, addressed to members of the Loyola community. ""The loss of young lives -- particularly under such circumstances -- defies understanding. ... A tragedy such as this reminds us of the mystery and destructive power of evil in our world."" He urged members of the Loyola community to take advantage of grief counseling and support services, and said he would officiate at a special Mass Tuesday night for the Parente family. College spokeswoman Courtney Jolley told CNN that Stephanie Parente was a sophomore majoring in speech-language pathology with a natural-sciences minor. She was a former member of the women's crew team and coxswain for the men's crew team, Jolley said, and volunteered through the college's Center for Community Service and Justice. She had planned to study abroad in Newcastle, England, next year, Jolley said.","Four were found dead Monday in a Sheraton Hotel room in Towson, Maryland .

1331,"(CNN) -- Unexpected space debris came flying close to the International Space Station on Tuesday, prompting its six astronauts to take shelter inside two Soyuz capsules, NASA said. Russia's Interfax news agency said preliminary data on ""the dangerous approach"" shows that the ""trash"" came within about 250 meters (820 feet) of the station. NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries said it was not immediately known how close the debris came, but that 820 feet was the closest it could have come, according to NASA's projections. Officials at NASA are investigating what the debris was, NASA spokesman Joshua Buck said. By the time it was spotted, it was ""too late to make an avoidance maneuver,"" so NASA ordered the six crew members to ""shelter in place,"" Buck said.  About 7:30 a.m. ET, the crew members climbed into the two Soyuz capsules positioned at the station. NASA determined that the debris would come closest to the station at 8:08 a.m. ET. Three minutes later, at 8:11 a.m. ET, the all-clear was sounded and astronauts were allowed to exit the capsules, Buck said.

1332,"(CNN) -- Last week's tornado outbreak was the largest in U.S. history, according to the National Weather Service. At least 178 tornadoes tore across communities in 14 states and caused 327 deaths. Among the communities affected by the storms was Ringgold, a small town in northwest Georgia. Half of the town's businesses were damaged, and many homes were reduced to rubble. Ringgold, population 2,800, had limited resources to deal with the emergency until 2008 CNN Hero Tad Agoglia and his First Response Team rolled into town. With more than $1 million worth of specialized equipment, Agoglia's mobile response team has the tools and the experience to help communities recover in their darkest hours. CNN spoke to Agoglia about his group's recent efforts in Ringgold. CNN: Where were you when you heard about the storms, and why did you decide to come to Ringgold? Tad Agoglia: (We) had been in North Carolina for the past two weeks. We responded to a terrible tornado there that ripped through most of the state. All of a sudden, we're watching on TV one of the worst (tornado outbreaks) form in United States history, possibly. We knew there was going to be a tremendous amount of suffering, and we knew we had to respond. We decided to come to Ringgold, Georgia, because it's a small community, and most likely they didn't have resources they would need to deal with this type of storm. CNN: What kind of resources do you bring with you? Agoglia: When a disaster strikes, you don't really know what you're going to need, so you have to bring everything. That's why we've packaged up four tractor-trailers loaded with just about every type of tool and gear and piece of equipment. We have huge lighting systems and rubble cameras for search and rescue. We've got cranes and trucks to remove the debris from the road. We've got the (generators) to power up emergency rooms, nursing homes, shelters. We've got just about every type of cutting tool known to mankind -- plasmas cutters, concrete saws, metal saws, wood saws -- anything that you need to get through an area to get to the people that need help. We have seen just about every type and size of disaster imaginable. We can create a lot of progress really quickly in a lot of communities just by the experience we have and the equipment we have. CNN: What have you been doing since you arrived in Ringgold? Agoglia: We were able to get the church powered up and utilize it as a shelter. After that, we quickly moved in gear to start clearing roadways. Clearing roads is really important, because people can't get out if the roads aren't cleared. Ambulances and fire trucks need to get to home sites to perform search and rescue, so we help with that. This debris is really tricky stuff to deal with. When you look at a road and it's covered with houses and trees and cars -- just about anything you can imagine -- it's a little challenging to figure out how to clear that path. But we've got the equipment to be able to do that. So we just began to clear one road after the other. CNN: You've also been clearing home sites. How do you decide who to help? Agoglia: It was a little difficult to figure out where to start. It's just home after home, hundreds of them for miles and miles throughout this county and city. And so we decided to start helping families who lost loved ones in the storm. I literally just started walking up the streets. I started asking questions. ""Do you know anybody that's in need? Do you know any families that have lost loved ones?"" And the local community led me to Melba (Weese, whose father was killed). Not only were we able to go through the home site (where Weese's father lived) and find some of their precious belongings and clear the site, but we were also able to prepare the burial grounds for her and her family. CNN: This work is so physically and emotionally grueling. What keeps you going? Agoglia: This is part of being human. A lot of people think the government is supposed to help us or FEMA's supposed to help us, the White House in Washington will help us. But when we see people who are really suffering and struggling, it's our responsibility to come and to help. I'll come into a city, and I'll meet absolute strangers. And within days, they're kind of like friends and family. And it's hard when you look into their faces and you see the sadness and the loss, the shock and confusion. And all I can hope is that what we did makes a difference in their lives ... and hopefully others will also rise to the occasion, see the needs and do something about it.

1333,"(CNN) -- Six children ages 1 to 7 have been hospitalized for severe gastrointestinal illnesses after swimming this month in an Alabama indoor water park, a state health official said Friday. The children got sick after visiting the Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatic Center between June 12-18, said Dr. Mary McIntyre, medical officer of the Bureau of Communicable Disease at the Alabama Department of Public Health. The indoor splash park was closed Friday but the park's other facilities remained open, a park official said. Environmental officials will test chemical levels before the splash park will re-open, according to McIntyre. ""We are continuing to work with the medical community to identify the extent of the problem,"" she said. Five of the children have been transferred from East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika to the Children's Hospital of Alabama in Birmingham, where they were being treated with antibiotics, the official said. In a statement, the department of public health urged parents whose children who may have visited the park to contact the health department if they suffer symptoms of nausea, vomiting or severe diarrhea. Seven day-care centers took children to the Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatic Center for a day camp during the time frame officials have identified as when the water may have been contaminated, the health department said. ""We're recommending any children who did attend the splash park, until we can determine the full extent of the infection, not to swim in inflatable pools,"" McIntyre said. She added that such swimming could risk exposing other children to the bacteria. Illnesses linked to pools are commonly caused by germs spread through contact with contaminated water, the department said in a news release. E. coli infections are caused by bacteria that can be found in foods and stool. Children often become infected after being exposed to others who are not toilet-trained. ""It's not uncommon for recreational water illnesses to occur, particularly in the summer, because a lot of people are in the pools,"" McIntyre said. ""Children have a tendency to swallow water which is probably why we're seeing it in a younger group."" The health department warns people not to swim if they have diarrhea; to avoid swallowing pool or lake water; and to shower with soap before swimming so that germs and bacteria do not end up in pool water.","The 6 sickened Alabama children all visited Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatic Center between June 12-18 .

1334,"Aboard The Uss Wasp (CNN) -- -- Even before Hurricane Irene started thrashing the U.S. East Coast, the Navy prepared for what it could do if the disaster was even more catastrophic than it proved to be. As Irene strengthened and bore down on the United States, the Navy ordered 27 warships to sail out of its massive naval station in Norfolk, Virginia. Another 11 ships, already at sea on various duties, were told to stay out. ""Our first mission was to sortie the fleet and keep the fleet safe,"" said Capt. Brenda Holdener, commander of the USS Wasp, one of the ships that left Norfolk. Like Air Force bases that fly their planes west, moving ships to sea has become standard operating procedure for the Navy when major hurricanes approach. ""Ships are safer at sea than than are in port during a hurricane or heavy weather,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Timothy Reiswig, navigator of the Wasp. But when the Wasp, an amphibious assault ship, headed out of Norfolk, steering clear of Irene was just its first objective. The ship was also prepared to respond with a wide array of equipment and people to the hurricane zone if civilian officials asked for help. ""Over the years we've had so many hurricanes that devastate this country, you know we kinda get primed for being ready and responsive to it,"" said Rear Adm. Kevin Scott, commander of Amphibious Task Force 26, a unit that was created to be more prepared for hurricane response than any other Navy unit. ""What you are seeing is lessons learned from what has happened over the past few years, and realizing that the response that's required for a major catastrophe -- you know like Hurricane Katrina and Rita -- requires all the resources that the nation has to bear,"" Scott said. Those resources were focused on the Wasp, one of America's largest amphibious ships. The ship has a full-sized flight deck, capable of launching heavy-lift or search and rescue helicopters, and a dock inside its stern, capable of carrying and launching two huge landing craft. Those boats can move from inside the hull of the Wasp to just about any beach and unload some 160 tons of equipment, supplies or personnel. And not all the help has to go to shore. The Wasp, which normally carries Marines into combat, has a huge hospital deck. ""We have three operating rooms. We can expand to four. We have 15 ICU beds that you can see here, each one with it's own equipment, which is exactly what you would find in a normal ICU,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Juan Dapena, a doctor who is the senior medical officer on the Wasp. Dapena's regular medical staff was augmented by a surgical team that was prepared to go ashore to help with any medical emergencies. The ship also brought a group of Seabees, Navy engineers who are trained in disaster response. They brought along chainsaws, water pumps -- even a bulldozer. But putting this vast capacity of disaster aid to use depends on a twist of federal law. States can and did mobilize thousands of National Guard troops to help victims of Irene. But the Navy sailors involved in Amphibious Task Force 26 are active-duty military, and they can't just find a crisis and start helping. Under a system called Defense Support of Civilian Authorities, local officials who want help have to ask the federal government for it. The president would then issue an order to the military, which would trickle down the chain of command before the Wasp and other ships in the task force could go to work. This time, as bad as Irene was, state and local officials, as well as non-military federal agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, were able to respond without calling in the Navy. But Scott thinks even though his task force focused on practice training, that what he saw while at sea for the past week is evidence the Navy is better prepared than ever. ""Over the years we've just gotten better and better at it and poised to respond,"" Scott said. But to prove that the Navy has gotten better, that would likely require a disaster like Irene ... only worse.","The USS Wasp is one of America's largest amphibious ships .

1335,"(CNN) -- A deadly bacterial outbreak that has killed at least 23 people in Europe is limited to an area around the German city of Hamburg and does not require Europe-wide controls, a top European Union official said Tuesday. ""There is no reason as of today to take ... measures at (the) European level,"" EU Health Commissioner John Dalli said, adding, ""We consider any ban on any product as disproportionate."" A new death in Germany due to the E. coli outbreak was announced Tuesday, bringing the total there to 22. The other death, in Sweden, was of a person who had visited Germany. Top European farming officials met Tuesday in Luxembourg, where EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos proposed a 150 million euro ($220 million) compensation plan for farmers affected by the panic. But he said that offer may have to be increased in the face of complaints that it's not enough. Farmers are demanding compensation for losses due to being wrongly blamed for causing the outbreak. Spain alone seeks about $600 million in lost farm exports of cucumbers, tomatoes and other produce from the past few weeks, and farmers in Belgium, France, Holland and even Germany say they have millions of dollars in losses, too. Ciolos said the EU Commission may come back with an ""improved offer"" as early as Wednesday, and hopes to have a decision within days. But he said paying 100 percent of claims -- as some countries demanded at the meeting -- would not be possible given the EU budget restraints. ""The commission is assuming its responsibility within the limits of our regulation and of our budget,"" Ciolos said. The cause of the outbreak remains unclear, as new test results Tuesday proved negative. There was no trace of E. coli in a pack of bean sprouts in a household in Hamburg, where a man had become infected, health authorities there told CNN. The sprouts came from the farm which officials believe could be the source of the outbreak. But initial tests showed no sign of E. coli there, agriculture officials in the German state of Lower Saxony said Monday. But authorities said that does not mean their suspicions are not correct; they would not expect to find evidence of E. coli if the tainted sprouts were no longer in the supply chain. Test results are back for 20 of the 40 samples, Lower Saxony officials said Monday. It was not clear when the rest of the test results would be available. On Sunday, officials said German-grown sprouts are the likely source for the E. coli outbreak. ""There is a direct link between this company and these people getting sick,"" said Gert Lindemann, the agricultural minister in Lower Saxony. It was not clear how the rare strain may have gotten into the sprouts, officials said. E. coli has not been found in the company, Gaertnerhof, which has halted production and is recalling its products. Gaertnerhof, in the town of Bienenbuettel, said in a statement it was ""shocked and worried. ... that part of our production has been linked to E. coli infections"" and had never had a problem in its 25 years of growing sprouts. It said it had found no evidence of E. coli during routine testing in January or during tests last month in response to the health scare. But a leading German microbiologist said Monday that sprouts were a ""plausible"" source of the infection. Sprouts can harbor bacteria, which can spread during the growing process, said Alexander Kekule of the University of Halle-Wittenberg. ""Either it was inside the seed, which I do not think is the case, or the bacteria was inside the water,"" Kekule said on Germany's NDR radio. He is not working directly on the case. Sprouts are bred in drums that are heated to slightly warmer than body temperature -- ideal conditions for the growth not only of sprouts, but of bacteria, the agriculture ministry of Lower Saxony said. Authorities say the sprouts may have become tainted so long ago that trace-back tests may never identify the company as the source. But several restaurants and cafeterias linked to the outbreak got sprouts from the company, officials said. And two workers at the agricultural company have come down with severe cases of diarrhea; in at least one of those cases, E. coli was the cause, Lindemann said. Bienenbuettel is in the district of Uelzen in north-central Germany. Last week, Spain rejected suggestions that its cucumbers could have been the source after the European Food Safety Alert Network said E. coli bacteria were found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to various countries. Authorities initially called for the cucumbers to be pulled from sale. But Germany later said Spanish produce was not the source of the infection -- leading to the claims for compensation. Ciolos said that some farmers who belong to producer organizations might also find additional compensation there, and that some of those funds are also backed by the Commission. The Commission will need to document how the compensation money is paid out, he said. A growers' cooperative representative in southern Spain said earlier Tuesday that farmers around the town of El Ejido, a major year-round producer of fresh produce under expansive greenhouses, are busy filling out claims forms already. The outbreak of the virulent strain of E. coli has infected more than 2,400 people in at least 13 countries, European health authorities said Monday. The vast majority are in Germany, where doctors have found 630 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) -- a form of kidney failure -- in the current outbreak, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. That's more cases of HUS than in any other recorded outbreak worldwide. Fifteen patients in Germany have died of HUS, according to the center, while six died of enterohemorrhagic E. coli, a strain that can result in abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea and causes intestinal hemorrhaging. The center said 1,601 people have that E. coli strain but do not have HUS. Infections have also been identified in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, according to the organization.

1336,"Paris (CNN) -- Investigators trying to determine why an Air France plane crashed mysteriously two years ago have recovered the complete contents of the flight data recorder and the last two hours of cockpit conversation, they announced Monday. It will take several weeks to analyze the data, French air accident experts said. All 228 people aboard Air France 447 were killed when the Airbus A330 belly-flopped into the ocean June 1, 2009, in stormy weather. The cause of the crash is still not known. Discovering that there was data on the recorders ""is excellent news. It is really going to help us work out what happened on that plane,"" said Martine Del Bono, spokeswoman for France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA). Q&A: Will the mystery of Flight 447 be solved? The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were found at the beginning of May after an unprecedented series of submarine searches of a mountain range 3,900 meters (12,700 feet) under the ocean. They were brought to the surface and taken to Paris by ship and plane. The investigators also recovered two bodies from the fuselage -- after finding only about 50 bodies in the days immediately after the crash. They will not bring more bodies up from the ocean if they cannot identify the two they already have, they said Thursday. Those two bodies are being examined to see if there is enough DNA to identify them, investigators said, adding that they hope to have results by Wednesday. If they can identify the remains, they will consider bringing up other bodies from the wreckage. The bulk of the plane was located earlier this year and contains many more human remains, according to investigators. Recovering more bodies will be a difficult task, with miles of cable required to bring each one up over a period of three hours, they said. Investigators also brought an engine and an avionics bay containing computers to the surface, they said. The pilots of Air France 447 lost contact with air traffic controllers on June 1, 2009, while flying across an area of the Atlantic known for severe turbulence, officials said. But exactly what caused the plane to plunge into the ocean remains a mystery. The plane slammed into the water while en route from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, falling so fast that air masks did not have time to deploy. The fuselage was discovered in April with bodies still inside, investigators said. Some relatives of those who died have expressed reservations about remains being brought to the surface. Last month Robert Soulas, head of a support group for families of flight victims, said: ""For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed."" Other relatives have called for the bodies to be recovered.

1337,"(CNN) -- Waterlogged Vermont and northern New York braced for more rain a week after Tropical Storm Irene destroyed roads and sent floodwaters cascading into homes and businesses. A flash flood watch for the region has been issued for Sunday evening through Tuesday morning, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Abundant moisture from Tropical Storm Lee, moving up from the Gulf of Mexico, will interact with an approaching cold front to produce widespread rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches with localized amounts of 4 inches possible, Morris said. A flash flood watch means conditions may develop that lead to flash flooding. Although the forecast was too far out to show precisely where the heaviest rain might fall, ""it could be trouble,"" especially for the southern part of the state, said Mark Bosma, spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management. ""The ground is already saturated and some of the road beds have been washed out."" Irene killed 43 people from Florida to New England as it marched up the Eastern Seaboard over the weekend, dumping torrential rain. Some of the worst flooding struck Vermont, New Jersey and upstate New York. Swiftwater rescue teams have been put on notice, Bosma told CNN on Saturday. The state and towns are already in an emergency operations mode because of Irene. ""It's all hands on deck,"" Bosma said of road crews, which have been busy across the state with emergency repairs. National Guard engineers and other personnel, including a contingent from Maine, are working this weekend on bridges and thoroughfares. Towns are being informed of the latest weather conditions, Bosma said. Power outages in Vermont from Irene were down from a high of 50,000 to about 300 Saturday, he added.

1338,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson appeared to be dead when an ambulance arrived at his home at 12:26 p.m. June 25, 2009, according to a paramedic and a security guard who testified Wednesday. ""When I picked him up, his legs were quite cool,"" Los Angeles County Paramedic Richard Senneff said. ""His eyes were quite dry."" No pulse was detected, and the paramedics' heart monitor showed Jackson was ""flatlined"" as he lay on his bedroom floor, Senneff testified. Wednesday was the second day of testimony in a preliminary hearing to decide whether Dr. Conrad Murray will face trial for involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. Prosecutors contend that Murray's should be held criminally responsible for giving the pop star a surgical anesthetic, propofol, at home without monitoring equipment. The coroner concluded Jackson died from ""acute propofol intoxication,"" in combination ""the contributory affects of the benzodiazepines,"" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said. Murray allegedly delayed calling for help when he found Jackson was not breathing, misled paramedics and doctors about the series of sedatives and the anesthetic he'd given him and that he tried to hide evidence when he should have been trying to revive Jackson. Murray told paramedics he had only given Jackson a dose of lorazepam to help him sleep and that he was treating him for dehydration, Senneff testified. When he asked ""how long the patient was down,"" the doctor responded ""'It just happened,'"" Senneff testified. The paramedic, however, said ""it didn't add up."" Testimony Wednesday also included emotional accounts of crying and praying in the home as Jackson's children and employees realized something was very wrong upstairs. Jackson chef Kia Chase said the first indication of a crisis was when Murray ran downstairs in a panic and asked her to send Jackson's oldest son, Prince, and the security guard upstairs. ""His eyes were enlarged,"" Chase testified. ""He was screaming."" After the housekeepers started crying, the rest of the staff joined them, she said. ""We started praying,"" Chase said. ""We held hands, and we were crying."" Jackson's two oldest children, Prince and Paris, watched from a bedroom doorway as Murray tried to revive their father before the ambulance arrived, according to Alberto Alvarez, who worked on Jackson's security team. ""Paris screamed 'Daddy!' and she started crying,"" Alvarez testified. Michael Jackson's three sisters, parents and brother Randy listened from the second row of the Los Angeles County courtroom as Alvarez appeared to be near tears as he described the scene. ""Dr. Murray then said 'Get them out, get them out. Don't let them see their father like this,' "" Alvarez said. ""I turned to the children and I told them 'Don't worry, children, we'll take care of it. Go outside please.' "" Alvarez testified that Murray asked for his help in collecting medicines from around the bedroom. ""He then grabbed a handful of bottles or vials,"" Alvarez said. ""He instructed me to put them in a bag."" It was only then, about 21 minutes after prosecutors say Murray realized Jackson was not breathing, that he asked Alvarez to call for an ambulance. It arrived four minutes later. Jackson's former security chief testified that Murray seemed not to know how to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation as he waited for paramedics to arrive at the singer's house. Faheem Muhammed said he and Alvarez saw Murray crouched next to Jackson's bed ""in a panicked state asking, 'Does anyone know CPR?' "" ""I looked at Alberto because we knew Dr. Murray was a heart surgeon, so we were shocked,"" Muhammed said. When defense lawyer Ed Chernoff asked if perhaps Murray was only asking for help because he was tired, Muhammed said, ""The way that he asked it is as if he didn't know CPR."" Alvarez testified that Murray told him and Muhammed that he was inexperienced at mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. ""After the second time, he gave a breath, he said 'You know, this is the first time that I give mouth-to-mouth, but I have to do it, because he's my friend,' "" Alvarez said. Jackson appeared to be dead at that time, with his ""eyes open and his mouth open, just laying there,"" Muhammed said. Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Walgren earlier said that Murray used ""ineffectual CPR with one hand while the patient was prone on a soft bed."" Using two hands with the patient prone on a hard surface is the proper method, he said. Muhammed, testifying Tuesday, said he never saw Murray performing CPR on Jackson before paramedics arrived and transported the singer to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. The hearing, which began Tuesday, is expected to last two or three weeks, with 20 to 30 witnesses testifying. Judge Michael Pastor will determine whether there is probable cause to send Murray to trial. Murray remains free on $75,000 bond.

1339,"(CNN) -- Suspected arson at the future site of a mosque in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, has ""really raised the fear factor"" among area Muslims, a representative of the mosque told CNN on Monday. The Saturday morning blaze destroyed an earth mover and damaged three other vehicles at the future site of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro, said Camie Ayash, a spokeswoman for the center. The fire is under investigation, but ""you can reasonably make the assumption"" that it was deliberately set, FBI Assistant Special Agent Keith Moses said Sunday. ""The evidence is being analyzed to see what the origin of the fire was,"" said Moses, with the FBI's Nashville, Tennessee, bureau. ""We have to follow the facts."" Ayash told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday the incident has provoked mixed reactions in the community, but ""has really raised the fear factor for everyone. ... We see the different type of fear with our children. It is very hard to explain to children what is going on. It is hard to explain to the little kids when they ask you, 'Mommy, are these people for us or against us?' "" A candlelight vigil, organized by Middle Tennesseans for Religious Freedom in response to the alleged arson, was held Monday night in front of the Rutherford County Courthouse. Kyle Evans, spokesman for Murfreesboro Police, said about 100 people attended the vigil. He said a truck with three or four men drove up bearing a sign that said ""no mosque."" Joined by three or four other mosque opponents, the men debated with some of those at the vigil for about an hour, Evans said. Although voices were raised and there was some shouting, police did not interfere. ""We did not step in,"" said Evans. ""It was peaceful."" He added officers would have intervened if there were threats or physical altercations. The blaze is being investigated by the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office. ATF spokesman Eric Kehn told CNN on Monday night the investigation is continuing. ""We have no reason to think it's a hate crime,"" he said. ""We simply cannot allow the actions of a few destructive individuals to go overlooked by Rutherford County residents. It's truly a shame that we have reached this point, but it is up to us to ensure the intimidation goes no further,"" said Claire Rogers, spokesperson for Middle Tennesseans for Religious Freedom. Ayash said the Murfreesboro Fire Department told her the vehicles had been doused with an accelerant -- a substance, such as gasoline, that can help start or spread fires. She told CNN on Monday that she was notified of the fire about 4 or 4:30 a.m. Saturday. A passerby had seen the fire about 1:30 a.m. and called the fire department, she said. The lead detective told her that someone had opened the hood on the earth mover and set its engine on fire, she said. The other vehicles were doused with flammable liquid but not ignited. The detective speculated that the passerby might have spooked the arsonist, who fled, Ayash said. ""It really put fear into the community,"" Ayash said. ""Our children are heartbroken,"" she said. ""When we broke ground a few weeks ago, they could see the new Islamic center as something that was tangible, something that was going to happen."" ""Now someone had so much hatred to rip the joy out of their hearts,"" she said. The Islamic Center of Murfreesboro has existed in the Murfreesboro area for more than a decade, according to its website, and currently meets about a mile from the site of the future mosque. ""We have had members in our community in this area for around 30 years,"" Ayash said Monday. ""So all of this really took us by surprise."" The congregation purchased a 15-acre plot in 2009 and announced plans for a center that will include a mosque, educational facilities, a gym, cemetery and various recreational areas, including tracks, pavilions and a playground. The project has provoked controversy in Murfreesboro, about 35 miles southeast of Nashville, and statewide. In July, several hundred opponents of the mosque staged a march against the project. Some objected to Islam itself, carrying signs like  ""MOSQUE LEADERS SUPPORT KILLING CONVERTS,"" while others opposed the project for environmental reasons. Last month, Tennessee Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey publicly criticized the project. ""You could even argue whether being a Muslim is actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, a cult, whatever you want to call it,"" Ramsey, then a candidate for Tennessee governor, said at a rally. Ramsey placed third in Tennessee's Republican primaries earlier this month. ""I think a lot of this has to do with timing,"" said Ayash, who said her husband is a Muslim and she converted about 10 years ago. ""This was an election year. You had a lot of candidates running their campaign off of terrorism or things like that, so I think it had to do with timing and misinformation."" The community has an open-door policy, she said, and welcomes the opportunity to answer questions posed by members of the public about Islam.","NEW: Group holds candlelight vigil outside courthouse .

1340,"(CNN) -- A Taliban insurgent with a rocket-propelled grenade has painfully brought back the question: Is the U.S. strategy succeeding in Afghanistan? NATO officials said it was reportedly an RPG that brought down a military helicopter carrying 30 U.S. service members, 25 of whom were Special Operations forces, on Saturday. All were killed in the crash, along with seven Afghan troops and an Afghan interpreter. It was the worst single-day loss of American life since the start of the war in late 2001. Army Lt. Jarrin Jackson, who spent most of last year in eastern Afghanistan, said he believes in the counterinsurgency principles pushed by Gen. David Petraeus, who is now director of the CIA. He even wrote an essay about it in the online publication Small Wars Journal. The strategy boils down to this: Insurgents rely on the fear and intimidation of local citizens to keep control, so the counterinsurgency focuses on protecting local citizens from the Taliban and rallying them to the Afghan government. ""I don't want to downplay the role of taking care of bad guys,"" said Jackson, who was based in Khost province, a stronghold of the Taliban that has plenty of insurgents. ""We took on a lot of rockets and mortars. But the majority of my time in Afghanistan, I was not under fire. I was interacting with people over there. The more you do that, I would argue, the better results."" Jackson believes interaction is imperative, even with the constant uncertainty of whether the person you're talking to is a good guy or a bad guy. ""One guy might be favorable one week,"" Jackson said, ""but because I stopped his car for my truck to get over a ditch, that prevented him from getting to the doctor's office ... (and) now he hates the government. It's incredibly fluid."" Khost province shares a border with Waziristan, the region of Pakistan that has been a safe haven for jihadists. The U.S. believes that Osama bin Laden hid there for years after the September 11 attacks, and it has recently been a testing ground for Petraeus' counterinsurgency tactics. Jackson tried to put himself in the Afghans' shoes. He said he can imagine how he would feel if his country were occupied for a decade by a foreign army dressed, as he put it, like ""automatons."" So he tried to play against it. ""You'd walk up to somebody and say, 'As-salaamu alaykum.' 'Tsenga yee?' It's kind of like 'What's up?' "" Jackson said. ""It's like 20 different ways of saying hello. I would walk up to an old man, shake his hand, look him straight in the face -- with my sunglasses off, so he could see my eyes -- and we would be shaking hands for probably one or two minutes."" Jackson didn't mind looking goofy, fumbling with the Pashto language or trying to tell a joke. He said he was trying -- and trying gets across in any culture, even when you're part of a foreign army. He says the human part of his job -- finding out what villages needed to prosper and keep independent of insurgents -- was a little like living in a small town. ""You know the people you go to church with. You know that Ms. Johnson's dog went to the vet last week and Mr. Steve had to have surgery. You know those intimate details."" In Afghanistan, Jackson said, ""I could tell you when one guy's crops were going to be harvested. I could tell you in this village, they'd go to this house to worship instead of the mosque, because it had better heat. I could tell you what time prayer was going to be and who went to that mosque."" Jackson had been in the country for 10 months when he went into one village he didn't know well. He did what he always does when he visits a new place: He and his Afghan counterpart told the locals that they wanted to talk to the most influential person in the village. Out walked a decrepit old man with a long beard. It took him 15 minutes to come out of his house and into the square. He had several wool blankets around his shoulders, and he was carrying a gnarled tree branch for a cane. He sat down and rested his hands on the cane between his knees. Jackson says he felt guilty for pulling the old man out of his warm house, but the man started talking right away. ""He said: 'I have a problem. I know I'm about to die. This village does not have any leadership set up to succeed me, and I'm concerned.' "" Jackson said. ""Then he just sat there looking at me."" Jackson said he wasn't sure what to think of a village elder asking for help from a foreign soldier. The elder told him about how Taliban insurgents had recently killed three of his villagers and left their bodies to rot as a reminder not to cross them. He also told him about other problems. All the time they were talking, Jackson said, he was trying to figure out a way to help. He knew he couldn't really help in the long term, but the elder clearly ""wanted some kind of answer, some kind of solution."" Then something came to Jackson. He remembered a village elder just to the north named Mohammed. U.S. and Afghan troops had cleared out Taliban insurgents there the year before, and the village was prospering. Jackson asked the old man whether he knew Mohammed. The man said that he did but that he hadn't spoken to Mohammed in years. So Jackson took a chance. ""I said, 'If you know this guy, and this guy is succeeding, and you're both village elders in eastern Afghanistan, why don't you talk to each other?' "" Jackson said. The old man looked at him as though the idea hadn't occurred to him, but he liked it, Jackson said. Jackson then went to Mohammed's village and asked Mohammed to help his neighbor to the south. ""I go: 'You see how safe and secure your village is now? How much safer, how much more prosperous would it be if the village just south of it were just as strong and secure and prosperous as yours?' "" he said. Mohammed said he would do what he could to help. As Jackson was leaving, he saw two figures heading toward Mohammed's village. One was a young boy. The other was the old man carrying his gnarled tree branch. Three weeks later, Jackson shipped out of Afghanistan.

1341,"(CNN) -- The hijacked jet planes that roared out of a clear blue sky one sunny September morning 10 years ago killed nearly 3,000 people, but the hurt they did spread far beyond the immediate death and destruction at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The damage was mental, psychological, even spiritual. And the death of Osama bin Laden at the hands of U.S. special operations forces may help to start some healing, said Christian and Muslim religious leaders, relatives of victims, and a generation who grew in the shadow of 9/11. Mixed emotions about bin Laden's death: How should we feel? ""There is a sense that justice has been done,"" said Joel Hunter, senior pastor of the 12,000-member Northland Church in Orlando, Florida, and a spiritual adviser to President Barack Obama. ""There is a scripture, Genesis 9:6, that says, 'He who sheds man's blood, by man his blood be shed.' There is a certain kind of sense of relief that that has been accomplished,"" Hunter said. ""This man was symbolic of much that threatened our country and our way of life,"" the pastor said. Hunter also cited the verse promising that ""those who mourn will be comforted,"" saying they might ""find some sort of solace in this event."" Americans take to the streets amid news of bin Laden's death . Those verses are much more relevant than Jesus' admonition to ""turn the other cheek,"" he said. Victim's dad: Why I'm not celebrating bin Laden's death . ""That particular scripture has to do with insult and not with self-defense,"" he said. The terror attacks that bin Laden authorized are ""not even in the category of forgiveness,"" so killing him ""really is in a category that, for 99.9% of Americans, would be beyond question ... the right thing."" Morally OK to cheer? Diana Massaroli, whose husband died in the World Trade Center, certainly has no questions about it. Michael Massaroli, 38, was working for Cantor Fitzgerald on the 101st floor of the North Tower on September 11, 2001, when a jet plane slammed into the floors beneath him. His body was never found. His son was 6 years old at the time. His widow has been grieving ever since. But early Monday, at ground zero where the towers once stood, she said she was finally experiencing some catharsis. ""I'm missing him, but I feel that justice has been done,"" she said, holding a picture of Michael. ""I feel some overall calm that I haven't felt in 10 years. I never thought it would happen... never thought it would give me a feeling of closure,"" she said. Now, she added, ""I feel better ... like I can start a new chapter in my life."" We celebrated 'the death of my generation's face of terror' Relatives of the victims are not the only Americans feeling relief Monday morning -- American Muslims also hope the death of bin Laden will open a new chapter in history. The 2001 attacks opened a ""wound has never quite healed,"" said Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, formerly of the controversial Park51 Muslim community center planned for lower Manhattan, not far from the former site of the twin towers. ""The killing of Osama bin Laden is a major milestone,"" he said. ""It expresses the sense that there is a sense of healing beginning to take place."" Far from New York City, American Muslim lawyer Asma Hasan agrees that Osama bin Laden wounded the country's Muslims, but is not sure his death with heal anything. ""The 9/11 attacks changed my life forever in a very challenging way,"" said Hasan, who lives in Denver, Colorado. ""It's 10 years later and people still question us"" American Muslims. ""We have all had to become ambassadors for our religion, we have had to condemn every terrorist attack or be labeled a supporter of terrorism,"" she said. ""None of us can be a quiet person that just goes to our jobs, we have all had to become multifaith activists who reach out,"" said Hasan, the author of ""Red, White and Muslim."" ""I don't think the death of Osama will change that,"" she said. Steve Bernstein, whose older brother, Billy, worked in the World Trade Center, said he was ""very elated"" at the news bin Laden was dead. ""We have been waiting for this for a long time,"" he said. ""I felt that it was just a great moment for the country."" He said the scenes of jubilation across the United States should not be seen as people celebrating somebody's death, but as a recognition that ""everyone feels that capturing bin Laden or killing bin Laden was something that needed to be done."" Bernstein had another brother who also worked in the World Trade Center but left to go to the bank just before the first plane hit. ""He said as soon as he saw it, he knew"" Billy was dead, Bernstein said. Unlike some others in the towers, Billy Bernstein did not call to say goodbye, Steve Bernstein said. ""We never heard from him,"" he said. Hunting down bin Laden at last ""shows the strength of America, shows we're not going to put up with it,"" he said, adding it would ""make the terrorists think twice."" Bernstein was ""a little surprised"" bin Laden was buried at sea immediately after his death, he said, fearing it would fuel conspiracy theories. But in the final analysis, he said, ""the world can feel a little bit safer right now."" Another 9/11 widow, Kristen Breitweiser, said the death of bin Laden would change the world. ""My 12-year-old daughter will wake tomorrow to a safer world, hopefully a more peaceful world. And that brings me a rare sense of relief,"" she said in a statement, adding that she was ""enormously grateful for the tireless effort and incredible courage and bravery of our counter-terrorism agents. There were also more raucous celebrations going on at ground zero, including groups of young local men waving flags and chanting ""USA! USA!"" ""It took 10 years, but the fact that it happened today, we're all rejoicing,"" one of them told CNN, adding that ""everybody in America"" was celebrating the death of bin Laden. In Oxford, Ohio, Miami University student Mike Chase celebrated by shaving a friend's hair into the letters ""USA"" with two red stars. ""The announcement means that when we set out to accomplish something we follow through. It's a great milestone on the fight against terrorism,"" the 21-year-old said. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association hailed the ""annihilation"" of bin Laden as ""triumphant news."" ""I would say, 'May God have mercy on his hideous soul,' but I don't think he had one,"" the organization's president, Jon Adler, said. ""As we draw near September 11 and mourn the loss of our loved ones, let this victory remind all that the indomitable American will stands strong and eternal."" CNN's Eric Marrapodi, Jason Carroll and Ali Velshi contributed to this report.","The Bible clearly justifies the killing of bin Laden, a megachurch pastor says .

1342,"New York (CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that it will investigate what happened Monday night when a massive Air France jet clipped a smaller aircraft at John F. Kennedy Airport. The incident, caught on amateur video, shows the Air France Airbus 380 clipping the smaller plane,a Comair Bombardier CRJ-700, while taxiing to the runway for takeoff. CNN Correspondent Jim Bittermann, who was on the Air France flight headed to Paris, said that he felt a slight rumble -- akin to hitting a patch of rough pavement -- as his plane was moving on the ground Monday at about 8:15 p.m. The pilot then stopped the aircraft, which is regarded as the world's biggest passenger jet, and eventually fire department crews surrounded it and the other plane. The Airbus had 485 passengers and 25 crew members aboard when the incident happened. The Bombardier had 62 passengers and four crew members. No one was injured, the NTSB reported. The tail of Comair Flight 6293, a Delta Connection flight that had recently arrived from Boston, was struck by the Air France aircraft while waiting to park at the New York airport, said Delta spokeswoman Betsy Talton. When the Airbus abruptly flicked the smaller plane, it appeared to turn at roughly a 45-degree angle, according to amateur video of the incident. ""Send a truck. They just hit us,"" the pilot of the smaller jet calmly called out to controllers over the radio, according to a recording of airport radio traffic on the website liveatc.com. Looking out the window, Bittermann could see that the last foot or so of the Airbus 380's left wing had been damaged. The other plane also suffered some damage. ""You could see the part of the 380's wing hanging down from the horizontal stabilizer of the Delta jet,"" he said, having seen the damage firsthand from a seat on the larger plane's left side. The Federal Aviation Administration was notified about the incident, and Port Authority police detectives interviewed the pilots of both aircraft, the Port Authority spokeswoman said. Those on the Comair flight were later able to get off the plane normally, according to Talton. The Air France Flight 007 originally had been scheduled to take off at 7:15 p.m. for Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, according to that airline's website. But, after the incident, it turned around and all its passengers deplaned and picked up their baggage at the New York airport. Bittermann described passengers' mood aboard that flight as relatively light-hearted and calm after the pilot alerted them of what happened. The NTSB said it has asked for flight recorders from both airplanes and will also review air traffic control tapes and ground movement radar.

1343,"(CNN) -- Strong winds whipped up several wildfires in central Texas Sunday, threatening homes and forcing some residents to evacuate. The largest of the fires is in Bastrop County, southeast of Austin, said Lexi Maxwell, a spokeswoman with the Texas Forest Service. The blaze has so far scorched some 14,000 acres and is threatening about 1,000 homes, she said. It forced parts of state highways 71 and 21 to shut and additional road closures are expected, Maxwell said. Julian Ochoa, 23, was evacuated from a Bastrop subdivision Sunday afternoon. He said he grabbed his dog, a toothbrush, his birth certificate and a few pictures. ""It was like a storm coming through. You could smell the earth burning,"" said Ochoa, who doesn't know yet whether his home is OK or not. ""All of Bastrop is a giant smoke cloud."" Fires were also reported in Travis, Leon, Colorado, Burnet and Caldwell counties. About 190 homes were evacuated in Travis County. A spokeswoman at the American Red Cross said it had opened four shelters and anticipates opening more. ""They are coming in so fast. The intelligence is sketchy at this point. There's a lag of information,"" Maxwell said about the fires. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning Sunday across much of south, central and eastern Texas. A red flag warning means weather conditions -- mainly high heat, low humidity and strong winds -- pose an extreme fire risk. Sustained winds near 25 mph, with higher gusts, were forecast. Texas is currently battling its worst fire season in state history. A record 3.5 million acres have burned since the start of the season in November.

1344,"Joplin, Missouri (CNN) -- Chris Carriger is a 6-foot-1-inch, 250-pound police detective who served four tours in Iraq with the Missouri National Guard. But even someone with that size and life experience is no match for an EF5 tornado, as Carriger learned Sunday night when one struck his house in Joplin, Missouri. ""My feet were actually being pulled in the air,"" Carriger told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""I was just trying to figure out what I was going to do to keep there, and (I) just kept grabbing for the first thing I had. And that was the (bathtub) faucet. And basically, some debris fell on me and kind of held me down."" Carriger's home was one of about 8,000 structures destroyed by the twister's swirling 200 mph winds, City Manager Mark Rohr said, citing a Federal Emergency Management Agency report. The devastation ""looked like some of the things I'd seen in Baghdad,"" Carriger told Cooper, recalling his stints as a military policeman who came upon the aftermath of several firefights. Although Carriger lost his home, in some respects he's lucky. His wife was away at work when the tornado hit, and the two dogs in the house -- his family Havanese and a black Labrador K9 from work -- safely rode out the storm in a closet. Beyond that, Carriger says he's fortunate to live in a community where so many people are reaching out to help each other -- especially the newly homeless. ""We're staying wherever we can find with friends,"" he said. ""We've had numerous offers. (Joplin residents') friends and family are opening their homes."" Even with his home in ruins, Carriger went right back to work at the Jasper County Sheriff's Office, paying forward the kindness he has been shown. Officers are patrolling the devastated areas and enforcing curfews while the fire department searches for missing people. ""There are other people out here,"" Carriger told Cooper. ""We've got to get these people help, too."" While many trials lie ahead for the people of Joplin, Carriger is encouraged by everyone uniting for the better good. ""The American spirit is there,"" he said. ""It's strong. We'll get through this. We just have to bond together.""","Chris Carriger's house was one of thousands destroyed by a tornado in Joplin, Missouri .

1345,"(CNN) -- Complete this sentence: In the event of a loss of cabin pressure ... Air New Zealand crew members ""bared all"" for their preflight safety video to show they have ""nothing to hide."" If you guessed, ""oxygen masks will drop from above,"" you are not alone. Because the federally mandated preflight safety announcement is about as well known as the pledge of allegiance to many travelers, they immediately tune it out. So airlines are getting creative to grab passengers' attention. According to a 2001 National Transportation Safety Board study, 69 percent of passengers who completed the survey did not watch the entire safety briefing because they had seen it before or because they considered it common knowledge. How do airlines compete with more entertaining options, like texting or leafing through Sky Mall magazine? They are employing a variety of creative techniques, from naked cabin crew members to witty cartoons.  Watch videos of the creative tactics » . In late June, Air New Zealand rolled out a decidedly different approach to the preflight safety video for its domestic flights, and it doesn't leave much to the imagination. As part of its ""Nothing to Hide"" marketing campaign, which highlights the carrier's lack of fees compared with its so-called low-cost airline competition, the airline professionally body-painted five naked airline employees to perform the safety video with a pinch of cheeky humor, literally. ""We wanted to point out we have nothing to hide, and there are no surprises,"" said Steve Bayliss, general manager of marketing for the Auckland-based carrier. Set to a poppy song by New Zealander Gin Wigmore, the 3½-minute video debuted with much fanfare and a warm reception, Bayliss said. ""It was overwhelming, with 99.9 percent of the reaction positive,"" Bayliss said. ""What it has done for the airline was quite amazing. It was really innovative and shows we are up to trying new things."" Atlanta, Georgia-based Delta Air Lines made an attention-grabbing foray in May 2008 when it introduced a seductive flight attendant, nicknamed ""Deltalina"" by her fans because of her resemblance to actress Angelina Jolie, for its preflight safety video. The video has been viewed on YouTube more than 1.3 million times. But are passengers paying attention? While there is no hard data, Delta spokeswoman Susan Elliott says yes. ""We know they are paying attention because they are talking about it,"" Elliott said. ""The response from customers is overwhelmingly positive."" Delta will introduce a new version of the video in 2010 when the airline's merger with Northwest Airlines is completed. As for ""Deltalina,"" Elliott said only that she will ""very likely play some role"" in the new video. Companies must tailor their marketing efforts to our shrinking attention spans, said Larry Chiagouris, a professor of marketing at Pace University. Whoever delivers the most concise and compact information wins the consumer over, he said. ""We are now accustomed to getting our information fast and quick; as a result, we don't have the staying power to sit and listen,"" Chiagouris said. Cait Poynor, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Pittsburgh, said that as people's attention spans grow more divided, they can focus on only one thing at a time, making a company's goal to attract your attention more difficult. Poynor and Stacy Wood from the University of South Carolina are researching what companies are doing to draw people's attention to information they feel they already know. ""We don't pay attention because we already feel like we know everything that's being said,"" Poynor wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""We're unlikely to give our precious attention to that safety video."" As of Tuesday, Air New Zealand's safety video had racked up more than 4.4 million views on YouTube, giving the airline priceless viral buzz. But Chiagouris ""guarantees"" we won't see this type of buzz again for an airline safety video and believes that the standard preflight briefing won't be going away. Other airlines that have gone the creative route to spice up the monotonous preflight safety videos include Virgin America and its sister airline, Virgin Atlantic. They use sassy cartoons to explain the safety procedures. The short-lived carrier Independence Air employed celebrities and political pundits for its audio safety announcements. Southwest Airlines' flight attendants, who do not have video equipment on board, occasionally sprinkle their instructions with quips: ""If you are traveling with two or more children, please take a moment now to decide which one is your favorite. Help that one first, and work your way down."" In March, flight attendant David Holmes gained some fame when a passenger uploaded his preflight safety announcement rap. British charter airline Thomson Airways has kids brief passengers about safety requirements. Thomson said in a news release that its internal studies found a 15 percent increase in attention from passengers. Poynor said these creative methods will hopefully perk up passengers' attention spans. ""By doing this, they're hoping they can make consumers think, 'Hey, there might be something new here. I should pay attention,' and get just a little bit more of their resources,"" Poynor said. Bayliss, the Air New Zealand general manager of marketing, said companies need to adjust their marketing efforts, especially in the current consumer climate. ""The grand corporate brand is over,"" he said, referring to the buttoned-up appearance that airlines like British Airways uses. As for the future, Bayliss remained mum about what Air New Zealand will do next. But it's unlikely their employees will bare all again. ""If we do a plain old traditional video, our consumers will hang us up to dry,"" he said. ""The challenge is to come up with something to interest them.""","The preflight safety video may be too familiar to passengers .

1346,"(CNN) -- In true finale form, this week's testimony was emotional, drama-filled and, thanks in part to a spectator who made an obscene gesture at prosecutor Jeff Ashton, not without a few surprises. Even the weather set the tone, storming so loudly on Friday that the thunder could be heard inside the courtroom. After 33 days and more than 100 witnesses, the murder trial of Casey Anthony is inches from its end -- only Sunday's closing statements remain before the jury deliberates. On Thursday, the defense wrapped up its case after calling to the stand every member of the Anthony family this week except for Casey. She only made a cameo when she personally addressed the judge to answer one of the trial's biggest questions -- whether she would testify. She declined the opportunity to testify in her defense. Prosecutors allege that Anthony, 25, killed her daughter Caylee in 2008 by rendering her unconscious with chloroform, putting duct tape over her nose and mouth so she would suffocate, or a combination of the two acts. They also allege that Anthony stored the body in the trunk of her car for days before dumping it in the woods. Anthony faces seven counts, including first-degree murder, in the death of Caylee, whose remains were discovered in a wooded field in December 2008. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. Anthony pleaded not guilty, and her defense team asserts Caylee accidentally drowned in a pool in June 2008 at the Orange County home that Anthony shared with her parents. The defense team has argued that Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked on discovering the body and covered up her death, though George Anthony has denied that scenario. Caylee was not reported missing to police until July 15, 2008 -- 31 days after she was last seen alive. Casey's father, George Anthony, was a key player in the defense's final testimony, taking the stand twice during the final week. On Tuesday, he denied an affair with Krystal Holloway, a one-time volunteer in the search to find Caylee and the woman who claims George Anthony told her Caylee's death was an accident. George Anthony said his relationship with Holloway was platonic, and he only visited her apartment because she told him she had a brain tumor and needed someone to comfort her. Holloway testified the following day, retelling a conversation she alleges she had with George Anthony. ""He said it was an accident that snowballed out of control,"" Holloway said. ""But I was caught off guard with it and by the time I looked up he had tears in his eyes, and I didn't say anything after that."" Holloway stood by her version of the conversation even when Ashton, the prosecutor, confronted her with the differing statement she gave to police. She told police George said, ""I really believe that it was an accident, and it just went wrong and she tried to cover it up."" On Wednesday, questioning of George Anthony turned combative when lead defense attorney Jose Baez suggested he feigned support for Casey in jailhouse conversations while pointing the finger at her behind her back. George Anthony admitted he pulled Orange County detective Yuri Melich aside on July 15, 2008, the first night law enforcement visited the Anthony home. He admitted he told Melich the car smelled like decomposition and that his daughter was lying. ""Casey was the last one that I saw with Caylee,"" he responded angrily to Baez. ""One and one adds up to two, sir, in my mind, and no matter how you're trying to spin it I'm upset because my granddaughter is missing."" Wednesday also brought George Anthony's second denial of accusations that he molested his daughter as she was growing up, and a full breakdown when he recalled the day Caylee's remains were found. ""[I felt] a deep hurt inside, tears, the whole gambit of such an emotional loss, seeing what my wife went through, what my son went through,"" he said through sobs. The defense also suggested Wednesday that George Anthony attempted to take his own life in a hotel room in 2009 because he was overcome with guilt. He admitted he consumed a mixture of pills and alcohol because he ""wanted to be with Caylee."" In rebuttal, the state introduced into evidence George Anthony's eight-page suicide note, full of praise for his wife, longing for Caylee and lots of outstanding questions. ""I sit here falling apart, because I should have done more,"" he wrote. ""She was so close to home, why was she there? Who placed her there? Why is she gone? Why?"" Prosecutors argue these questions about her death prove George Anthony did not know how Caylee died, contradicting the defense's allegations that Caylee drowned and he helped cover it up. In the note, George Anthony also seems to express uncertainty about Casey. He closes the letter by saying, ""I Love you - Cynthia Marie...Caylee Here I come...Lee, I am sorry...Casey --"" In a move the defense hoped would highlight the Anthony family's dysfunction, the defense called Cindy Anthony, who during direct examination agreed she testified six months ago that she thought Caylee was still alive. ""There was still a part of me that believed Caylee was alive at that time,"" she said Wednesday. Cindy Anthony also played a role in the defense's unexpected final line of questioning -- the manner in which they buried their family pets over the past two decades. During testimony from George, Cindy and Lee Anthony, the defense suggested Caylee was disposed of in the same way the family buried their pets, wrapped in a blanket and placed in garbage bags secured with duct tape. During cross examination, prosecutors pointed out that Casey Anthony was also privy to the family's burial techniques. The defendant was in high school when their last pet died. Highlights of the week also included testimony from Anthony's former fiance, which the jury will never hear. With the jury out of the room, Jesse Grund testified that Anthony told him she was molested by her brother. ""She told me at one point in recent years that she woke up one night with Lee standing over her in bed asleep,"" Grund said outside the jury's presence. ""And in another instance was groping her in the middle of the night."" Judge Belvin Perry ruled the testimony was hearsay, and it was not admitted. Roy Kronk, the meter reader who discovered Caylee's body, also took the stand this week. Baez alleged in opening statements that Kronk is a ""morally bankrupt person who took Caylee's body and hid it."" Kronk denied moving the body or touching it before December of 2008, saying he spotted what he thought was a skull in August of 2008. After several unsuccessful attempts to direct police to what he thought could be the remains, he left the matter alone until December when he returned to the same area. ""I still didn't think it [the skull] was real so I very gently took it [the meter stick] and put it into the right eye socket and I gently picked it up,"" Kronk said describing the moments before he called police. ""I looked down and I realized what it was and I set it down as gently as I could."" The week came to a close Friday with the state's rebuttal. Witnesses included Cindy Anthony's former supervisor, who testified company records show Cindy Anthony was at work during the times the defendant's mother claims she was searching for ""chlorophyll"" on the family computer. Earlier, a computer forensics expert had testified that he found searches for ""chloroform"" among the computer's deleted files, but no searches for ""chlorophyll."" Court will resume Sunday with closing arguments. The jury is expected to begin deliberations Sunday evening. Watch Nancy Grace Monday through Sunday starting at 8 p.m. ET on HLN.

1347,"(CNN) -- A potential salmonella outbreak has prompted a multi-state recall of sprouts, an Idaho food company announced Friday. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration made a formal recall request Monday, urging on its website that people not eat alfalfa or spicy sprouts from Evergreen Fresh Sprouts. The federal agency noted that the salmonella Enteritidis pathogen is different from the E. coli bacteria that has been blamed for at least 47 deaths, and widespread recalls, in Europe. The next day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on its website there had been 21 reported cases of salmonella tied to the sprouts, which are also labeled as Evergreen Produce. Nine of those were in Washington state, seven in Montana, three in Idaho, one in North Dakota and one in New Jersey. Three of those people have been hospitalized, and there have been no deaths, according to the CDC. Those affected, ranging in age from 12 years old to 77 years old, fell ill between April 12 and June 7. A vast majority, 77%, of those who became sick were female, according to the CDC. The recalled sprouts were delivered to four distributors and three retail stores in Idaho and Washington state, Evergreen said in its press release Friday. They include 4-ounce, 16-ounce and 5-pound bags of alfalfa sprouts, plus 4-ounce and 16-ounce bags of spicy sprouts. The expiration dates for all the affected products are between June 22 and July 14. Evergreen said that authorities determined that all those who fell ill with the salmonella had eaten its sprouts. But the Moyie Springs company said that tests on its products are still pending, and no products have come back positive yet. According to its website, Evergreen has been family owned and operated since 1990. Besides vegetables, it also distributes fruits, dairy items, pastas and a host of other food products.","Evergreen Produce issues a voluntary recall of alfalfa and spicy sprouts .

1348,"Otsuchi, Japan (CNN) -- Kyoko Ogawa wore the brave face the world associated with Japan's tsunami survivors. The March 11 catastrophe washed away all her earthly possessions. She watched as her hotel burned to the ground in a gas explosion triggered by the tsunami; a hotel that had been in her family for generations. She was determined not to let the disaster break her. But after the elation of finding her son alive, the reality of losing her livelihood started to erode the calm facade. She was in turmoil. She was afraid to talk to other people about it because she knew everyone was suffering as much as her, if not more. They were ""ganbaru,"" she recalls -- enduring, holding on, withstanding, and living with the pain. She couldn't be the only one to lose control. ""I was in shock because I realized that all that was precious to me was gone,"" she says, six months on from that terrible day. ""I didn't know what to do from then on. I became tormented."" That was the start of a slippery slope down a dark trail of despair. It's a familiar story in Otsuchi, northeastern Japan, where the devastating earthquake and tsunami turned much of the town in Iwate Prefecture into rubble. Today, much of that physical debris has been cleared away. But the emotional wreckage of the survivors is proving much more difficult to remove, as the mental scars from that day linger months later. In Ogawa's case, depression could have had tragic consequences for her had she not met Suimei Morikawa, a volunteer psychiatrist who listened patiently to her troubles one day at an evacuation center. Morikawa became the difference between life and death. She says she probably would have ended her life if the doctor hadn't been there for her. ""I was so moved by her approach to life,"" recalls Morikawa. ""She may have been suffering and wanting to end her life because she had lost so much, but she also desperately wanted to get over that. I was moved by her willingness to get out of her own situation. I just helped her a little."" Concerns about suicide and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are growing among mental health specialists working in the region. PTSD in particular, a condition which can push people over the edge if not addressed, can show up months after the initial shock. Suicide is also a major concern in Japan. According to the World Health Organization, Japan has the fifth highest suicide rate in the world. More than 30,000 suicides are reported each year, according to the country's national police agency, with Iwate Prefecture -- one of the regions hit hardest by the tsunami -- having one of the biggest problems. Mariko Ukiyo, a psychologist and volunteer counselor, is part of a therapy group called ""Team Japan 300."" She and a number of other team members visit temporary villages in the devastated region hoping to treat symptoms of PTSD and ultimately prevent suicides. According to Ukiyo, loneliness and despair take hold when the survivors move from their evacuation center to temporary housing. ""It is only then that people see how their life has changed from their pre-disaster life,"" she says. ""The sense of loss and deep grief can overcome you quickly and if you are alone when that happens, you lose all hope for the future. I think this period is when they need help the most."" But getting help to the victims is proving to be a challenge in Japan, a country with limited experience in mental health care historically. Ukiyo says the amount of psychological support received by tsunami victims now is a tenth of what the victims of 9/11 in the United States experienced. According to Ukiyo, the devastating 1995 earthquake in the city of Kobe started to raise awareness about the effects of post-traumatic stress -- particularly among the younger generation -- but many Japanese continue to find it difficult to talk about sorrow and loss because of the shame of appearing weak. Ukiyo's strategy is to gather the residents in temporary housing for a regular get-together in a relaxed atmosphere. This gives her the opportunity to keep an eye on each of the participants, observing anyone that shows signs of severe distress. The hope is that what starts out as small talk will gradually evolve into people talking about themselves and their problems. But despite her efforts Ukiyo is not optimistic about the region's future with trauma. ""We are only now starting to hear about sick or depressed people six months after the tsunami,"" she says. She believes suicide rates will only increase. Meanwhile, Kyoko Ogawa vows not to be another victim. She says Dr. Morikawa pulled her back from the brink and she is now making plans for the future. She wants to rebuild her hotel and give back to those who helped her. While Ogawa is a success story for Morikawa, he worries about those he will never reach in this devastated region. ""Now that I have met these people, I have grown attached to them,"" he says. ""It saddens me that there are still so many people suffering here. I can't stand the thought that there may be people who died because they had no-one to talk to.""","Kyoko Ogawa became depressed after losing her hotel in March tsunami .

1349,"(CNN) -- The death toll from a shooting at a Nevada IHOP restaurant has risen to four, officials said early Wednesday morning. A gunman carrying a variant of an AK-47 rifle opened fire on uniformed Nevada National Guard members as they were having breakfast at the Carson City restaurant Tuesday morning. In all, 11 people were shot. Of them, one civilian was killed as were two National Guard members. Another National Guard member, who was taken to a hospital and underwent surgery, later died -- bringing the toll to four, said Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong. The attacker also died of a self-inflicted wound after the shooting. The suspected gunman was identified as Eduardo Sencion, 32, who lived in Carson City and worked at a family business in South Lake Tahoe, California, authorities said. Authorities said they had not determined a clear motive. ""To say that he was targeting before he came into the restaurant those military persons, we have not been able to establish,"" Furlong said. ""Clearly, the fact that five of the 11 were military draws a concern by us."" Sencion had no previous criminal record on file but his family indicated he may have had mental health issues, Furlong told reporters. The shooting began shortly before 9 a.m. When authorities arrived, those who called in the incident identified the shooting suspect as a man lying wounded in the parking lot between two vehicles. The suspect had continued firing in the parking lot after leaving the restaurant, Furlong said. The AK-47 was recovered as well as an empty 30-round gun magazine and two other gun magazines. A pistol and assault rifle were found in or near a vehicle, the sheriff said. Steven Martin, a witness, told CNN Reno affiliate KRNV that he ran to see if he could help after he heard the shots. ""There was blood everywhere; broken glass everywhere. It was just a war zone down there,"" he said. The shooting took place just a few miles from the Nevada National Guard state headquarters in Carson City.","In all, 11 people are shot .

1350,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The estranged husband of ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" cast member Taylor Armstrong apparently killed himself in his home, according to police and the Los Angeles county coroner's office. Russell Armstrong's lawyer said he's ""100% convinced"" Armstrong's role in the reality show created his depression, but he does not blame the Bravo network for his death. Investigators did not find a suicide note near the body of Armstrong, 47, who was pronounced dead at 8:16 p.m. Monday, Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said Tuesday. His body was found in a Mulholland Drive home in the hills above Bel Air, California, Winter said. ""It does appear to be a suicide by hanging,"" Los Angeles Police spokesman Richard French said. Armstrong was the subject of numerous celebrity gossip website stories in recent weeks that detailed allegations of abuse made against him in his pending divorce. After Taylor Armstrong filed for divorce last month she told People magazine that she was verbally and physically abused during their nearly six-year marriage. ""I felt like I was dying inside,"" she told People. ""Now, there's some sense of peace."" In his interview with People, Russell Armstrong said, ""Maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were. This show has literally pushed us to the limit."" Ronald Richards, who was Russell Armstrong's lawyer, said in an interview Tuesday with A.J. Hammer, host of HLN's ""Showbiz Tonight,"" that the response to the divorce filing was sitting on his desk and had been about to be filed in court. ""He did not want the divorce at all, but he was willing to accept her decision,"" Richards said. ""He tried to fix some of her concerns, but as I've advised many couples in this area, including Mr. Armstrong, these shows have a way of tearing apart a marriage when one spouse takes a certain directions and the other spouse is left kind of supporting the financial part of the marriage."" Armstrong, who was defending himself against a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, was financially drained, Richards said. His credit cards had been suspended, adding to the pressure, he said. But his downfall was caused by his role in the reality show, he said. ""I'm 100% convinced and based on facts that this show led to his depression on a couple different grounds,"" Richards said. ""One is that the show characterized him as someone that abused his spouse. It highlighted ancient financial negatives in his past and put him in a spotlight that he wasn't equipped to deal with."" His lawyer said the allegations of verbal and physical abuse stemmed from ""drunk arguments."" ""That's what they were dealing with here,"" he said. ""There may have been the normal type of kind of shoving that drunk people sometimes get into."" A combination of factors stemming from the show were ""wearing on him,"" his lawyer said. ""There's the appearance that she's moving forward as a celebrity,"" Richards said. ""He's now a divorce male with kids and he still has a tremendous debt service that he was handling for both of them that was supporting their lifestyle."" The sudden celebrity that followed the Armstrong's appearance on ""Real Housewives"" was overwhelming to the couple, he said. ""When that sort of stardom attacks a marriage sort of overnight, like in the case of a reality TV star, it's not like an actor that progressively moves up the ladder and the couple deals with this in stages,"" he said. ""A reality show takes an average person that has no stardom and throws them into a public spotlight literally within a couple of episodes, and a lot of couples are not prepared for that and this is a very unfortunate consequence."" Still, Richards said he does not blame the network for his client's depression and death. ""A network cannot be held accountable to people's voluntarily opening of their doors of their private lives. The adults that allowed this to happen to them are responsible,"" the attorney said. ""The network is justified in making good television out of their conflict."" Armstrong's death should serve as a warning to the dangers people face when they sign up for a reality show, he said. ""Adults need to go into these things with your eyes wide open, (realizing) that if you're going to have a network cover your private life, you become a public figure, people can comment about you and there's a high degree of probability that your marriage will end up in shambles as a result of this newfound scrutiny by the public and by the TV network that is covering our private lives,"" Richards said. The network that carries the show issued a short statement Tuesday morning: . ""All of us at Bravo are deeply saddened by this tragic news. Our sympathy and thoughts are with the Armstrong family at this difficult time.""

1351,"Bastrop, Texas (CNN) -- An elite search team joined local officials Wednesday in Bastrop County, Texas, to help look for people who may be trapped in a huge wildfire that has destroyed hundreds of homes. The cause of the Bastrop County fire, one of many burning in Texas, remains under investigation. County Judge Ronnie McDonald said during an afternoon news conference Wednesday that 576 homes had been destroyed in the county and ""that number will increase."" In Leander, Texas, about 60 miles northwest of Bastrop, authorities said a smaller fire this week was believed to be the result of arson. Investigators were searching for four teen suspects -- two boys and two girls, all believed to be 15 to 16 years old -- who were spotted running from the wooded area prior to and during the fire on Monday, the Leander Police Department said. That fire destroyed 11 homes in the Mason Creek North subdivision.  Authorities estimate the damage at $1.4 million, said Connie Watson, spokeswoman for Williamson County. For nearly 300 days, wildfires have been taking a toll on drought-stricken Texas, scorching communities and creating dangerous conditions. A new wildfire broke out in the western part of Camp Bullis, north of San Antonio, Wednesday afternoon, but authorities say it is already half-contained.  At least 125 acres have been burned in the area and 100 homes within a quarter-mile radius have been evacuated, according to Bexar County Fire Marshall Public Information Officer Laura Jesse.   Officials have called in air support to drop water and fire retardant and there is a strike team ahead of the blaze creating fire breaks, Jesse said. An air quality alert was in place Wednesday for San Antonio, Austin, Victoria, Houston and Galveston, said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. While winds were relatively calm, humidity was low, expected to be in the ""very dry 10% to 20% range this afternoon,"" said HLN meteorologist Bob Van Dillen. ""That's the real danger today."" Of biggest concern is the Bastrop County Complex fire, which has killed at least two people.  It was 30% contained Wednesday. Authorities were hoping to having the blaze contained by the end of the day Wednesday, said Mike Fischer, the county's emergency management coordinator.  ""We can say we're comfortable the fire won't get any larger,"" he said. The fire, near Austin, began Sunday and has spread across 33,000 acres, forcing the evacuations of at least 5,000 people, officials said. ""Last night was the first night we've had (since the blaze started) with no structures destroyed,"" McDonald said at the afternoon news conference. He identified one of the Bastrop County victims as 48-year-old Michael Troy Farr, a worker in the city of Austin's electrical department. Farr's body was found at his residence, McDonald said. The identity of the second victim was not released. Authorities called on residents to take evacuation orders seriously. ""I cannot emphasize enough to Texans in the impacted areas the importance of heeding all warnings from local officials, especially evacuation orders, as these fires are mean, swift and highly dangerous,"" Gov. Rick Perry said. The 600-member Texas Task Force 1 will assist local officials and first responders, Perry said. A leadership team from the task force arrived Tuesday. ""Based on the needs of local officials, a wide area search team consisting of approximately 100 members and nearly one dozen search canines will be in Bastrop Wednesday morning to work with the local incident management team and assist with search operations,"" Perry's office said in a statement. The announcement did not say that anyone was missing, but said Perry made the decision to send in the team after being ""briefed on the potential loss of life."" A White House statement Wednesday said Perry got a call from President Barack Obama to ""express his concern for citizens of Texas impacted by the unprecedented fires."" The president assured the governor ""that requests for additional assistance, including as recovery begins, would be quickly assessed,"" the statement said. At the local convention center in Bastrop, evacuees were stopping by to pick up supplies and water. ""It's shocking, mostly, not knowing what the end result is going to be,"" Bill Ludwig said. Linda Arebalos said that while her house can be replaced, ""all the memories is what really hurts, hits the heart."" She said she thought about the baby pictures, the things her children made in elementary school, ""the things I put up to save to give to their kids. And it's gone. It hurts."" Jerry Hooten found little more than ashes when he returned to his home and the burned-out shells of cars he had to leave behind. ""We ain't happy about it, but we're all alive,"" said Hooten, who is staying at an RV park outside the danger zone. ""I don't think it's registered in our brains that our house is gone and that, really, half of Bastrop is gone,"" said evacuee Claire Johnson. The two people killed by the blaze were not public safety personnel, according to incident command officials, who declined to offer details. The deaths raise the overall toll from the outbreak of fires to four lives lost. A wildfire killed a woman and her 18-month-old child Sunday when flames engulfed their home near Gladewater, officials said. The Union Chapel fire, 18 miles from the Bastrop fire, appeared to be under control Wednesday, Fischer said. The danger from a fire near Houston -- called the Magnolia fire -- appeared to be lessening for the most populated areas. Officials in Harris County, which includes Houston, said the fire was no longer a threat there. Also, many residents were allowed back into their homes Tuesday in neighboring Montgomery County. About 4,000 homes in Montgomery had been evacuated, according to Lt. Dan Norris of the county's emergency management office. Firefighters continued to battle hot spots in Montgomery, but the bulk of the problems from the Magnolia fire appeared to be centered in Waller and Grimes counties, Norris said. So far in 2011, 7.2 million acres of grass, scrub and forest have burned in wildfires nationwide. Of those, some 3.5 million acres -- nearly half -- have been in Texas, according to Inciweb, a fire-tracking website maintained by state and federal agencies. More than 2,000 firefighters are working fires across the state, said Tom Boggus, director of the Texas Forest Service. The drought in Texas has cost the state an estimated $5 billion this year in loss of crops and livestock, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. ""Now fires are adding to that number.""

1352,"(CNN) -- Dozens of 911 calls released Wednesday by the Carson City, Nevada, Sheriff's Office capture the horror of a mass shooting at an IHOP restaurant. In one call, a woman sobs as she tries to give the location of the shooter who fatally shot four others before he killed himself in the parking lot. Others seemed to be left almost speechless by the trauma as they give descriptions and accounts. ""Hurry send ambulances,"" one woman pleads. ""There are people dead."" A total of 11 people were shot Tuesday, Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong said. They included five uniformed Army National Guard members and six civilians. Three Guard members, a civilian woman and suspect Eduardo Sencion, 32, were killed. Authorities were investigating the motive Wednesday. Family members told authorities that Sencion had a history of mental problems dating back to age 16, a law enforcement official said. Sencion was carrying an assault rifle and a pistol when he went into the IHOP Tuesday morning, Furlong said. Ralph Swagler, owner of the nearby Locals Barbecue, told 911 that the shooter, who wore a red shirt and black pants, was carrying automatic weapons. ""Now he is coming back outside with a gun,"" Swagler said. ""He is shooting people in the parking lot!"" At that point, the businessman yells for his son to get out of the way. A burst of gunfire is then heard outside the IHOP. ""He is shooting at us now,"" said Swagler, who declined to speak Wednesday with CNN about the incident. ""Automatic weapons. He is shooting at everybody."" A second assault rifle was found in Sencion's vehicle, according to authorities. Only the assault rifle he carried was fired, the sheriff said. An IHOP customer talked with 911 operators as he looked inside the restaurant's window after the rampage. ""Oh my God, we've got (expletive) people down."" Sencion, who had no prior criminal history, continued firing in the restaurant's parking lot after shooting the IHOP patrons. Four nearby businesses were hit by gunfire, Furlong said. Emergency operators remained poised during the barrage of 911 calls. ""We've got help on the way,"" they assured eyewitnesses. ""It was crazy,"" said one witness calling from IHOP. ""It was like a nightmare."" Furlong said he was the second person to arrive on the scene Tuesday morning. He held a woman shot in the head. ""The scene was horrific. It's something that I've never experienced before,"" the sheriff said. ""It looked like a bloodbath, wall-to-wall carnage."" Investigators are trying to determine whether Sencion obtained the AK-47 used in the shooting lawfully. The released calls include conversations between law enforcement personnel, who are told they need to be on the lookout for possible additional shooters. Sencion acted alone, authorities learned. In one call, an officer is asked if more assistance is needed. ""At this point we have the scene under control,"" was the reply. CNN's Thelma Gutierrez contributed to this report.","911 callers describe chaotic scene inside, outside Carson City IHOP .

1353,"Tokyo (CNN) -- The words ""Ganbaro Nippon"" -- ""Be strong, Japan"" -- shine down on the nation's capital nightly from the soaring steel of the landmark Tokyo Tower. But a society known worldwide for its culture of stoicism has been knocked a bit off balance by the one-two punch of a massive earthquake and a nuclear disaster, according to both ordinary residents and experts. Andrew Grimes, a clinical psychologist working in Japan, said the events and their literal and figurative aftershocks have had ""a severe effect on people's sense of security."" ""It's uncharted territory to some extent,"" Grimes said. ""But I think the mental health aspect is already with us, and it's going to stay with us for a while."" And Junichi Onodera, the director of a badly damaged hospital in northern Japan, said the disaster's psychological scars will linger longer than the current crises. Onodera runs the Iwate Prefectural Hospital in Yamada, a town in the bulls-eye for the tsunami that followed the March 11 earthquake. Seaweed still drapes cabinets on the first floor of the facility, and X-ray machines, beds and wheelchairs too badly damaged to salvage line the parking lot. Exhausted doctors and nurses whose homes have been destroyed sleep alongside patients, many of whom arrive suffering from what Onodera likens to post-traumatic stress disorder. ""But what can we do?"" he asked. ""There are no psychologists here to help with that."" The quake killed more than 13,000 people in the region. Another 15,000-plus are still missing, and Japanese troops are still combing the ruins of coastal villages in search of bodies. The island nation has long been plagued by earthquakes. But last month's magnitude 9 quake has generated strong aftershocks for more than a month, with more than eight deaths blamed on fresh tremors in the past week. ""The degree of fear of earthquakes has risen up these days,"" Tokyo businessman Ryuji Kita told CNN. Kita said the repeated aftershocks have put his entire family on edge, and he gets e-mails from friends and relatives in western Japan after each temblor. In Tokyo, more than 300 km (190 miles) south of the quake's worst impact, the disaster was followed by a brief period of rolling blackouts and an extended campaign of power conservation. Outside a nightclub around the corner from the Kantei, the prime minister's office, a sign advises passerby, ""Save power and carry on"" -- an echo of iconic British posters from World War II. Many subway stations have been half-lit, and when baseball returned after delaying the start of its season for three weeks, many games played in the Tokyo Electric Power Company's service area were moved to afternoons. Tokyo Electric faces a 20% capacity shortfall since the quake knocked out two of its nuclear power plants. One of those is Fukushima Daiichi, the center of a slow-motion crisis that Japan declared a top-scale nuclear accident Tuesday. Yoshi Domoto, executive director of the Atlanta-based Japan-America Society of Georgia, said the Japanese have been sticking together, as they have through a long history of disasters. ""They're more group-oriented than Americans, so that's helping them out,"" Domoto said. That sense of community leaves people less isolated than they would be otherwise, said Professor Lonny Carlile of the Center for Japanese Studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Neighborhoods tend to come together, accounting for residents, handing out circulars, or holding regular cleanups. After the tsunami, local governments quickly designated which towns would take in survivors from other towns that were hit, Carlile said. ""You have what in essence is a routine (that will) kick in during an emergency,"" Carlile said. And in the United States, expatriates are raising money for disaster relief. The Japanese community in Los Angeles is so large that Japanese prefectures have their own local organizations, said Gwen Muranaka, English editor of the Rafu Shimpo, a daily Japanese-American newspaper there. ""I think there's a real commitment,"" she said. ""This isn't going to go away in a month. People feel that they're committed to helping."" But in the shadow of Fukushima Daiichi, fears about possible contamination of the basics of life --- food and water -- have fueled an ""enormous inability to calm down,"" said Grimes, the director of Tokyo Counseling Services. And many people in Tokyo who depend on trains to get around ""are very concerned and afraid of being stuck again, like we all were on that first Friday."" Grimes said psychiatrists and psychologists expect to see an increased number of patients suffering from depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, nightmares and problems with appetite in the coming months. ""We've had many more people first-time people coming in, including couples,"" he said. As the nuclear crisis drags on, both the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric have faced increasing criticism of their early response and the utility's inability to offer an estimate of when it might be resolved. Prime Minister Naoto Kan's ruling Democratic Party of Japan took a beating in the first round of local elections Sunday, losses he said Tuesday were ""very difficult for our party."" And with the crisis also pinching Japan's economy, Kan urged citizens to ease up on some self-imposed austerity measures. ""While keeping sympathy with the disaster victims, shall we try not to apply too much self restraint and go back to daily life?"" he asked. ""Consuming products from the disaster-hit area is one way of supporting the victims."" The Japanese government has begun easing restrictions on produce from the stricken region as radiation readings go down. Vendors selling vegetables and fruit from Fukushima Prefecture were doing a land-office business outside Tokyo's packed Shimbashi subway station at Wednesday's rush hour, with some stands selling out in minutes, their operators announced. A woman named Shiho, who would not give her last name, told CNN she was more worried about continued earthquakes than radiation. She said she was worried about how to evacuate with her two cats, since pets weren't allowed in shelters, and had stockpiled food and water for an emergency kit in case of another major quake. ""The government is confused about what they should do,"" she said. ""We need a clear scenario to recover. If we Japanese people could have a clear vision about how to recover, then the recovery would be more effective.""

1354,"(CNN) -- A power outage Thursday left more than 1.5 million people in the dark in parts of Southern California, Arizona and Mexico as authorities scrambled to figure out what happened and how to get the lights back on. Authorities said the outage occurred after a high-voltage power line between Arizona and California was tripped out of service, according to a statement released by San Diego Gas & Electric. It was not known what caused the service to be shut off, though authorities said it was not an act of terrorism. Power began to be restored by late evening Thursday, though officials warned it would take until Friday to completely restore power in portions of San Diego and Orange counties. ""Again, it's a slow process. It's going to take a long time to bring the power,"" San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders told reporters. The mayor warned residents in one California's most populous counties to stay off the road and limit cellular phone service, and school was cancelled Friday for thousands of students. San Diego Gas & Electric said all of its 1.4 million customers were without power. The power line break ""caused our line from AZ and from the north of our region to both trip off,"" the utility posted on its Twitter account. ""Think of the system as linked by springs, when one part goes out the rest are affected,"" another Twitter post from the utility said. Power outages in California stretched Thursday from San Clemente in Orange County to the state's border with Mexico, a San Diego County spokesman told CNN. In Arizona, about 56,000 customers in Yuma lost power, Arizona Power and Supply said. Parts of Mexico's Baja California and Sonora states were also without power, Mexican authorities said. The power outage posed no threat to the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station near San Clemente, California, authorities said. At the nuclear power plant, units ""tripped from grid disturbance"" but have offsite power and were in normal shutdown mode, said Eliot Brenner, director of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Office of Public Affairs. The Civil Protection Department in Baja California said authorities there were working to fix a problem at a hydroelectric plant. San Diego County activated its emergency operations center as officials tried to learn more about the blackout, county spokesman Michael Workman said. Linzi Berkowitz in Carlsbad, California, said the widespread power outage wreaked havoc during rush hour. ""The whole city is a mess and hopefully it doesn't get worse,"" she told CNN iReport. Power went out about 3:45 p.m. in San Diego, said Joe Pettigrew, who said he was trapped on the 10th floor of an office building. ""We don't have air conditioning and the windows don't open,"" he said, noting that it was about 80 degrees outside. Rebecca Bloomfield of the San Diego airport authority said the airport was letting only inbound flights land. Outbound flights and security screening were halted due to the power outage.

1355,"West Pittston, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The swollen Susquehanna River began receding in northern Pennsylvania on Friday as authorities there and in other eastern U.S. states hit by the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee surveyed the damage. The Susquehanna appeared to crest at 42.66 feet at Wilkes-Barre, said Charles Ross with the National Weather Service in State College, Pennsylvania. Earlier, officials had said the river crested there at 38.83 feet, but that estimate was based on a faulty flood gauge, said Ross. ""Unofficially, it appears to be a crest of record,"" he said, surpassing the previous high set by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Flood stage there is 22 feet, according to the National Weather Service. While the flood-engorged Susquehanna crested in some Pennsylvanian and New York cities, other communities braced for still-higher water levels. The tropical moisture brought floodwaters that have left at least four people dead, caused widespread damage, and prompted police and the National Guard to patrol neighborhoods in an effort to ward off looters. On Thursday, President Barack Obama signed emergency declarations for Pennsylvania and neighboring New York, making federal resources available to respond to the flooding and its aftermath. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo surveyed some of the hardest-hit areas of his state Friday. ""There's no doubt that there is significant damage,"" he said. ""My guess is that there will be thousands of homes that will have sustained damage when all is said and done -- hundreds of businesses."" Cuomo said officials were moving from emergency operations into an assessment phase, but warned residents to remain vigilant. ""Stay off the roads. It's not yet time to go home. The water hasn't receded,"" he said. In Luzerne County, in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania, between 65,000 and 70,000 people were ordered to leave their homes as the Susquehanna rose above flood stage, according to Emergency Management Coordinator Stephen Bekanich. The valley has a levee system that tops out at 41 feet, said Drew McLaughlin, a spokesman for the Wilkes-Barre mayor's office. McLaughlin and other officials were examining the levees. ""We're closely monitoring, and it seems they are holding steady,"" he said. ""It's pretty much a ghost town,"" McLaughlin said from south downtown, adding that residents appeared to heed the call to leave. Other Luzerne County communities not protected by the system were not so fortunate. Heavy flooding was reported in West Pittston, Harding and Plymouth Township. ""At this point, we haven't been able to assess that (flooding and damage) because the water is so high,"" Bekanich said. Plymouth Township resident Francis Federici was forced to leave his home, which sat in five feet of floodwaters. ""On a normal day, we love it here,"" he said. ""There's nobody around us. We have a beautiful yard. We were fixing our home up."" Luzerne County Commissioner Maryanne Petrilla told CNN that ""potentially thousands of homes"" have been affected. Shelter space for 4,100 was rapidly being filled, and the county was looking for more space, she said. The area from Ithaca to Syracuse to Utica, in New York, and from Wilkes-Barre, to Scranton, to Monticello, in Pennsylvania, continued to experience major to record flooding, said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. An 8-year-old boy died Thursday in East Cocalico Township, Pennsylvania, after he was caught in a storm-water drain, said Cpl. Melissa Arment with the East Cocalico Township police. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead, she said. A 71-year-old man died Wednesday night in Derry Township, Pennsylvania, as he was bailing water out of the basement of his home and the walls of the structure caved in, said Chief Patrick O'Rourke of Derry Township Police. A third person drowned early Thursday near Brickerville in Lancaster County, CNN affiliate WGAL-TV reported. And a fourth person died about 4:30 a.m. Thursday in North Lebanon Township, Pennsylvania, police said. A motorist became stranded in high water and was outside the vehicle when struck by another vehicle, which then left the scene. The suspect and that vehicle were found, authorities said. Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, had received an incredible 15.37 inches of rainfall associated with Lee.  At least six other communities had rainfall totals exceeding 10 inches. Many in the area recalled the flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. That storm dumped as much as 18 inches of rain on the area in two days, destroying more than 68,000 homes and 3,000 businesses, and leaving 220,000 Pennsylvanians homeless. In Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, CNN iReporter Nick Bohacz said flooded roads prevented him from getting to work. Bohacz, who sent in several photos of the flooding, said he saw a line of people outside a hardware store waiting for supplies. The rising Susquehanna and Chenango rivers were also triggering evacuations in upstate New York, where evacuation orders were issued for portions of Binghamton and the towns of Conklin, Endicott, Johnson City, Union and Vestal, according to CNN affiliate YNN-TV. Numerous cities and counties declared a state of emergency. Video from Johnson City showed a flooded shopping mall and a football field with water nearly up to its goalposts. Water was coming over the flood walls in Binghamton, county spokeswoman Colleen Wagner said. About 15,000 people were ordered to evacuate, and about 1,400 were in shelters, she said. State officials sent in food and water. A number of boat rescues have taken place, she said, but she did not know how many. Broome County Emergency Services Director Brett Chellis urged people in the evacuation areas to leave and not return for now. Water was topping flood walls in Union and Vestal as well as Binghamton, he said. In Otego, New York, about 50 miles northeast of Binghamton, CNN iReporter Don Wyckoff captured footage of water cascading down a road. Wyckoff said he was stunned after watching neighbors and family members lose their homes to the floodwaters. ""You are seeing the tiny mill creek rip out culvert pipes and tearing away roads,"" he said. ""We never thought we would see this again. It happened in 2006, but it is worse now."" In Oneonta, on the Susquehanna upstream of Binghamton, Police Chief Gary O'Neill said some roads were washed out and parks flooded, but the water appeared to be receding. On the down side, water was flooding the chief's home in Binghamton. Mandatory evacuations were also in place for low-lying areas near Schenectady, New York, YNN said. In neighboring Montgomery County, authorities closed all roads and county buildings, saying only emergency vehicles would be allowed to travel. The New York State Thruway Authority opened and closed several roads and ramps. In Maryland, areas near Baltimore were also affected. High water blocked dozens of roads in Baltimore County, according to CNN affiliate WMAR-TV. The Prince George's County, Maryland, Fire and EMS Department said it was responding to numerous emergency calls, and nearly two dozen people had been rescued or helped by firefighters and the department's swift-water team. Additional rain is in store for much of the region the next couple of days, with up to an inch forecast through Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. The rain comes on top of the heavy precipitation that has fallen in the region from Hurricane Irene. What's left of Lee stalled across the central Appalachian Mountains and has since drifted into Indiana. CNN's Chandler Friedman, Ashley Hayes, Phil Gast, Sarah Dillingham, Ines Ferre, Mary Snow, Scott Thompson and Jesse Solomon contributed to this report.","NEW: At least four people have died in the flooding so far .

1356,"(CNN) -- The wife of a man killed by a shark during their honeymoon in the Seychelles islands paid tribute to him Wednesday, calling him a devoted husband and ""best friend."" Ian Redmond of Britain died after he was attacked by a shark Tuesday off Anse Lazio beach on the island of Praslin, authorities said. ""I loved him so much and he was a very special husband, a thoughtful son and a devoted brother. He worked tirelessly to give us both a wonderful married life and home and I want to thank him for nine years of joy,"" his wife, Gemma Redmond, said. ""We were having so much fun and we were so excited about our future together. Myself, our families and our friends are devastated and shocked by what has happened. The loss of Ian has left a gaping hole in our hearts that will never be filled. ""He was always calm and collected, strong and brave, witty and intelligent, handsome and caring, a remarkable individual who will be deeply and sorely missed. We are privileged and proud to have shared our lives with him,"" she added. The British high commissioner and a consular official have traveled to the island off the east coast of Africa, the U.K. Foreign Office said. ""Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time,"" the Foreign Office said. Authorities in the Seychelles, an Indian Ocean archipelago, have issued a temporary ban on entering the water in five areas following two fatal shark attacks this month -- the one on Redmond and another two weeks ago. French newspaper Le Figaro reported that a 36-year-old French man was badly bitten on the legs and died as he dived off the same beach in early August. An autopsy concluded he was the victim of a shark attack, the paper said.

1357,"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Russian officials say a terrorist explosion is the most likely cause of the derailment of an express train which killed at least 26 people and injured dozens more. The head of the Russian Railroads company  Vladimir Yakunin told state TV Saturday that investigators' ""main theory behind the accident is the blast of an unidentified explosive device conducted by unidentified persons -- simply speaking, a terrorist act."" State TV also quoted survivors who said they heard a blast moments before the train derailed. The Russian prosecutor's office is investigating whether the crash was caused by a terrorist attack, spokeswoman Marina Gridneva said. Police said they found a small crater beneath the tracks. But authorities were also looking into the possibility there was a technical fault on the track. Health Minister Tatyana Golikova said 96 people were injured, while the Russian prosecutor's office said 102 were hurt. Forty of the injured were in critical condition, Golikova said. Eighteen people were still listed as missing after the Friday night crash, said Sergei Shoigu, the Russian minister for emergency situations. A total of 681 people -- 20 of them employees -- were on the Nevsky Express as it traveled from Moscow to St. Petersburg on Friday night. The Nevsky Express is Russia's fastest train, equivalent to a bullet train. The crash happened at 9:25 p.m. (1825 GMT) when the train was 280 kilometers (174 miles) from St. Petersburg, Russian state radio said. At least three carriages carrying more than 130 people derailed and turned on their sides, and emergency workers were working to free anyone who may still be trapped inside. The crash happened 44 minutes after another high-speed train, the Sapsan, had successfully traveled from Moscow to St. Petersburg on the same rails, a representative of the Russian Transport Police said during a video conference call Saturday. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Shoigu of the emergency situations ministry also took part in the call. Shoigu said he would get more information as the derailed cars are lifted and authorities can see what is underneath. In August 2007, an explosion on the tracks derailed the Nevsky Express, injuring 60 people in what authorities called a terrorist act. Some 27,000 passengers on 60 trains were facing delays Saturday as a result of the accident, Russian State TV reported.

1358,"(CNN) -- The Tanzanian island of Zanzibar began three official days of mourning Sunday, a day after 200 people died when a ferry jammed with passengers and tons of cargo capsized amid strong waves. In addition to Tanzania, South Africa was sending divers and navy forces to help with recovery efforts, said Mohamed Aboud, the state minister of Zanzibar. British officials have also sent helicopters to help with the search efforts. ""Right now, we are focusing on getting the bodies for the relatives, but you never know, God is God ... we might find people alive,"" he said. Rescuers saved 579 people, including 20 children, Aboud said. ""A lot of children are going back to Zanzibar for school, so there were a lot on the ferry,"" said Ismail Katumba, a resident of Dar es Salaam. ""It was so chaotic. It was so crowded."" The minister said the ferry carries a maximum capacity of about 600 people and was traveling between the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. But additional passengers, who were apparently not registered, had also made their way onboard, he said. It capsized in predawn hours local time, sending passengers scrambling for any available objects to avoid getting swallowed by the dark waves, witnesses said. Some jumped atop mattresses floating from the cargo. Fisherman, local hotels and residents joined rescue crews to help in the search, authorities said. Rescue crews took bodies to a nearby tent. ""You could hear people screaming loud and crying as bodies surfaced, mostly children,"" said Katumba, who lost a friend in the accident. ""What you do is you just go over and start looking at the bodies to identify them."" Most of the rescued were transported to local hospitals for treatment, and some have been discharged. President Ali Mohamed Shein of Zanzibar, who ordered the three days of mourning, also called for flags to fly at half staff. Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete also said the nation would mark three days of mourning starting Sunday. The government has buried dozens of unidentified victims, the minister said, and will maintain records for those searching for loved ones. Pemba and Zanzibar, the two main islands on the Zanzibar archipelago, are popular among tourists for their pristine sandy beaches on the Indian Ocean. Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania.

1359,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Water with trace amounts of radioactivity may have leaked for months from a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine as it traveled around the Pacific to ports in Guam, Japan and Hawaii, Navy officials told CNN on Friday. The USS Houston arrives in Pearl Harbor for routine maintenance, during which the leak was found. The leak was found on the USS Houston, a Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine, after it went to Hawaii for routine maintenance last month, Navy officials said. Navy officials said the amount of radiation leaked into the water was virtually undetectable. But the Navy alerted the Japanese government because the submarine had been docked in Japan. The problem was discovered last month when a build-up of leaking water popped a covered valve and poured onto a sailor's leg while the submarine was in dry dock. An investigation found a valve was slowly dripping water from the sub's nuclear power plant. The water had not been in direct contact with the nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. Officials with knowledge of the incident could not quantify the amount of radiation leaked but insisted it was ""negligible"" and an ""extremely low level."" The total amount leaked while the sub was in port in Guam, Japan and Hawaii was less than a half of a microcurie (0.0000005 curies), or less than what is found in a 50-pound bag of lawn and garden fertilizer, the officials said. The sailor who was doused, a Houston crew member, tested negative for radiation from the water, according to Navy officials. Since March, the Houston had crisscrossed the western Pacific, spending a week in Japan and several weeks in both Guam and Hawaii, Navy officials said.  See a timeline of the sub's movements » . The Navy on Friday notified the Japanese government of the leak, the officials said, and told them it was possible the ship had been leaking while in port in Sasebo, Japan, in March. While Japan has agreed to allow U.S. nuclear-powered ships in Japanese ports, the decision was a not popular in Japan. The Houston incident comes at a time when the Navy is trying to smooth over a problem with a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The USS George Washington was due to replace the aging, conventionally powered USS Kitty Hawk this summer as the United States' sole carrier based in Japan. While en route to Japan this May, a massive fire broke out on the George Washington, causing $70 million in damage. The fire was blamed on crew members smoking near improperly stored flammable materials. There was no damage or threat to the nuclear reactor, but the ship was diverted to San Diego, California, for repairs. It now is expected to arrive in Japan at the end of September. The Navy this week fired the captain and his deputy, saying an investigation into the fire led to a lack of confidence in the leadership of both men. Just two weeks ago, thousands of Japanese protested the pending arrival of the George Washington.","Leak was found on the USS Houston during routine maintenance last month .

1361,"New York (CNN) -- Police will investigate the deaths of nearly 100 animals that were found in a Petco store after flooding in upstate New York, Johnson City Mayor Dennis Hannon said Monday. Employees at the Oakdale Plaza store checked on the premises late Wednesday and ""all was still well,"" Petco chief executive Jim Myers wrote Sunday on the chain's official blog, PetcoScoop. ""When the team members checked again early Thursday morning, the store was flooded with four feet of water and we were unable to enter,"" wrote Myers. A river flood warning was issued Wednesday afternoon for the entire Johnson City area, along with flash flood warnings that continued well into Thursday, according to Joanne Labounty, a spokeswoman for the National Weather Service. According to Hannon, a woman who identified herself as the manager of the store approached a firefighter who was near the Petco around 10:30 Thursday morning to request a boat. At that point, the store was under water, Hannon said, and there was not much the fire department could do. Once employees were able to re-enter the store, they were able to rescue a majority of the animals, Myers wrote. More than 100 small animals and three-quarters of the aquatic life were rescued, according to Lisa Epstein, a Petco spokeswoman. The small animals included an assortment of guinea pigs, mice, reptiles and birds. Hannon questioned how the animals could have survived, recalling that ""the floodwaters were very high, well above the front doors of the building. Unless the animals were very near the ceiling, a couple feet from it, they would have perished."" Hannon is upset that the store did not take more caution after he issued a state of emergency for Johnson City. ""The media was reporting that any area that was flooded in 2006 would be badly flooded again,"" Hannon told CNN, noting that the Oakdale Plaza was one of those areas. The Johnson City store is a relatively new location, Myers wrote in his blog, and it was not in operation during the record high-river floods of 2006, and ""we misjudged the risk to this location."" ""We apologize to the members of the Johnson City community and look forward to serving you better in the future,"" Myers wrote. Angry comments accompanied the blog post, with readers accusing the chain of making excuses. Several commenters said they had called PETA to report the incident. ""So many, so many residents are outraged over this, we owe it to the community to get to the bottom of it,"" Hannon said. Epstein said Petco is internally investigating the incident as well.","Flooding hit upstate New York last week .

1362,"(CNN) -- The uncle of a Utah motorcyclist pulled from underneath a burning car by a group of bystanders told his nephew's rescuers they are ""heroes to our family."" Tyler Riggs spoke to CNN's Piers Morgan one day after a group of construction workers, students and other bystanders turned into a ragtag team of first responders to save Brandon Wright, 21. The accident happened Monday on a street near Utah State University in Logan and was captured on video. ""I thank you on behalf of my family, and I know that my nephew Brandon will hope to thank you at some point, too. I know that you might be shy and want to dislodge the title, but you are heroes to our family,"" Riggs said, adding that his nephew is in good spirits. ""He was talking to us earlier and going through physical therapy and felt good after that. Things could have been much worse."" Sgt. Jason Olsen of the Logan police was the first officer on the scene. He was about to motion to a fellow responding officer to grab a jack when, ""I realized that these citizens had already organized and were just going to manually lift (the car) up."" The crash occurred when a BMW pulled out of a parking lot and in front of the motorcyclist. Jeff Curtis, assistant chief of Logan police, said the motorcyclist tried to avoid the car, which resulted in him laying the motorcycle down. After crashing, gas spilled out of the motorcycle and ignited, engulfing both the motorcycle and the front end of the car in flames, Curtis said. The motorcyclist became lodged underneath the burning vehicle. The video, shot by Chris Garff, shows several startled bystanders looking under the BMW as flames leap into the air. The crowd quickly grows to include a man in a suit, construction workers wearing hard hats, a woman in sandals and a young man carrying a backpack, the video shows. After one person in the group tries to pick up the blazing car, the crowd joins in and lifts the 4,000-pound vehicle. ""I do remember one gentleman saying, 'We need everybody to come and help lift,' and that's when everybody ran over,"" Olsen recalled. One of the bystanders drags the fallen motorcyclist from under the vehicle, the video shows. Wright was rushed to a hospital and was in stable condition after surgery Monday evening, Curtis said. The driver of the car was not seriously injured. The man Curtis believes to be the driver appears in the video dressed in a dark suit. He stood a little off to the side from the group and did not help lift the car, the video shows. After Wright is pulled from underneath the vehicle, the man in the suit walks over to look at the motorcyclist. ""He was in a shock,"" Curtis said about the driver, adding that any possible charges related to the traffic accident are pending. ""It was frightening,"" said Garff, who shot the scene from the ninth floor of a nearby building. ""You don't really see something like that and then when you do, it's inspiring. It gives us hope,"" he told HLN's ""Prime News."" Police are looking for the good Samaritans to recognize them at a city council meeting for their actions. Most have already been identified, Curtis said. Three of them, all Utah State University students, spoke to CNN Tuesday. Anvar Suyundikov said he tried not to think of the danger as he jumped in to help. ""At first, when I saw it was a fire, I didn't think about myself,"" said Suyundikov ""I thought about this poor guy underneath the car, and I thought the car was going to explode."" Another student, James Odei said, ""All that came to my mind was if it was my son or my kid brother or anybody that is known to me, the first thing I would have done was to help that person. So all I did was quickly rush and give a helping hand."" Abbass al-Sharif said he did not think he or the others who helped were heroes. ""We are just human beings trying to help another human being. It is like our human instinct,"" he said. But police believe the bystanders are heroes. ""Each of those people put their lives in danger as they do what they can to rescue Brandon,"" Curtis told ""Prime News."" The area where Wright crashed is highly trafficked, Olsen said. ""I think had this accident happened in a suburban area we wouldn't have gotten that kind of response -- we would have never had that kind of manpower,"" he said. Olsen added: ""It speaks volumes to what people will do in a tragic situation to help another person out."" CNN's Anna Rhett Miller and Brooke Baldwin contributed to this report.

1363,"(CNN) -- A fire truck escorted the funeral procession of Shannon Stone, the veteran firefighter and Texas Rangers fan whose death at a baseball game prompted a national outpouring of condolences. Stone was buried Monday in his hometown of Brownwood, Texas. The 39-year-old firefighter fell to his death Thursday while trying to catch a ball at a Rangers game. He is survived by his wife, Jenny, and his son, Cooper. In the second inning of the ill-fated game, star outfielder Josh Hamilton tossed a souvenir ball into the stands after a batter hit a foul ball. Stone stuck out his glove and reached for the ball, but lost his balance and flipped over the railing of the outfield seats. He fell about 20 feet and crashed head-first into an area near a scoreboard, suffering fatal injuries. Stone died of blunt-force trauma, according to the Tarrant County medical examiner. Ronnie Hargis was seated in the stands near Stone and tried unsuccessfully to save him. ""Your first instinct is to reach out and grab him,"" Hargis told CNN's Don Lemon. ""I tried to grab him. I couldn't catch him. He went down. As he went by me I tried to grab him again and I missed and ... it looked like he was in slow motion as he was going to the ground. There was nothing I could do but watch him fall."" His 6-year-old son witnessed the tragic accident. ""It's just the cruelest of reminders of just how fragile human life can be,"" said Joe Trahan, sports anchor at CNN affiliate WFAA. ""The mind-boggling thing about this is that everyone's intent was right."" Rangers president Nolan Ryan, a Hall of Fame pitcher, said earlier that the club would review the height of railings at the stadium, even though they currently exceed the city's code limits. Trahan told Lemon that club management is already working on making changes at their stadium. ""I've spoken to Rangers officials, and they tell me that there are meetings that have already taken place with city leaders, meetings with architects at the ballpark, contractors. They're trying to find a permanent solution, not a stop-gap one."" But fan-awareness also plays a crucial role at stadiums, according to Trahan. ""This is a stark and cruel reminder that (safety) is everyone's responsibility when you go to the ballpark,"" he said, adding that he was surprised that injuries didn't happen more often, especially ""down the first and third base lines ... those are rocket shots coming off those bats."" The Rangers held a moment of silence before Friday night's game against the Oakland A's. Members of both teams wore black ribbons. Flags at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington flew at half-staff all weekend. The team has set up an account accepting donations in Stone's honor with the Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation. Donated money has been earmarked to help the Stone family. The Rangers have donated an undisclosed sum, according to the team's website, and the A's donated $5,000.

1365,"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Work to recover bodies from the scene of a pipeline explosion in a densely populated Nairobi slum has ended, Kenya Red Cross said Tuesday. Red Cross officials said 82 bodies had been recovered. Police pegged the number at 76. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy. The blast Monday morning flattened homes, reduced some bodies to dust and forced a massive evacuation of the Sinai slum amid fears that big pools of leaked fuel could ignite, police and Kenya Red Cross officials said. The fire erupted around 10 a.m. local time, possibly as a group of people were siphoning fuel from the pipeline, which runs through the Lunga Lunga industrial area, officials said. Coming to a precise accounting of the toll may be difficult because so many of the victims were found huddled together and severely burned, Carol Nduta, a Kenya Red Cross emergency medical instructor and dispatcher who traveled to the scene, said Monday. Some of the bodies were burned to dust, she said. In addition to the dead, 118 people were hospitalized, police said. The precise cause of the incident is under investigation. Kenya Pipeline Co., the state-owned petroleum company that owns the pipeline, said in a statement Monday night that it had detected a spill from a bypass line in the Sinai community on Monday morning and immediately moved to shut it down. State-owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation quoted Prime Minister Raila Odinga as saying the incident occurred after a mechanism on the pipeline failed, allowing fuel to spill into a drainage ditch, where it then ignited. Police, however, said the incident may have occurred after someone punctured the pipeline in an effort to steal fuel. Fatalities from fuel leak accidents are common in Kenya. Scores of residents scramble to scoop up fuel whenever there is a leak or a tanker is involved in an accident. In 2009, more than 100 people died in a fire after an oil tanker overturned in Molo, in western Kenya. In that incident, someone trying to take some of the fuel lit a cigarette, starting the fire. A 2009 article in a Kenyan newspaper, The Daily Nation, discussed concerns of such a fire in the Sinai slum, where residents built shanties and even a church next to or even on top of the pipeline, according to the Daily Nation. ""I don't think there will ever be a fire, but you never know,"" the newspaper quoted one resident who it said had refused to move away from the pipeline despite eviction notices from the pipeline's owner.

1366,"Washington (CNN) -- BP, Transocean and Halliburton all share responsibility for the deadly explosion that resulted in the April 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, according to the final federal report on the matter released Wednesday. The three companies ""violated a number of federal offshore safety regulations,"" according to the report, which includes a series of recommendations for improving drilling safety. The report, issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, concludes that a key cause of the explosion was a faulty cement drilling barrier at the Macondo well site. ""The precise reasons for the failure of the production casing cement job are not known,"" the report states.  But the disaster was ""the result of poor risk management, last minute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling"" at the site. BP was ""ultimately responsible"" for operations at the site ""in a way that ensured the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment,"" the report concludes. But Transocean, the owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig, was also ""responsible for conducting safe operations and for protecting personnel onboard."" Meanwhile, Halliburton -- a BP contractor -- was ""responsible for conducting the cement job, and ... had certain responsibilities for monitoring the well,"" the report says. A spokesman for BP said the company agrees with report's conclusion. ""The Deepwater Horizon accident was the result of multiple causes, involving multiple parties, including Transocean and Halliburton,"" Scott Dean said.  ""BP (has) acknowledged its role in the accident and has taken concrete steps to further enhance safety. ... We continue to encourage other parties to acknowledge their roles in the accident and make changes to help prevent similar accidents in the future."" Lou Colasuonno, a Transocean spokesman, said the report ""confirms that the primary cause of the incident was the catastrophic failure of the cement in the Macondo well,"" but his company continues to take ""strong exception to (any) criticisms of the Horizon drill crew."" Halliburton continued to deny any responsibility for the tragedy. The report ""incorrectly attributes the operation decisions to Halliburton,"" said Zelma Branch, a Halliburton spokeswoman.  ""Every contributing cause where Halliburton is named, the operational responsibility lies solely with BP.  Halliburton remains confident that all the work we performed with respect to the Macondo well was completed in accordance with BP's specifications for its well construction plan and instructions."" The explosion on the rig led to more than 200 million gallons of oil being released into the Gulf.  Eleven people working on the rig died in the explosion, while 16 others were injured. Besides the oil, hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemical dispersant went into the water.  At the peak of the crisis, in June 2010, 37% of Gulf waters -- a total of 88,522 square miles -- were closed to fishing due to contamination. The U.S. government announced plans in August to hold its first oil and natural gas lease sale in the Gulf since the incident. The proposed sale, scheduled for mid-December in New Orleans, will include more than 20 million acres in the western Gulf, according a recent statement from the Department of the Interior.

The fire is now under control but firefighters are battling to stabilize the multi-deck ship, which is taking on water, with the use of pumps, Eldoen said. Everybody on board has now been accounted for and no one is believed missing, she added. The cruise ship was operating on a popular tourist route from Bergen, to the small town of Kirkenes in the country's far northeast when the fire broke out, forcing the vessel to stop at Alesund, CNN affiliate TV2 reported. Alesund, a town of some 40,000 people surrounded by fjords, is 226 kilometers (147 miles) north of Bergen. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Hurtigruten staff in Alesund are booking guests on to alternative vessels or making arrangements for them to travel home, the company said. The 400 foot-long Nordlys, built in 1994, has 475 berths for passengers and can carry 45 cars.

1368,"Bellevue, Washington (CNN) -- Just a year before turning 40, Judy Haley was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer that required an immediate mastectomy. The procedure and the treatments that followed left her fatigued, nauseated and in so much pain that she couldn't pick up her 1-year-old daughter or do simple household chores. She also struggled with depression because she needed constant child-care assistance. ""It's really hard to ask for help,"" Haley recalled. ""You want to be competent and independent. ... And then, all of a sudden, you have to acknowledge the fact that you can't take care of your daughter all by yourself."" Haley and her husband were both full-time students, so there were also financial concerns. The couple cashed in their retirement to deal with the crush of medical bills. ""I was really bottoming out emotionally,"" Haley said. That's when a friend recommended that she reach out to the Pink Daisy Project, a nonprofit that provides support to breast cancer patients under 45. Since 2008, the Pink Daisy Project has helped more than 150 women -- mostly in the form of house-cleaning assistance and gift cards for gas, groceries and restaurants. But according to Haley, it's so much more. ""It's hope,"" she said. ""Right when I would hit the (emotional) low, there was a gift card ... or the toilet was 'magically' clean. I can't overemphasize the value of that to somebody with cancer."" The founder of the Pink Daisy Project, Debbie Cantwell, can relate to Haley's plight. She was 41 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. ""I could not even wrap my head around it,"" Cantwell said. ""You're relatively healthy, and they tell you (that) you have a chance of dying. ... It just throws your world upside down."" Cantwell underwent surgery to remove both breasts and 20 lymph nodes. She received eight rounds of chemotherapy and 37 radiation treatments before undergoing breast reconstruction surgery. She blistered, bled, lost all her hair and continued to work full-time as a copywriter and the sole provider for her husband and two young children. Throughout her treatment, however, Cantwell was supported by family, friends and co-workers who pitched in to help her with her daily responsibilities. Co-workers donated vacation and sick leave. Friends brought over meals and took on child-care duties. Relatives helped with mounting costs. ""I just felt so grateful that all these people in my life were there for me and made it manageable,"" she said. ""Once I was through with treatment, I couldn't possibly pay everybody back. So I decided I was going to pay it forward."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . Through her ordeal, Cantwell met other young breast cancer patients who were struggling through their treatment but lacked the kind of support that she had. She found that many breast cancer foundations exist primarily to raise awareness and funding for research and treatment, not to offset the daily stress on patients' lives. ""I'm all for research; I hope my daughter never has to go through this,"" Cantwell said. ""But the Pink Daisy Project's biggest concern is helping the (young) women that can't wait for a cure. ... They're sick right now, and they need help today."" Cantwell fields grant requests through her website. The grants average $400 in value and are designed to cover a woman's basic needs for about one month, but Cantwell will customize the level and type of support based on need and available resources. The money comes from small fundraisers and personal donations. ""Right now, the Pink Daisy Project is helping women in these small ways,"" Cantwell said. ""But eventually, I want to be able to help in larger ways with real practical, tangible things like helping with bills ... helping with the rent, helping with medical payments. It's so hard to focus on healing when you've got $12,000 in medical bills."" The average age of women diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States is 61. But according to the Young Survival Coalition, there are more than 250,000 women living in the U.S. who were 40 or younger when diagnosed. ""I think it's harder when you're younger,"" Cantwell said, ""because you're a mom, or you're a college student, or you're working. You normally felt really good. And suddenly, you feel terrible all the time."" Cantwell said older women also tend to have a larger support system. ""Older women sometimes have grown children to help or a retired husband, or their friends don't work,"" she said. ""Plus, there's a lot of senior services and Medicaid and disability and Social Security that, younger women, we often just don't have."" In addition to providing young breast cancer patients with immediate assistance, the Pink Daisy Project has built an online community that connects them and offers emotional support during what can be a potentially isolating time. ""I feel like they're my sisters, and I just want to do whatever I can to help them,"" Cantwell said. ""I cry a lot. I always light a candle when I lose somebody I've helped. ... It's unbelievable and heart-wrenching, but it's just part of the job. ... ""I'll probably die of breast cancer someday. But I don't feel sorry for myself. I never have. I want to really make the most of the time I have by doing some good in the world. ... And if the spirit of helping each other were to continue, I'd feel my efforts meant something.""

1369,"(CNN) -- Olympic marathon gold medalist Samuel Wanjiru died early Monday from injuries sustained after jumping from the balcony of his Nyahururu home in central Kenya, a senior police official said. Wanjiru jumped from the second-floor of his home late Sunday after his wife caught him in the company of another woman, said Jasper Ompati, a police official in Nyahururu. Wanjiru's wife, Tereza Njeri, and another woman were taken to the police station to give statements but were not considered suspects, Ompati said. The death remains under investigation, he said. Njeri, who lives in Nairobi, returned home unexpectedly to find the two together, Ompati said. Wanjiru is believed to have jumped after his wife locked him inside a bedroom on the second floor, making it impossible for him to leave, he said. Wanjiru achieved worldwide fame when he became Kenya's first Olympic marathon champion at the Beijing Games in 2008. Kenyans were mourning the death of Wanjiru, who was considered a national hero. Hundreds were lining up to view his body at a Nyahururu funeral home. Athletics Kenya, the governing athletic body, said the country lost a great athlete. The association said it had pinned its hopes on Wanjiru to win another medal at the London Olympics in 2012. ""He's left a gap that will be hard to fill,"" said David Okeyo, the secretary-general of Athletics Kenya. The International Olympic Committee praised Wanjiru as an accomplished runner who will be remembered for winning his country's first Olympic gold medal in the marathon and setting a new Olympic record in the process. ""Our thoughts are with his family and friends,"" the IOC said in a written statement sent to CNN. At 21, Wanjiru was the youngest gold medal winner in the marathon at an Olympics since 1932. After his Beijing triumph, Wanjiru has set about dominating the marathon distance, claiming a number of victories in races. It helped him be crowned the men's champion in the 2009 and 2010 world marathon majors series. In recent years, Wanjiru has had a number of troubles. In December 2010, Wanjiru was charged with making death threats against his wife and illegally possessing an AK47 rifle. At the time, prosecutors alleged Wanjiru was drunk when he made the threats. Wanjiru pleaded innocent to the charges during a court appearance in his home town of Nyahururu. His wife later dropped the charges, though he still faced a weapons charge. Wanjiru was forced to withdraw from the London Marathon, a premier running event ahead of the 2012 Olympics, after he was involved in an automobile accident in January in Kenya.

1370,"(CNN) -- One by one, disasters have battered the Deep South in recent years: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, horrific tornado outbreaks, the Gulf oil spill and now a flood of biblical proportions on the Mississippi River. It's as if Old Testament punishments have befallen the bayous, deltas and savannahs of a region that's already scourged with staggering poverty. ""We're waiting for the locusts,"" commented Kim Fritz, interim executive director of the Mississippi Casino Operators Association. ""At a certain point, you have to go: 'What else?' "" Within her group alone, the economic punch of this month's expanding flood has put 10,000 hourly employees temporarily out of work at 16 shuttered casinos along the river, Fritz said. Open Story: Damage map . ""All kidding aside,"" she said, ""it's been pretty tough in this area over the past few years, but we just get up and keep going."" Up and down the magnificent Mississippi, tales of hardship -- and at least one case of good fortune -- are emerging as the river is rising. Flooding and other disasters are nothing new to the crawfishermen, casino workers, hotel housekeepers, barge skippers, watermen and other working-class individuals who make their living from the Mississippi and the Gulf. But so many problems coming so closely together are taking a toll. ""What can we do to catch a break?"" asked Wayne Mansfield, director of the Warren County Port Commission and the Warren County Economic Development Foundation, based in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Floodwaters on rise in Mississippi, Louisiana . The 600-acre facility, the nation's 11th-busiest inland port moving as many as 14 million tons of bulk material a year, is closed because of flooding, bringing business to a halt, he said. ""Vicksburg's and Warren County's economy has long been tied to the river, for 150 years or more,"" Mansfield said. ""Because of fuel prices ... we had seen an increase in barge activity, but the problem now is the barges have nowhere to dock because the docks are underwater."" It's not just riverbank commerce that has been paralyzed, Mansfield said. Inland flooding of roads has also forced many businesses to shut down, including 1,200 jobs at a paper mill and a manufacturer of shallow-water oil rigs, Mansfield said. ""You know, the one thing about Mississippi and Mississippians, we are truly a resilient people,"" Mansfield said. ""After the event is over, we will rely once again on the river for our recovery."" What does cresting mean? If there's a welcome surprise in the slow-moving disaster that's the great Mississippi River flood of 2011, it's that the crawfish are now running heavy, said craw fisherman Jody Meche, 41, of Henderson, Louisiana. Crawdads are so big in this part of the country that Louisiana accounts for 98% of the country's production, according to the Louisiana Crawfish Farmers Association. Meche has been exposed to crawfishing all his life, starting with his father. His dad was born on a house boat on a bay of the Atchafalaya Basin, home to the nation's largest river swamp and part of the Mississippi River watershed. The basin is among the most culturally rich and ecologically varied regions in the country, and it's home to the Cajun culture. With a thick accent steeped in the region, Meche considers himself a Cajun and speaks a little French though he can't keep up with the old timers, he said. Meche has been fishing for crawdads for 21 years, a skill he learned from his fisherman father, he said. For now, the flood has pushed so much water -- and oxygen -- down the river that crawfish are growing fast and eating well, Meche said. That translates to a good catch in his traps. But the rising waters have forced Meche to string the crawfish traps to higher tree branches, he said. So he has to motor his 19-foot skiff closer to the tall branches and stand atop the catwalk on his boat to tether the traps to the tall trees among the flooded banks, he said. It's worth the extra work, he said. He's now harvesting 50 to 60 sacks a day of crawfish, or 700 to 1,000 pounds, he said. ""The crawfish is going to run heavy, but it's a hectic situation,"" said Meche, who's also vice president of the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association West, which has 400 to 500 members. ""We have to cut a lot of the branches and the trees. You have to add strings to the cages, and with every day the water rises, you have to raise the strings higher in the tree."" If this pace continues, he can meet the typical annual income of $30,000 to $50,000, minus up to 35% in expenses such as bait, gas and motor parts, he said. ""You see, we're like farmers,"" Meche said. ""You got to make hay while the sun is shining."" The flood does pose one big threat to him and other craw fishermen. If the water breaches the levees and floods roads, markets will close and trucks won't be able to transport the bounty to consumers, he said. ""We're keeping our fingers crossed that it's going to stay within the levees,"" Meche said. ""And that's going to be a real big if."" How the Mississippi River levees could fail . The other peril facing the fishermen is old timber. Past hurricanes such as Gustav in 2008 felled many trees along the river, and the timber has since been lodged along the banks, said Stephen Minvielle, director of the Louisiana Crawfish Farmers Association. The flooding Mississippi will likely dislodge a lot of that wood, and ""it's going to act as 10,000-pound battering rams floating down the river,"" Minvielle said. Meche, a tough Cajun who skins farm alligators in the off-season, said he's prepared for all seasons, come what may. ""The craw fishermen, we're hard working people,"" Meche said. ""We're a resilient people. We're not lazy people, you know what I'm saying.""","The Deep South has been pummeled by big disasters caused by nature and man .
This month's flooding on the Mississippi River has rendered many residents jobless .
But, as one Cajun fisherman says, Southerners are ""a resilient people""",122 35 15 35 7907 19 5848 0 1245 330 4 346 75 15177 9600 3 12395 2400 10007 10645 0 3635 2099 8369 3 70 1 4507 5 13513 11767 8 0 5835 1859 13 7 16 63 336 8624 11864 19 46363 0 139415 100770 3 79788 5 1 968 11 7 251 168533 9 4121 3674 43 192 1096 6 0 46381 4829 3180 27407 5655 825 438 5 0 5835 7578 6205 1095 12 1 1011 326 78 19 2 130 64 809 390 87 216 857 0 1110 5397 5 24 201 7 5544 4507 20 168 166 125 19066 1798 4593 40 5 145 12 455 19308 17700 337 0 1859 27407 21 415 594 1005 2876 49 14004 2652 83 21 13 7 29 984 1216 4 24 314 56 0 255 218 75 18 43 58 94 39 3 311 128 39 3 71 0 6164 5835 7940 5 11050 3 12 296 35 229 5 164 3425 28 4062 16 0 1859 10 1876 4696 3 66 7907 28 424 68 2 0 522606 7578 980 1182 36106 16297 51293 138381 3 66 13772 1774 25 109 34 505 17 0 5835 3 0 3635 18 59 106 619 439 59 2229 349 28 252 1 3303 64 57 43 89 2 2037 1 778 224 3160 17054 438 5 0 4618 679 2974 1765 3 0 4618 679 1110 1164 1870 571 4 53546 5835 17324 8 1208 4 5835 5104 0 61846 2283 0 718 7 522605 12153 2974 906 16 106 16 463 298 5400 5 6980 2008 1 79 10 1250 82 5 4696 1569 491 2 1 4323 27 21 53546 7 3 4618 679 7 1382 20 188 29 2596 2 0 1859 6 1889 75 50 45 17054 21 82 5 2549 2242 43 32 175 23 1031 4 16297 1671 18 0 589 70 10 0 28418 19 3841 2 5415 82 0 15703 28 5952 13 7 26 58 26993 7098 11 20 29 10670 17054 21 12153 4696 5 2817 20 41 580 106 2141 2 2089 71 129 162 856 1354 12 1 1497 10636 3 1 5614 5 111480 2099 23762 17054 21 78 143 0 35 368 44 5835 3 66136 43 28 2074 1 10908 62 17054 21 31 0 678 10 56 43 42 4141 267 248 8 0 1859 6 110 1756 64 291 57031 902 63 48 7 1 1838 1536 4 0 24823 2422 11 7 0 265 5835 1859 4507 5 376 13 7 11 0 61332 28 70 647 1278 21 73503 10566 24790 181855 2027 5 8021 5104 522604 28 59 269 4 24 144 5 0 177 11 5104 1960 6 6640 5 0 177 7 2030 120 2 0 5104 61332 5382 1095 181855 20 29 2395 2 522603 49 33 142 1077 9 33 366 33 1966 14 869 8 1 222 2602 8 1 2275 5 0 65967 13127 102 2 0 718 7 1080 1859 19896 3 144 5 0 5835 1859 16288 0 13127 10 285 0 96 15427 2186 3 35799 8580 3747 4 0 177 3 13 7 102 2 0 41278 1493 9 1 3702 8563 19050 4 0 968 181855 6121 377 1 41278 3 2929 1 231 1115 315 27 57 47 311 39 9 0 336 45043 27 21 181855 20 29 4393 6 522604 6 698 75 1 5775 27 1336 17 33 10566 366 27 21 6 70 0 4507 20 1796 59 133 622 3 5233 71 0 1859 11 61332 28 849 1414 3 1869 124 181855 21 11 9987 2 1 164 2037 4 33 13649 18 0 1876 2926 19 580 181855 2 2644 0 61332 13649 2 1127 2795 6633 27 21 59 27 20 2 4397 33 92981 48649 1893 2 0 3055 6633 3 784 7519 0 9418 8 33 2602 2 27573 0 13649 2 0 3055 3088 285 0 5060 2996 27 21 13 7 853 0 1302 145 27 21 27 7 70 17358 464 2 904 18153 1 108 5 61332 50 2633 2 162 125 1676 27 21 0 61332 10 128 2 383 1278 18 13 7 1 13679 662 21 181855 25 7 41 1879 263 5 0 5104 61332 4917 1095 403 38 20 1597 2 739 319 43 19 2 699 1 276 5 0 6633 3 0 3088 78 19 2 1634 12552 2 0 15655 3 9 195 108 0 622 4573 78 19 2 1196 0 12552 1127 4 0 2795 63 24 2921 1084 27 57 782 0 3062 1409 2539 5 286 125 2 464 125 9268 39 2 1104 4 5025 132 16 16105 1847 3 4397 1001 27 21 78 127 43 192 84 5382 181855 21 78 178 2 109 12278 77 0 1514 10 8481 0 4507 291 2516 35 269 1097 2 85 3 66 73503 10482 63 0 622 9187 0 28170 3 7137 2817 3430 42 320 3 5389 282 47 22 260 2 2354 0 13338 2 2970 27 21 43 192 1307 110 4464 3424 11 13 7 128 2 625 390 0 28170 181855 21 3 11 7 128 2 22 1 386 269 63 97 0 5835 1859 28170 72 3366 0 66 15827 1191 0 10482 10 336 13982 255 15177 132 16 31132 4 728 20305 106 3088 337 0 1859 3 0 13982 20 105 29 7366 337 0 2996 21 2341 522602 438 5 0 5104 61332 5382 1095 0 4696 5835 42 419 25066 1 276 5 11 3189 3 13 7 128 2 645 16 166 31696 15153 19430 5407 71 0 1859 522602 21 181855 1 1216 41278 25 19324 3124 28962 4 0 21944 21 27 7 1412 6 49 3525 160 64 111 0 73503 10482 43 192 393 277 62 181855 21 43 192 1 10908 62 43 192 26 9609 62 78 143 64 46 171 223,ad6d19e274e5d5df04d7cd1ab58e32169b6e7fe2,
1371,"Reno, Nevada (CNN) -- A man who once appeared discreetly as a stunt pilot in movies became the center of national attention after a crash at a Nevada air show. Jimmy Leeward is presumed dead after the Friday crash. The 74-year-old owned Leeward Ranch, a pilot community in Ocala, Florida. The 500-acre gated community features plane enthusiasts who build custom homes on lots that include hangars. The community has a runway so that people can fly from their homes. ""The vision was to have a variety of great airplanes, a variety of great pilots,"" Leeward said in a documentary about his ranch. ""And a place where everybody could really have a lot of fun. I wanted that as part of my vision to be something that was just like my father had in the 1930s."" Leeward started building the community in the 1980s with his sons and it has grown to more than 170 homes. Some residents left condolences on Leeward's Facebook page. His family also left a message on the page. ""Dear friends, we are deeply saddened by the tragedy at the air race today. Please join us in praying at this time for all the families affected,"" the message said. Leeward, was flying a P-51 Mustang in a Reno air race Friday, when he lost control and crashed. Some witnesses are crediting him with using his flying skills to help limit the number of people injured. 'I was ... preparing to die,' witness at Nevada air race crash says . ""I think he was trying to do whatever he could right up to the end,"" said Fred Scholz, a witness. ""I could hear the engine ... I thought he was coming in on top of us. Instead, he missed us by about 100 feet and went out into the box area in front of us."" Leeward, a son of a pilot, said that he was raised in airports. He worked as a stunt pilot in several films, including ""Amelia"" and ""The Tuskegee Airmen."" He had been part of the Reno air race since 1975, said Mike Houghton, president of the Reno Air Racing Association. ""He was very active in aviation.

1372,"(CNN) -- It's truly the dog days of summer in the South. The heat wave that has encompassed many Southern states this week is not expected to loosen its grip in the coming days. Scorching high temperatures are in the forecast over the weekend in the North. Topeka, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Omaha, Nebraska; and Oklahoma City are several cities under an excessive heat watch Friday through Sunday. And little relief is expected next week. An area of high pressure is anticipated to circulate hot and humid air over much of the central and eastern part of the country, the National Weather Service said in a statement Thursday night. ""Heat index values in excess of 110 degrees are likely,"" it said. Extreme heat indices -- how the air feels, with heat and humidity -- are expected to reach up to 116 degrees in Minneapolis next week. ""These are extreme out-of-the-ordinary temperatures for Minnesota,"" CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington and other areas in Texas experienced afternoon heat indices of 105 degrees or more through Thursday. The month of June was the hottest recorded for Texas since 1895, according to the National Weather Service. Lawton, Oklahoma, and Wichita Falls, Texas, shot past the 100 mark for the area's 16th consecutive day of triple-digit heat Thursday. In Oklahoma City, forecasters are calling for nearly another full week of temperatures near or above 100 degrees, threatening to break a 1936 record for 22 consecutive days of such heat. The heat has driven up the demand for water and shrunk soil, resulting in low water pressure and burst pipes in Oklahoma City. Officials issued mandatory water-use restrictions for the first time in at least a decade, according to utilities department spokeswoman Debbie Ragan. More than 200 people have suffered from heat-related emergencies in Tulsa and Oklahoma City since June 17, when the agency issued its first heat alert, said Lara O'Leary, spokeswoman for the Emergency Medical Services Authority of Oklahoma. Forecasters say people should limit outdoor activity during the hottest times of day, wear lightweight clothing, drink plenty of water and watch for signs of heat exhaustion, which include heavy sweating, pale and clammy skin, a weak pulse, fainting and vomiting. At the peak of the past week's heat wave, more than 20 states from the Plains to the Northeast were under heat advisories.","Heat wave hits many southern states this week .

1373,"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Bret is expected to strengthen as it moves away from the Bahamas and out to sea, the National Hurricane Center said Monday. As of 2 p.m., Bret -- the second tropical storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season -- was about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Great Abaco Island, according to the hurricane center. The storm had been about 65 miles (105) from the island earlier Monday. The storm is drifting to the north-northeast and is expected to pick up speed and strength as it moves away from land, according to forecasters. Grand Bahama Island and the Abaco Islands in the northwest Bahamas nevertheless remained under a tropical storm warning Monday. Bret could dump 2 to 4 inches of rain in the northwest Bahamas. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) Monday afternoon, with higher gusts.","Tropical Storm Bret begins to move away from land .

1374,"(CNN) -- A compromised levee in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, failed Tuesday, forcing authorities to order more evacuations in the region. The levee failed in at least four locations along a two-mile stretch along the Black River, City Manager Doug Bagby said. The failure was sending floodwaters from the Black River into a populated but rural area of Butler County, sparing the city of Poplar Bluff, said the city's deputy police chief, Jeff Rolland. Authorities were worried about another one to three inches of rain in the forecast. It was unclear how many people might eventually be affected by the flooding, Butler County Sheriff's Detective Scott Phelps said. As of midafternoon Tuesday, several hundred homes had been evacuated in the county, he said. The breaks occurred between Poplar Bluff and the community of Qulin, about 12 miles to the southeast. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said 59 water rescues were conducted and nearly 7,000 people had to be moved in Butler County. Bagby said about 1,000 of them are city residents, with more than 200 being sheltered at Black River Coliseum. Flood levels are dropping slowly, Bagby said, and people may be able to return to their homes Wednesday afternoon if the trend continues. ""It's sunny in Poplar Bluff right now,"" Bagby said on Tuesday afternoon. The city has received 15 inches of rain in the last four days, Rolland said -- five of them in just one storm Monday. ""It's just extraordinary,"" Rolland said. Nixon deployed about 200 members of the Missouri National Guard to Poplar Bluff and the southeastern corner of the state for what the National Weather Service said could be record flooding. Nixon ordered troops to help with efforts to shore up levees near Poplar Bluff and other river communities, among other duties. ""A lot of people are getting very worried that they're going to see higher levels than they've ever seen before,"" said Aaron Luke, a Nashville resident, who visited family in the Poplar Bluff area over the weekend. Luke left his car at an aunt's house north of Poplar Bluff when rising waters prevented him from leaving the area. ""I had to grab a rental car to get out and return to Nashville,"" he said, after using a boat to get across a swollen creek. Authorities ordered residents most at risk to evacuate immediately. Other residents near the river were asked to closely monitor developments and water levels in their neighborhoods, the police department said. Daryl Nelson helped evacuate his father and sister from the south end of the city. ""You don't know when it's going to be over and you can get back in,"" he told CNN affiliate KFVS. ""It's better than getting everything ruined."" Poplar Bluff resident Alleesha Gloyd, 29, said many streets were flooded Monday night. ""They're not driving wisely at all,"" she said of area motorists. CNN's Ed Payne, Phil Gast, Marlena Baldacci, Michael Pearson and Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","59 people rescued in Poplar Bluff area .

1375,"(CNN) -- Jam band Phish broke attendance records and raised more than $1.2 million for victims of flooding this week in their home state of Vermont. The show took place at the Champlain Valley Expo in Essex Junction on Wednesday night -- nearly three weeks after Vermont experienced deadly, damaging floods caused by the remnants of Hurricane Irene. ""It was amazing and inspiring to see so many people come together through music to aid the great state of Vermont,"" Phish guitarist and singer Trey Anastasio said. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin was among those attending the show, thanking Phish for coming back to Vermont, a state they hadn't played since 2004. ""There's nothing better than the state of Vermont, nothing better than Phish fans,"" Shumlin said. ""It's been seven years... It was worth the wait!"" The proceeds -- the final tally announced in a press release from the band -- will help Vermont, ""rebuild better than the way Irene found us,"" the governor said. Vermont was one of the hardest-hit states as Irene made its way up the East Coast. Many communities in the small state were cut off as floodwaters washed away roads and bridges. Phish's decision to get involved in the recovery effort wasn't a difficult one. ""We think it's a really nice way to come back and give back to a state that has given us so much,"" keyboardist Page McConnell said when the band announced its intention to hold the concert. Phish partners with local charities in an effort to make positive impact in each of the towns they visit while out on tour, and in 1997 the band created the WaterWheel foundation to oversee its charitable activities. That includes fundraisers following disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Japan earlier this year. When it came to Vermont, the state where Phish was formed in 1983, however, the band concluded, ""We have to do something bigger,"" said Beth Montuori Rowles from the WaterWheel Foundation. Despite having little time to plan, the concert came together, ""quite easily,"" Montuori-Rowles said . The band, on its website, thanked numerous major donors who underwrote the concert's production expenses. Proceeds of the concert -- from ticket sales, merchandise sales, download and webcast sales -- will be directed to the WaterWheel Foundation and to the Vermont Community Foundation. Both organizations continue to raise money online for the Vermont recovery effort. And police in Essex Junction, located in western Vermont just outside Burlington, said the event also went ""better than expected"" from their end. There were no arrests or serious injuries, with only a slight traffic back-up for an hour as the gates opened. ""I can't remember a group as large and as pleasant to deal with as this one,"" Essex Junction Police Capt. Brad LaRose said. The police department even got in on the philanthropy, with some officers donating their time back to the cause. Rich Lewis, the Champlain Valley Expo's public relations director, described the fans that came out Wednesday night as ""upbeat"" and ""appreciative."" The concert, while a tiring event for Lewis and his staff who had just closed the state's fair at the same venue last week, was ""substantial on all levels.""

1376,"Maumelle, Arkansas (CNN) -- A man whose naked body was found next to a sleeping TV weatherman in an unfilled tub earlier this month died from asphyxiation, authorities said Thursday, but there was ""no indication"" he was strangled. Maumelle, Arkansas, police Lt. Jim Hansard noted that the medical examiner cited other contributing factors in 24-year-old Dexter Williams' death, including intoxication with methamphetamine and amphetamines. Police said the investigation remains open and there is ""no indication (from the medical examiner) in any way that there was a strangulation,' and the manner of death remains 'undetermined."" Police say Williams' body was discovered September 5 in a hot tub with former TV meteorologist Brett Cummins. Cummins, 33, has not been charged in the case. He has since resigned from KARK-TV in Little Rock. The owner of the home, Christopher Barbour, found Williams' body at the bottom of an empty tub, his face blue and purple and a chain resembling a dog collar around his neck, according to a Maumelle police report. Maumelle police will soon turn the case over to the Pulaski County Prosecutor's Office, which will determine whether any charges will be filed.","Dexter Williams died of asphyxiation, medical examiner rules .

1377,"(CNN) -- A lightning strike sparked a fire Monday that destroyed the Caribbean island home of Virgin Group Chairman Richard Branson, a statement from the media mogul said. About 20 people, including Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet, were in the house at the time of the fire, which broke out around 4 a.m., Branson said. No one was injured. ""Many thanks to Kate Winslet for helping carry my 90-year(-old) mum out of the main house to safety,"" Branson wrote in the e-mailed statement. Branson said the house, located on Necker Island, the 74-acre private island the billionaire owns in the British Virgin Islands, was destroyed, along with ""thousands of photographs and my notebooks."" ""But all my family and friends are well -- which in the end is all that really matters,"" he said. The lightning strike that caused the fire occurred in the midst of Tropical Storm Irene, which strengthened into a hurricane early Monday. Pictures show the house completely engulfed in flames against an ominous sky. ""Currently just huddled up with family and friends in the continuing tropical storm realising what really matters in life,"" Branson said. He promised to rebuild, saying ""we'll create something even more special out of the ruins."" In addition to Branson's private residences on the island, Necker is also open as a luxury resort that can accommodate up to 28 guests for those who can afford the hefty $54,500-a-night price tag. The island has been featured on such TV programs as ""MTV Cribs,"" and TV personalities Nick Lachey and Vanessa Minnillo were recently married on the island.","The fire was sparked by a lightning strike during Tropical Storm Irene .

1378,"(CNN) -- The death toll from a string of hurricanes and tropical storms in Haiti has risen to nearly 800 people, an official with the Haitian Red Cross says. A man carries drinking water through the flooded streets of Gonaives, Haiti, last month. Jean Pierre Guiteau, the group's executive officer, said they suspected the numbers may climb further because many people were still missing. Heavy rainfall from four major storms in August and September created fatal flooding and mudslides in Haiti. Tropical Storm Fay caused flooding and significant damage when it hit the impoverished island nation. Heavy rains from Hurricane Gustav, considered a major hurricane, caused destructive mudslides after it made landfall in Haiti on August 26, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Tropical Storm Hanna passed over northern Haiti in early September, bringing heavy rain and flooding. Ike, another major hurricane, caused flooding and mudslides. The United States has provided more than $30 million in humanitarian assistance to Haiti in the wake of the storms, the U.S. Agency for International Development said. The United Nations' Central Emergency Response Fund has allocated more than $4 million for post-hurricane humanitarian aid, the agency said. The U.S. Navy sent the USS Kearsarge to Haiti last month to deliver more than 1,400 metric tons of relief supplies, in support of USAID and the World Food Program. It delivered heavy lift helicopters to carry rice, water, plywood and other supplies to Haitians, and also carried medical and engineering teams to remote parts of the country. Even before the tropical weather struck Haiti, an estimated 2.3 million Haitians had fallen into food insecurity, with dramatic increases in prices for staple foods, USAID has said.","Death toll from string of hurricanes and tropical storms in Haiti rises to nearly 800 .

1380,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Three bomb blasts in northwest Pakistan killed four security personnel Tuesday and destroyed an oil tanker carrying fuel for NATO forces in Afghanistan, police told CNN. One of the bombs was planted along a road and exploded as a military convoy drove by, said senior police official Muhammad Iftikhar Khan. Two soldiers were killed in the explosion and four others were injured, Khan said. The blast took place in a village in Bannu, a district adjacent to the Taliban strongholds of Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border. About an hour north of Bannu, a roadside bomb in the outskirts of Peshawar killed two policemen and injured two others as they drove by in their police van, police official Amjad Khan told CNN. A third planted bomb in the outskirts of Peshawar destroyed a parked oil tanker and damaged four others, Khan said. All five tankers were carrying fuel for NATO troops in Afghanistan. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but militants in the region have frequently targeted Pakistani security forces and supply trucks headed for Afghanistan in an effort to undermine U.S. and NATO efforts there. On Monday, armed militants in southwest Pakistan torched two other oil tankers, said Azam Shahwani, a senior government official in Baluchistan province.

1381,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- The death toll from historic floods in southern Brazil continued to creep upward Monday, with 112 reported dead, the state news agency said. People make their way through floodwaters in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina last week. Officials say 19 people remain missing and nearly 79,000 residents have been left homeless, according to the state-run Agencia Brasil. Many of the deaths have been caused by mudslides. The city of Ilhota in the hard-hit state of Santa Catarina has recorded 37 fatalities, the most of any municipality, Agencia Brasil said. In the city of Maximus in Luis Alves state, eight rescuers were injured over the weekend, one of them gravely, the news agency said. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Monday that Santa Catarina will be rebuilt and become just as strong as it was. ""We cannot lose hope,"" Lula said. ""We must be convinced that people will reconstruct the state of Santa Catarina. There is a national solidarity never seen before in the history of the country."" Lula flew over some of the flooded areas last week and proclaimed the disaster one of the worst in the country's history. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" Lula said Thursday. He said last week he was releasing 1.97 billion Reals (US$854 million) in aid to the affected areas, especially Santa Catarina. Officials have distributed 880 tons of food, nearly 1 million liters of water and 60 tons of clothing, toys and cleaning and personal hygiene material, Agencia Brasil said Monday. Authorities also were warning residents in flooded areas to be careful with food and water they consume. Food that has been under water or moist should not be eaten unless it's in a sealed plastic bag or a can, they said. The health secretary for Santa Catarina also said residents who drink contaminated water run the risk of getting hepatitis A and diarrhea. The disaster also is having an economic effect, with bridges, roads, houses and buildings destroyed. The federation of industries said the closed port in Itajai is costing $33 million a day. The port is the major terminal for frozen goods in Brazil and second in the transport of containers, Agencia Brasil said. Port Superintendent Arnaldo Schmitt said last week part of the terminal could be back in operation in two weeks.","NEW: Authorities warn about health risks of flood-contaminated water, food .

1382,"Saint-Marc, Haiti (CNN) -- Patients arrive at the front gates of St. Nicholas Hospital hunched over and groaning, only to be greeted by chaos and confusion. Getting inside isn't easy, but once in, aid organizations and local staff try to treat those most vulnerable to the ravages of cholera in an area of wooden benches grouped as a triage area. Many here are still lying in the open air and are sprawled out on concrete with anxious relatives holding re-hydration fluid, hoping it will treat the cholera now stalking this rural area about 60 miles northwest of the capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince. Death toll passes 250 . Those most at risk are the very old and the very young. Dozens of infants who lay crying and uncomfortable on their mothers' laps, dehydrated and weak. Haiti's health minister, Dr. Alex Larsen, told CNN in a telephone interview that he believes the cholera outbreak is stabilizing. Larsen added that reports of the outbreak spreading are so far unsubstantiated. BLOG: Cholera can be deadly within hours . The United Nations confirmed to CNN on Saturday that there are five confirmed cases of cholera in the capital but those cases originated from the area in and around Saint-Marc. CNN toured St. Nicholas Hospital with a team from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. The team is here to support the government's efforts and advise on how to best mitigate and contain the outbreak. ""It is encouraging that the mortality rate seems to be coming down."" says Dr. Eric Mintz, a scientist with the CDC who specializes in diarrheal diseases. Mintz adds that while the outbreak is likely to spread, the fatality rates should continue to drop, and the water, sanitization and hygiene infrastructure in the country can be strengthened in time to avoid a full-scale disaster.","St. Nicholas Hospital in Haiti is packed with cholera victims .

1383,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Three suicide attackers shot their way onto the grounds of a five-star hotel in the northwest Pakistani city of Peshawar and set off a car bomb, killing at least seven people and wounding dozens, officials said. Pakistani police gather at the five-star hotel destroyed by a car bomb. Peshawar Police Chief Safwat Ghyour said about 40 people were wounded in the attack on the Pearl Continental Hotel, which is often frequented by foreigners and diplomats. The blast inflicted severe damage on the building, which is surrounded by a security wall, and destroyed dozens of cars in the parking lot, police and witnesses said. The information minister for Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, put the death toll at 11, with at least 50 wounded. A local official, Sahib Zada Muhammad Anis Khan, said one of the dead was a Nigerian national who worked for the United Nations. Qhazi Jamil, senior superintendent of Peshawar police, told CNN three gunmen in a pickup fired on security guards at the hotel's entrance gate and forced their way inside before setting off the bomb. Hussain and the chief of Peshawar's bomb-disposal squad said the bomb contained about 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of explosives. Peshawar is the capital of North West Frontier Province, which has suffered a spate of bombings on civilian targets in the wake of the Pakistani military's ongoing military offensive against Taliban militants. Sajjan Gohel, an international security analyst at the Asia-Pacific Foundation in Britain, said the blast appeared to be a response to the government's offensive. ""It has been criticized very heavily in the tribal areas because of the fact that the Pakistani military has been using helicopter gunships against the Taliban, which has resulted in very high civilian casualties,"" Gohel said. He said people in the region are sympathetic to the Taliban, the Islamic militia that ruled most of Afghanistan before the September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington by its al Qaeda allies. ""This is where winning hearts and minds is so key and important, which the military are failing to do,"" he said. However, hundreds of Pakistani villagers who have formed an anti-Taliban militia are currently fighting to remove the Islamic militants from their region of northwestern Pakistan, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN. Abbas told CNN the Pakistani military is supporting the villagers, who turned against the Taliban after a suicide attack on a local mosque during Friday prayers left at least 40 dead. The Pearl Continental is owned by the same group as the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, which was destroyed in a suicide truck bombing in September.

1384,"Washington (CNN) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission told Congress on Thursday that the likelihood of a Fukushimi Daiichi-type event in the United States is ""very, very small."" However, it said an ongoing study of the Japanese disaster will probably lead to changes to increase safety at the nation's 104 commercial power plants. The commission said, in a nutshell, it expects to require nuclear plants to be prepared for bigger natural disasters, to survive longer power outages and to consider the possibility of simultaneous disasters affecting multiple reactors, as happened in Japan. Commissioner George Apostolakis said one of the lessons of Fukushima is ""humility."" ""I believe that, as a community of safety analysts, we were pretty confident that there would be no new surprises,"" Apostolakis said. ""Fukushima has challenged that belief."" Commissioners said the commission's core safety concept, a belts-and-suspenders policy called ""Defense in Depth,"" is sound. The policy requires power plant designers and operators to have multiple, redundant layers of defense to respond to failures so that no single layer of response is relied on. They also endorsed support for regulations that require plants to be designed to withstand the strongest natural disasters on record for that location, with an added margin of safety. But while voicing support for both concepts, some commissioners said ""Defense in Depth"" needs to be deeper and margins of safety wider. Currently, emergency plans for most U.S. nuclear reactors envision one nuclear reactor being in danger. At Fukushima, all four operating reactors were affected by the tsunami that followed an earthquake in March. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also requires plans to evacuate a 10-mile zone around power plants, but U.S. authorities recommended that U.S. citizens within 50 miles of Fukushima evacuate. Japan to hand out radiation meters to children . ""If there's an overall lesson we can learn from this, I think that is you can't ... predict everything that will happen in the future. You can't predict every earthquake, every tsunami, but ... you have to be able to recover from whatever happens,"" Commissioner William Magwood IV said. Currently, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission task force is midway through a 90-day review of the Fukushima incident, searching for lessons that can quickly be applied to U.S. plants. The 90-day study, to be released July 19, will be followed by a lengthier study involving more long-term changes. At a hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, commissioners discussed some of the lessons learned. They include: . -- The commission needs to evaluate its ""station blackout"" rule concerning how power plants deal with the loss of electrical power, Commissioner William Ostendorff said. ""I think that the commission will probably receive from the task force perhaps some recommendations in this area,"" he said. -- Backup batteries used to power control room functions during blackouts are insufficient, Apostolakis said. ""Clearly, the main message from Fukushima is that four hours, or sometimes eight, is not sufficient,"" he said. ""Interestingly enough, when the requirement of four or longer hours was put in place, it was actually a conservative estimate. (Regulators) looked at the time it took to recover AC power (during a blackout). The average was about two hours, so to be conservative, they doubled it. And now we have this accident that shows its very inadequate, so that's certainly something we have to look into."" -- The commission needs to consider the impact that spent-fuel pool problems can have during a larger event, Chairman Gregory Jaczko said. ""I think we've had a singular focus, perhaps, on reactor safety in the event of accidents and not put enough attention into considering the impact of spent fuel pools (on the response),"" he said. -- The commission needs to consider staging of emergency and back-up equipment. After the September 11 terrorist attacks, the commission required plants to stage auxiliary diesel generators near nuclear plants, Magwood said. ""We require those units to be just a very short distance away from, say, reactor buildings. Clearly, if we had those procedures in place and had experienced a Fukushima-type event, that equipment would have been wiped out along with a lot of the other side equipment. That was a significant revelation for me and something I think we have to address,"" he said. -- The commission needs to review first-responder communication capabilities. ""It's always very difficult to have communication in a crisis situation, and I think that's an area that we can always be exercising and improving,"" Commissioner Kristine Svinicki commission. Commissioners also said the agency must study what led to the hydrogen explosions that plagued Fukushima but said not enough is known about the incident to recommend changes. ""We've always asked ourselves the question, 'Are the plants still safe? Is there anything we need to do today to address that?' And the answer continues to be 'No,' "" Jaczko said. ""We want to get good information, (and) we have time to do that. ""The likelihood of something like this happening in the United States is still very, very small, because these are really very, very unlikely types of events,"" he said. Jaczko said the current 90-day review ""may seem like a very long time, (but) to the people doing the review, it's going by in a millisecond."" ""But it's important that we get it right, and I think that so far, they are looking at all the right things,"" he said.","Commissioners tell Congress of potential changes to power plants .

1385,"(CNN) -- Infectious disease detectives worldwide rushed Thursday to find the cause of an outbreak of a rare strain of E. coli that has spread to 10 countries and is blamed for at least 16 deaths and hundreds of illnesses. Nine patients in Germany had died of a form of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, according to the World Health Organization, which cited Tuesday figures as its most recent. Six had died of enterohemorrhagic E. coli, EHEC, a strain of E. coli that causes hemorrhaging in the intestines and can result in abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea. One person in Sweden has also died. Across Europe, 499 cases of HUS and 1,115 cases of EHEC have been reported, WHO said on its website. In addition to Germany and Sweden, cases have been identified in Austria, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. All but two of the cases occurred in people who had recently visited northern Germany or, in one case, had contact with a visitor from northern Germany, the organization said. Scientists at the Beijing Genomic Institute said the outbreak of infection in Germany is caused by a new ""super-toxic"" E. coli strain, though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the strain has been seen before. ""We have very little experience with this particular strain, but it has been seen before,"" said Robert Tauxe, deputy director of the CDC's division of foodborne diseases. The CDC said the strain is very rare and added that, while it is not aware of any cases ever having been reported in the United States, it is aware of a few previous reports of the strain in other countries. Britain's Health Protection Agency has said that the strain suspected in the outbreak is ""rare"" and ""seldom seen in the UK."" Though WHO said it does not recommend any trade restrictions related to the outbreak, Russia announced a ban Thursday on fresh vegetable imports from the European Union. Russia imposed the vegetable ban because ""no one wants to get sick. It is a natural protective measure taken in response to events that are happening in Europe today,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said Thursday. Gennady Onishchenko, head of the Russian Federal Agency for Health and Consumer Rights, issued a statement saying the ban will remain in effect ""until we become convinced that this situation is resolved."" Customs officials have been instructed to prevent the produce from entering the country, according to Onishchenko, while supermarkets and food chains in Russia were told to withdraw European vegetables from their produce bins. Frederic Vincent, the European Commission's health spokesman, called the move ""disproportionate."" ""The commission will be writing today to the Russian authorities, and we will be liaising and working with them in the coming days to try to find a solution,"" Vincent said. The commission is the EU's executive body. Yelena Skrynnik, Russia's agriculture minister, issued a statement assuring Russians that, despite the ban, ""the volume of home-grown vegetable production combined with exports (from other countries) is sufficient to fully meet Russia's domestic demand."" In 2010, the imports of tomatoes and cucumbers from the EU amounted to, respectively, 11% and 5% of all imports of those vegetables into Russia, the Russian Agriculture Ministry said. The ban could potentially affect some larger cities in the European part of the country, where about 90% of vegetables are imported, said Sergey Shugayev, chairman of the Rural Russia Association. China and Turkey are the two largest exporters of fresh vegetables into Russia, according to the Russian Greenhouses Association. The European Food Safety Alert Network initially said EHEC was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain. But authorities said Thursday the source had not been pinpointed. Spain's Ministry of Health, Social Politics and Equality said Thursday that all samples of Spanish produce that it analyzed had proved negative. Spain's ambassador to Britain, Carles Casajuana i Palet, told CNN that Spanish produce had been ""completely cleared"" and are ""safe for all consumers."" But, he added, the matter had damaged the country's growers ""and we are sure there will have to be compensations"" through the European Union. Britain's Health Protection Agency on Thursday confirmed that there were four new cases in England suspected to be related to the outbreak, bringing the total number of cases in the country to seven. The agency said that it was ""reminding people traveling to Germany to follow the advice of the authorities and avoid eating raw tomatoes, cucumbers and leafy salad including lettuce, especially in the north of the country, until further notice. In addition, anyone returning from Germany with illness including bloody diarrhea should seek urgent medical attention and make sure they mention their recent travel history."" The ban on fresh vegetables from the European Union comes three days after Russia blocked the import of fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and salad greens from Germany and Spain. On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates imposed a temporary ban on cucumbers from Spain, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands.

1386,"(CNN) -- Indonesia began cloud-seeding operations over the island of Sumatra on Monday in an attempt to trigger rain to put out fires creating thick blankets of haze over parts of Sumatra and neighboring Singapore and Malaysia. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), said that three Spanish-built CASA 212-200 aircraft were deployed on Friday to Sumatra. The rain-inducing operations will continue in three  specific areas for the next 90 days, Sutopo told CNN. According to the agency, the number of hot spots in South Sumatra in September has reached 1,241. Hundreds more have been detected on the island of Kalimantan, which is Indonesia's side of Borneo island. South Sumatra has the highest number of hot spots, or areas of high temperatures that could indicate peat or forest fires. Sutopo says ground operations to extinguish the fires are also ongoing. These include spraying, controlled burning, building trenches to limit the spread of the fire and sluices around the burning peat. Haze from forest and peat fires has been a perennial problem for the region, particularly during the dry months. Slash-and-burn techniques to clear land and droughts have been blamed for the fires in the past. Using uncontrolled fires to clear land is illegal but enforcement has been an issue. The worst incidence of fires and haze was in 1997 to 1998. The World Wide Fund for Nature estimates nearly 10 million hectares was burned. The Asian Development Bank put the damages and losses at about US $9 billion for Indonesia and its neighboring countries. The fires also had significant impact on Indonesia's wildlife, including orangutans, tigers and elephants and protected national parks.

1387,"London (CNN) -- A funeral took place in London Friday for Mark Duggan, the father of four whose death after his cab was stopped by armed police led to protests that expanded into four days of rioting. A horse-drawn cortege processed through the streets from his parents' home in the north London neighborhood of Tottenham to the church in nearby Wood Green where the ceremony was held, with many mourners on hand. Duggan, 29, died on August 4 from a gunshot to the chest after a police unit that deals with gun crime stopped the cab that was carrying him. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is still investigating the circumstances around his death and said Thursday that it ""is far from reaching any conclusions."" A peaceful protest in Tottenham two days after his death turned violent and rioting spread to other parts of London and other English cities over the following days. Michael Jarrett, 47, from Tottenham was among hundreds who turned out to pay their respects to Duggan and his family. In 1985, Jarrett's mother, Cynthia, died after four police officers searched her home in Tottenham's Broadwater Farm housing project. Anger over her death sparked the Broadwater Farm riots, in which a policeman died. The area's reputation was tainted for years. Speaking outside the church where Duggan's funeral was held, Jarrett told CNN little had changed in the decades since then. ""The ethnic minorities are still being mistreated,"" he said. ""I don't think a lot changed, the mood in the area is one of regret and sorrow. But there is still a lot of mistrust where the police are concerned."" He said politicians who blamed people who ""just want to loot, steal and riot"" for the unrest that broke out last month need to look at the underlying problems behind such behavior. ""I actually condemn the looting and the burning of buildings,"" he said, ""but I understand the situation behind and the frustration and anger behind it. That I do understand. Fully."" Yvonne Collail, 47, from Tottenham told CNN she was concerned that the recent trouble in Tottenham had made everyone less safe and meant the police would have to carry guns, which is unusual in Britain. London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement beforehand that a senior officer had ""met with the parents and family of Mark Duggan and discussed the policing arrangements"" for the funeral. ""In line with the family's wishes, the policing will reflect the family's desire for a local, peaceful and dignified funeral,"" the statement said. Questions remain unanswered about the circumstances of Duggan's death. Prime Minister David Cameron said last month that Duggan had been shot by police but the IPCC has yet to reach a formal conclusion. In a letter to the Times of London published Thursday, the IPCC said the newspaper's headline indicating that an officer had been cleared of shooting Duggan was incorrect and ""irresponsible."" The IPCC said it is continuing to follow numerous leads as it investigates Duggan's death, including examining security camera footage, conducting forensic tests and talking to witnesses. The commission acknowledged that ""people want answers,"" but urged them ""not to rush to judgment until they see and hear the evidence for themselves."" A Metropolitan Police statement Thursday said: ""The firearms officer involved in the shooting of Mark Duggan is not about to return to operational firearms duties."" Initial reports that Duggan shot at police were ruled out by ballistic tests, which found that a bullet that lodged in one officer's radio was of a type issued to police. The IPCC also said there had been no exchange of fire. A handgun that was not police issue was found at the scene, the IPCC said, but there was no evidence it had been fired during the incident.

1388,"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- At least 20 bus passengers were killed and a dozen others injured in a traffic accident Tuesday in Indian-administered Kashmir. A senior police officer said the bus rolled into a deep gorge beside the Jammu-Srinagar highway after it skidded off the road when the driver lost control. ""The bus hurtled down several hundred meters from the serpentine mountainous road ... killing 18 passengers on the spot while 14 injured were evacuated to hospital,"" Dilbagh Singh, inspector general of police in the Jammu zone, told CNN. ""We pressed into service army choppers to ferry the injured to hospital for specialized treatment. Two injured persons succumbed in hospital, taking the toll to 20,"" he added. He said some of the injured were in serious condition. The government quickly announced it will provide compensation payments to the families of the dead and to the injured.

1389,"(CNN) -- All 21 people aboard a military plane that went missing off Chile's Pacific coast, near the Juan Fernandez islands, are dead, Defense Minister Andres Allamand said Saturday. According to preliminary information, the passengers died instantly on impact, according to Allamand. At least four bodies were found earlier Saturday, one day after the plane went missing. Two of the bodies recovered were female and two were male, government spokesman Andres Chadwick told reporters. The four bodies were flown to the capital, Santiago, where authorities identified the victims. An emergency beacon originally believed to be from the plane was also found Saturday, but is now thought to have belonged to a fishing boat, CNN Chile reported. Gen. Maximiliano Larraechea, secretary general of the air force, earlier told Chile's state-run broadcaster TVN that one of the plane's locator devices had been found. TVN quoted him as saying he was almost certain the plane had crashed because of the number of items recovered. The plane tried to land twice before losing contact, Allamand told reporters Friday. Chile's TVN Executive Director Mauro Valdes said five of the passengers were employees of the television station, including Felipe Camiroaga, a well-known and popular TV personality. The country's president, Sebastian Pinera, vowed to investigate the circumstances of the crash. ""This is a tough blow to our country, but it is precisely these moments of anguish and uncertainty that require the unity and solidarity of all Chileans,"" CNN Chile reported the president said Friday.

CNN affiliate Nine News showed footage of the bizarre scene -- a Cheetah S200 dangling nearly 40 feet from the ground at a fair in Old Bar, on the seaside in New South Wales. New South Wales Police said investigators are looking into the mishap. The pilot, 53, and his passenger, 32, were retrieved by crews using a crane, as were a boy, 9, and girl, 13. The children were trapped on the ride for more than an hour, police said. The two men had to wait a little longer.

1391,"(CNN) -- The top security official in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon was found shot dead and burned inside a truck in the city of Monterrey, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing state officials. The governor's office confirmed the death of Homero Guillermo Salcido Trevino, head of the control, command and communications operations for the state police. He suffered five bullet wounds, and his body was set on fire inside his official truck, officials said. Officials found the body Sunday night. Eighteen people were killed Monday in Padilla in the neighboring state of Tamaulipas, prosecutors said in a statement. Five Padilla residents were among those killed, the statement said, along with six people traveling in the city. Another seven bodies were dumped in the town square, the prosecutors said. Additionally, unspecified damage was done to Padilla's municipal palace, the lower judiciary court and the city police command. Tamaulipas is in the central northeast of Mexico, bordering Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. Padilla is about 200 miles from the U.S. border. The state prosecutors said state and local authorities were working the case and pledged cooperation with federal authorities as well. Northern Mexico has been plagued by a steady stream of violence fueled by the lucrative drug trade in Mexico. According to the government, there have been more than 34,600 drug-related deaths since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on the cartels in December 2006. Alejandro Poire, Mexico's national security spokesman, told CNN's Rafael Romo last week that half the more than 15,000 drug-related deaths last year occured in just three of the country's 32 states -- Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Tamaulipas. Thirty percent of the total is in Chihuahua alone, with most of those in Ciudad Juarez across the border from El Paso, Texas. ""We can get ahold of this violence,"" Poire said. ""We have shown it in other parts of the country, and we will do it because we have a comprehensive strategy to address crime and violence."" Monday's violence followed several incidents last week in the region that left another 18 people dead. On February 6, the remains of five men discarded along the highway between Monterrey and Reynosa in Tamaulipas were found, Notimex reported. The state news agency said the bodies were naked, except for plastic bags. A day earlier, gunmen clashed with soldiers in three separate incidents in Tamaulipas, leaving 13 people dead, the agency reported.

1392,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The Mount Merapi volcano in Indonesia erupted at least three times Tuesday, forcing thousands of nearby residents to flee. Indonesian media reported that 15 people were killed, including some journalists who were staying in a guesthouse to get close to the volcano. CNN could not independently verify those reports. Mount Merapi, which looms on the horizon north of the major city of Yogyakarta, is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and lies in one of the world's most densely populated areas. The volcano has a summit elevation of nearly 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Christian Awui, a rescuer at the scene, told CNN that the first thing that residents heard were sirens from an early warning system announcing the coming eruptions. ""There was panic,"" he said. ""You could hear the rumbles of the volcano."" People ran to a refugee camp about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) away. Because it was still dark, it was hard to tell how the eruptions compared with previous ones, Awui said. Some nongovernmental relief agencies were poised to offer immediate help. One of them was World Vision Indonesia, a Christian relief and development agency. ""Right now, our biggest concern is the children,"" said Fadli Usman, World Vision Indonesia's rapid assessment team leader. ""Children are always forgotten in the early moments of a disaster like this. My first task will be to assess the needs of the children and their families in the evacuation centers so our team can begin to help them."" Usman said about 1,500 people -- mostly women and children -- had found refuge at a four-building shelter about 7 miles (12 kilometers) from the volcano. The evacuees, he said, are worried about the men who stayed behind to guard their homes and fields on the mountain. A dusting of ash covered motorbikes and cars at the shelter parking lot, the relief worker said. The heavy ash fallout also obscured any view of the mountain from his location, he said. Usman had reported earlier that traffic was heavy as people left the region near the mountain. The traffic was not chaotic, he said, and the road was open and under control.

1393,"(CNN) -- The number of confirmed H1N1 flu cases worldwide surpassed 10,000, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. In the United States, at least 5,469 cases of swine flu have been reported. Commonly known as swine flu, the outbreak has sickened 10,176 people and caused at least 80 deaths, mostly in Mexico, the organization said. The actual number of people affected may be higher, as it takes time for national governments to confirm cases and report them to the global body. In the United States, at least 5,469 cases of swine flu have been reported, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has linked six deaths to the outbreak; health officials in New York have connected a seventh death -- a school official -- to the disease. Concern about the disease deepened Tuesday, even as authorities have said the outbreak may prove to be less severe than first suspected. A 44-year-old man died Tuesday in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, according to John Shelton of the St. Louis County Health Department. The man, whose name was not released, had been hospitalized for the past few weeks. He had visited Mexico and tests showed he had swine flu, Shelton said. However, the county medical examiner will determine the cause of the man's death. In New York, medical investigators determined that the death of a 16-month-old boy in Queens was not linked to the flu. The boy had a fever when his mother brought him to a hospital Monday and he died less than an hour later, drawing attention from investigators. That death came a day after an assistant principal from New York died after contracting the H1N1 virus. That man -- Mitchell Wiener -- had an underlying health condition, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, New York City's health commissioner and President Barack Obama's pick to lead the CDC. Wiener died Sunday of complications of the H1N1 virus, hospital and state officials said. If confirmed by the CDC, Wiener's death would be the seventh linked to swine flu in the United States. The CDC has confirmed three in Texas, two in Arizona and one in Washington state. Wiener's school is among a handful in New York that temporarily closed at the recommendation of the city's Health Department. Frieden said Sunday that ""with the virus spreading widely,"" closing affected schools ""will make little difference in transmission throughout New York City, but we hope will help slow transmission within the individual school communities."" The flu strain, which originated in Mexico, killed dozens of people there, causing U.S. officials to worry that it could take a similar toll north of the border. So far, however, it has acted similar to typical seasonal influenza, which usually can be treated successfully but can be deadly among the very old, very young and people with pre-existing health problems. CNN's Kara Devlin and Mary Snow contributed to this report.","H1N1 flu has caused at least 80 deaths, mostly in Mexico .

1394,"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- A 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck northern Peru on Wednesday, authorities said.

Authorities at the Geophysics Institute of Peru said no victims or significant damage had been reported. At least one aftershock had been recorded, the institute said. Lima residents felt a brief, but strong, tremor. The quake struck around 12:45 p.m. near Peru's border with Brazil at a depth of about 90 miles (145 kilometers).

1395,"BIHAR, India (CNN) -- Extreme flooding has displaced millions of people on either side of the India-Nepal border after a river burst its banks, authorities said Thursday. People walk along a flooded railway track in Madhepura, India. In India's northeastern state of Bihar, almost 3 million people have been affected by the worst flooding in decades, and more than 100,000 people have been displaced in southeastern Nepal after the breach last week. The Saptakoshi River in Nepal is the same one that flooded neighboring India's poorest state, although the Indians call it the Kosi River. In some stretches, it is three miles (5 km) wide. Nepalese Home Secretary Umesh Mainali said that of those displaced in Nepal, ""more than 40,000 are living in government run camps."" Many victims are taking shelter in schools and colleges. Residents were forced from their homes after an aged and damaged embankment on the river burst August 18 in Nepal. Water flowed so forcefully through the breach that it actually changed the course of the river, which now flows 75 miles (120 km) east of its original bed. Bad weather and washed-out roads -- including the region's main highway -- have hampered relief efforts, officials said. The heavy rains have also made repairing the breach difficult. Nepalese and Indian teams have been working separately to try to stem the flow of water, Mainali said. State-run Nepal Television reported Thursday that many Indian citizens are coming through the open border because of the availability of food and shelter. The Indian government said that about 50 people have been killed, revising the figure down from 87 deaths reported Wednesday. The Disaster Management Department in Bihar released a death toll of 12, an increase of two since Wednesday. There was no immediate explanation for the variance in numbers. ""Flood is understatement,"" Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said. ""It's a disaster.""  Watch how India is struggling to cope » . Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, head of the ruling Congress party, flew over the four most flooded districts of Supaul, Saharsa, Araria and Madhepura, the news agency Press Trust of India reported. Singh announced immediate aid of about $238 million and promised the delivery of 125,000 metric tons of grain to the region. CNN's Sara Sidner traveled by boat Thursday with some of the soldiers and called the mayhem ""enormous."" ""We have seen panic, we've seen sorrow, we've seen despair. ... Hundreds of people screamed to us from rooftops as we floated by."" The soldiers were trying to pull people to safety, Sidner said, ""but there are simply too many people to rescue and too few boats to do so. People were literally screaming, waving, running with suitcases in water trying to get to us."" The Home Ministry said that nearly 153,000 people have been evacuated, and 31,000 are staying in 155 relief camps. About 228,000 homes have been damaged. There was no number provided Thursday on the number of homes destroyed. Madhepura district, where 1 million people live in 378 villages, is the worst hit, officials said. There are 900,000 residents in Supaul and 250,000 in Araria. More than 2.7 million people in 1,600 villages have been affected, thousands of them marooned on thin strips of dry land peeking out from cloudy brown waters of the swollen Kosi River. With heavy rainfall forecast for the next two days, officials worry that the situation will get much worse. Indians call it the River of Sorrow. Every summer, from June to September, the relentless monsoon rains cause the Kosi to overflow, bringing untold misery. This year, though, it swallowed entire villages in areas unaccustomed to water that deep -- with the worst flooding in 80 years in the landlocked rural state. Government agencies, nongovernmental organizations and good Samaritans have begun doing what they can: using motorboats to rescue stranded residents, for example, or dropping thousands of food packets from the sky.  Watch as boats deliver supplies, provide rescue » . The scale of the disaster is overwhelming. About half the state is under water, a submerged area the size of the entire U.S. state of Delaware. One man told CNN's partner network IBN that he scrounged together 2,000 rupees ($45) to pay a boatman to ferry his family to safety. ""We agreed on 2,000 (rupees), and he upped it to 2,700 ($61) just like that,"" he said. ""What can I do? I paid him."" But many others stayed put. Nine hundred million Indians survive on less than 85 rupees ($2) a day, a British government study found this year. Many of them live in Bihar, the poorest and considered to be the most lawless state in India. They have nowhere to go. ""It's raining here. People are on rooftops begging to be rescued,"" CNN's Bharati Naik said while touring some of the affected area Thursday. There are ""not enough boats. Villagers are crying and extremely frustrated."" Officials worry that in coming days, stranded residents may start drinking the contaminated river water, raising fears of an epidemic. ""There is no water to drink,"" one man told CNN-IBN. ""We are hungry. We're thirsty. We have to drink something."" Roshan Kumar, a teacher from one of the flooded villages, arrived at an army base to seek help for his neighbors. About 30,000 people are stranded, he said. The army said it's doing all it can. Meanwhile, the water level in many areas continues to rise even as hope, among many, is beginning to falter.","India and Nepal battle worst flooding for decades .

1396,"(CNN) -- As the rest of the world waits to see if Japan can avert a nuclear catastrophe, a small band of experts is putting their lives at risk to prevent the disaster. Thousands of people living near the troubled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been evacuated from their homes because of the risk of radiation leaks from reactors damaged by last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami. But while most hurry in the opposite direction, about 180 plant workers are staying put -- despite the fact that doing so could result in serious illness or even death -- to battle the meltdown threat. ""The workers at this site are involved in a heroic endeavor,"" former U.S. Department of Energy Official Robert Alvarez told CNN. ""There is at least fragmentary evidence that in some places on this site there are life-threatening doses of radiation. I think they are doing enormously heroic work."" The workers left at the site are said to be highly trained and experienced nuclear operators, engineers and safety staff with highly specialized knowledge. Richard Wakeford, of the Dalton Nuclear Institute at the University of Manchester, said for many of them -- despite the highly unusual and potentially dangerous circumstances -- it will be just another day at the office. ""They see it as doing their job,"" he said. ""The Japanese in particular are dedicated to duty, and they will see it as their duty to do what they are doing."" According to the World Health Organisation, the average person is exposed to about 3.0 millisieverts (mSv) a year of radiation, from naturally-occurring, medical and other sources. But monitoring at the Fukushima Daiichi site has recorded radiation as high as 400 millisieverts an hour -- a level known to be a risk to human health. Exposure to 1,000 millisieverts (1 Sievert) of radiation can cause radiation sickness. ""It is difficult to get a clear picture, but there have been spikes in radiation to enormous doses, high enough to risk radiation sickness,"" said Dr. Ira Helfand, a member of the organization Physicians for Social Responsibility. ""These people are undergoing total body radiation, which can cause leukaemia and lymphoma as well as thyroid cancer later on,"" he said. Experts say lessons have been learned since the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl 25 years ago, when an unauthorized experiment saw radioactive dust spread across swathes of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and western Europe. Then, emergency workers were sent in with little or no protection to deal with the fallout. ""It was pandemonium; there was no monitoring, no idea of the risks,"" Wakeford said. By contrast, he said, staff at Fukushima Daiichi will be kitted out in protective clothing and breathing apparatus, they will be closely monitored and working in teams to limit their exposure to radiation. ""If I were them I would be more worried about the hydrogen explosions, which have been huge -- enough to blow the roofs off two buildings -- and which I think are a much bigger risk to the workers on the ground,"" he told CNN. But Dr. Helfand said reports suggested that the operation was not going 100% to plan, describing it as ""something out of an adventure movie."" ""We are in totally uncharted waters, people are ad-libbing to deal with the situation,"" he said. ""Using fire trucks to pump a mixture of sea water and boron onto the reactors is not in any of the manuals."" Wakeford said the workers will have known they may one day face a risky situation such as this. However, Helfand said that made them even braver, and their work more admirable. ""These workers are trained to understand the risks, but that only makes it all the more heroic that they have agreed to stay and work to prevent a disaster,"" he said. ""They know that if there is a reactor meltdown it could be a major disaster affecting huge areas and massive numbers of people, and they are risking their lives to try and prevent that. All of us owe them a huge debt of gratitude."" Professor Wakeford agreed: ""They are heroic, there is no doubt about that -- it's a pity that isn't recognised more. They are heroes, and I bow down to them.""","180 workers at Fukushima nuclear power plant trying to avert nuclear catastrophe .

1397,"(CNN) -- Joe Marshall was cruising across the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge when a piece of steel and a giant cable crashed down. He was just 50 yards away. The iReporter was just far enough away that he didn't see the debris as it fell. But he did see cars quickly move to the right lanes to avoid the mess. The falling debris forced the closure of the bridge and snarled traffic between Oakland and San Francisco, California, as commuters look for alternate ways to get to and from the cities. It's also forcing structural engineers to look at key questions around the nation's infrastructure: Has the nation done enough to address crucial bridges two years after the tragic collapse of a bridge in Minnesota that killed 13 people? The answer, experts say, is no. The pieces that fell this week raise even more troubling issues because repairs had just been made in September to the same section of the 73-year-old bridge, which spans the San Francisco Bay and carries an average of 280,000 vehicles daily. Over Labor Day weekend, crews worked to repair a damaged steel beam. ""The bridge has been inspected, and it is now safer than when we closed it,"" Randell Iwasaki, the director of the California Department of Transportation, said at the time. Abolhassan Astaneh-Asl, a structural engineering professor at the University of California, Berkeley, says he's concerned that authorities took a ""Band-Aid"" approach in September. ""It failed,"" he said. He's worried about what he calls ""fracture-critical"" bridges: roughly 460 bridges across the country that are in dire need of repairs. ""Following the Minnesota bridge collapse, there was a lot of discussion because of emotions,"" he said. ""I didn't really see a sustained effort that says, 'We are going to replace these fracture-critical bridges.' "" Federal regulators said support plates that were about half as thick as they should have been were the likely cause of the August 1, 2007, bridge collapse in Minnesota that killed 13 people and injured 145. The gusset plates -- metal plates that are meant to strengthen joists -- are believed to have failed on the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. A new bridge has since opened in Minnesota, what the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials hailed as one of the nation's Top 10 transportation feats this year. ""It is critical that our transportation systems receive the funding necessary to keep America moving. But even more important is that our state and local governments use that money to deliver projects that quickly meet the needs of our communities,"" John Horsley, the group's executive director, said in a recent report. But engineers say that's the problem: Repairs aren't happening quick enough. If a tragedy like the Minnesota collapse doesn't get people's attention, they wonder, what will? ""I have seen some lip service, but I have not seen a lot of momentum and action,"" said William Ibbs, a professor of civil engineering at UC-Berkeley. ""Part of that is due to the economic recession. When California has a budget deficit of $25 billion, they don't worry about bridges. They worry about closing the budget gap."" Fari Barzegar, a civil engineering consultant based out of Oakland, says the Minnesota collapse put critical bridge problems front and center before the American public. ""In the engineering community, we knew these things many years ago, and there were requests for money, which wasn't coming,"" Barzegar said. But he says funding hasn't kept up post-Minnesota. According to a 2009 American Society of Civil Engineers report, more than 26 percent of the nation's bridges are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials estimated in 2008 that it would cost roughly $140 billion to repair every deficient bridge in the country. Bridges are typically inspected every two years. ""If we don't start making substantial progress in five years, we will have more collapses,"" Ibbs said. The Bay Bridge opened in 1936 and spans 8.4 miles. It was the largest and most expensive bridge -- $77 million -- of its time. The bridge is best known to most Americans from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. A 50-foot section of the bridge collapsed during the quake, killing one person and prompting efforts to make it quake-tolerant. Part of the bridge, the West Span, is a suspension bridge. The other portion of the bridge, known as the East Span, is a truss-cantilever design. This week's falling debris happened on the East Span, which is in the process of being replaced.","Falling debris on Bay Bridge raises questions about repairs after Minnesota collapse .

1398,"(CNN) -- Thailand's capital was braced for unprecedented flooding Wednesday, amid the monsoon rains that have overwhelmed much of the country as well as Laos, Cambodia and the Philippines in recent weeks. ""It's going to be clearer over the next couple days"" whether Bangkok can be spared the brunt of the flooding said Matthew Cochrane, spokesperson for the International Red Cross in Bangkok. So far, 281 people have been killed and four people are missing in Thailand, according to the country's Flood Relief Operations Command. Some 60 of the country's 76 provinces have so far been affected, impacting some eight million people. ""It's really quite serious, these are the worst floods in Thailand since 1949,"" Cochrane said. ""These floods started in June really and started to move south and have really caused huge damage the whole way down,"" Cochrane said. ""They've affected hundreds and hundreds of villages and towns, they've wiped out 2.5 million acres of farmland. This is a very, very serious disaster."" Over half a million square kilometers -- an area the size of Spain -- are affected by the floods in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, according to CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. Asia's wet and wild 2011 explained . In Bangkok officials beefed up flood prevention measures as waterways, including the main Chao Phraya River, became bloated by rising water. ""There are walls still being built in the north of the city,"" Cochrane said Wednesday. ""One of the challenges is the areas where flood waters are typically diverted to protect the capital and protect the economic center of the country, those areas are already flooded, so there's potentially not much room for those waters to go."" ""For Bangkok we are still confident that the inner part of the city will be safe from (flooding),"" said Thitima Chaisaeng, Thailand government spokesperson, but the eastern and western parts of Bangkok face flooding. On Monday, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered canal dredging and reinforcement of flood-prevention embankments to protect the city, state-run news agency MCOT reported. In addition, three new flood-prevention walls were being built at two locations in Rangsit, in northern Bangkok, and in Taling Chan, in the western part of the city. Tourists warned as floods continue to wreak havoc in Thailand . The government needs another 1.5 million sandbags, MCOT reported. The prime minister called on the private sector to supply them, but said the government will buy all the needed sandbags by Wednesday, the news agency said. Meanwhile, around 1,200 people have taken shelter in a gymnasium at Bangkok's Thammasat University. Most of them are from neighboring Ayutthaya province and other flood-affected areas around the capital, said Thanawat Srisuwan, a volunteer at the makeshift shelter. The authorities have set up almost 200 other temporary shelters around the city to receive flood victims. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said plans were in place to evacuate people from nine areas, mainly in eastern Bangkok, if needed. Elsewhere, patients in two hospitals in Thailand's Ayutthaya and Nakhon Sawan provinces had to be evacuated after water reached the first floor, the flood operations command said. Multiple tropical weather systems have moved over the region in recent weeks, enhancing monsoon rains and leading to the flooding. Heavy rains are expected in Southeast Asia through the end of October. According to the government website Thaiflood.com, water from northern Thailand has finally reached lower parts of central Thailand, penetrating dykes in Pathumthani and Nonthaburi provinces and flooding outer areas of Bangkok, including the market in Nonthaburi and Chiang Rang road. The giant Rojana Industrial Park has halted operations for the time being, director Amara Charoengitwattanagun told MCOT, and the facility may be further damaged if the flooding worsens. One plant in the park, Single Point Parts, evacuated all workers from the premises and built flood prevention embankments around its building. Honda also confirmed operations at its Rojana plant have been halted. The Japanese automaker says the closure of the plant has already affected the manufacture of 4,500 vehicles. Meanwhile the UNESCO-listed Ayutthaya historical park, which includes the ruins of the old city of Ayutthaya, has been submerged since last week, according to local authorities. ""This is the worst flood in our historical site in 16 years,"" said Somsuda Leeyawanich, from the Thai Fine Arts Department. She said the water level in the park is almost three meters, compared to levels of around 80-90 centimeters during the floods of 1995. ""We are very concerned that if the site is under water more 30 days it may cause serious damage,"" she added. ""The temples are over 400 years old.""

1399,"(CNN) -- Is this just a normal year, or is the southwest monsoon acting more aggressively than normal? The 2011 tropical cyclone season in the west Pacific has been about average, not significantly above or below usual events. We did have a few consecutive storms that made landfall in the Philippines and other parts of South East Asia in late September and early October, such as Haitang, Nesat, and Nalgae -- but that had more to do with a steering pattern caused by high pressure over the Pacific, not the monsoon. The remnants of these storms did make their way farther into South East Asia, which likely enhanced the monsoon trough, thus leading to higher than average rainfall in countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Rainfall in most of Thailand is running 15% to 25% above average for the year (with a vast majority of that rain coming in the monsoon months of May to October). What exactly is the southwest monsoon? When does it start, end, and how is it generated? The southwest monsoon occurs during the northern hemisphere summer, and is caused by the land masses of the Indian subcontinent and South East Asia heating up faster than the Indian Ocean. This creates an influx of cooler, moisture-laden air from the ocean over the land. The southwest monsoon generally begins in mid-May and ends in late October/early November, though start and end times vary based on location. India, for example, has a southwest monsoon season that begins June 1 and ends September 30. Which countries are most affected by this monsoon? India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Philippines, and Malaysia are all affected in a significant way. India is largely considered the most ""affected,"" since it has the most-consistent monsoon season and depends the most on the rains of the monsoon for their life-sustaining agriculture. Some areas in Asia are recording above-average precipitation, such as in Bangkok which has so far received 58% more rainfall than usual this year. Why is the monsoon bringing more intense weather than usual in 2011? Some monsoons are more active than others, and there can be a myriad of reasons for this. I think the monsoon rainfall was enhanced in September by numerous tropical systems interacting with the monsoon trough. But other reasons could be much more complicated. There could be interactions with other large-scale weather and climate variables, such as El Nino or La Nina (in the case of this summer, La Nina was in place, and this does normally lead to higher than average precipitation in South East Asia). Sea-surface temperatures that are slightly above or below average can also lead to a variation in monsoon rainfall. Scientists will need to look into how all of these potential ingredients came together to produce these flooding rains. Also, the monsoon can be very active in one region, while being relatively inactive in another. It just so happens that for the last several weeks, the monsoon trough has been very active over central Thailand (in and around Bangkok), but other areas of the country have seen below average rainfall. In general are Asian summer monsoons becoming more destructive, or is it just cyclical? I believe it is just cyclical, and as mentioned above, depends on a wide variety of factors. The consequences, however, could be getting worse as populations and cities grow along the major rivers, which see rapid and intense rises during monsoon floods. Is there anything that Asia can do to help alleviate higher than usual rainfall? Better city planning and flood prevention strategies would be the biggest thing. Monsoon floods have always occurred, and these rivers naturally flood their banks occasionally (which is what makes the land in these areas so fertile). But if people continue to build more in these vulnerable areas, natural disasters like floods will continue to become more frequent.

1400,"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be one of the happiest days of Albert Florence's life. He had just secured funding for the home he was building and was traveling along Interstate 295 outside Trenton, New Jersey, one Sunday with his wife and child. That's when he first heard the sirens. ""We were not doing anything illegal, we were obeying the speed limits,"" Florence told CNN. ""It's just a normal routine stop, I thought."" A state trooper pulled the family SUV over to the side of the road. Even though his pregnant wife was driving, Florence said, the officer focused on him, discovering a warrant for his arrest. The alleged crime, he said, was an unpaid traffic fine. The 35-year-old Bordentown resident was arrested, handcuffed, and hauled off to the Burlington County Detention Center. That began what he called a ""six-day nightmare."" Florence was strip-searched by corrections staff, all because of what he terms a misunderstanding, a computer glitch. ""It was very disgusting. It was just a bad, bad experience,"" he told CNN Correspondent Kate Bolduan recently. ""I was just told, 'Do as you're told.' Wash in this disgusting soap and obey the directions of the officer who was instructing me to turn around, lift my genitals up, turn around, and squat."" Still shaken by the experience six years later, Florence sued, and now his appeal is before the U.S. Supreme Court. He is challenging the county's rules allowing routine strip searches of everyone arrested for even minor offenses, regardless of the circumstances. It is an important test of police detention powers in the post-9/11 security-conscious environment, a chance for the justices to offer clarity on an issue in which both inmates and the police have sought guidance. Oral arguments are scheduled for Wednesday. Court records show Florence was subjected to what he terms an invasive strip and visual body-cavity search. He was then held for nearly a week in the county lockup before being transferred to a Newark correctional facility, where he was subjected to another search before being placed in the general prison population. The next day a judge freed Florence, confirming what he had insisted all along, that the fine had been paid. The state argues the ""intake search"" for new prisoners was applied fairly, and applied to everyone. ""At the time Mr. Florence was admitted into the facility, the policy and the practice were to ask him to take off his clothes, take a shower and be subject to a visual search,"" said Carter Phillips, who will argue Burlington County's side of the case before the high court. ""His allegation is that they went further than that, and that's obviously a disputed matter at this point."" The case has yet to go to trial, pending outcome of the constitutional issues now before the high court. The justices will decide whether corrections officials should have a less intrusive, ""reasonable suspicion"" standard that would prevent the kind of search currently permitted in at least 32 states, including New Jersey. ""Where the counties went wrong is, they're doing a blanket policy of strip-searching anyone that comes in that jail or the prison. So basically, your constitutional rights stop at the prison door,"" said Susan Chana Lask, Florence's New York-based attorney. ""It's a balance -- what are you brought in there for? For failing to pay a fine? Or for murder? You know, failing to pay a fine does not justify strip-searching you."" But the counties counter by saying that kind of individualized scrutiny does not work in such a controlled environment, when so many new inmates need to be initially processed. ""The basic purpose, obviously, is to avoid the risk of contraband or weapons or anything else being smuggled into the jail, and so therefore, it protects not only the guards, but also protects all of the other inmates,"" Phillips told CNN. ""The question is: Do you have a reasonable expectation of certain kinds of privacy? And it seems to me when you are being lawfully admitted into a prison facility, and he was, at that point, your expectations of privacy essentially drop to zero and the importance of maintaining security rises to about 100 percent. So the balance, it seems to me, clearly favors the prison."" Florence also points out his alleged offense, failure to pay a fine, is not considered a criminal offense in the state and would not normally result in incarceration. His family said their efforts to free Florence were thwarted by repeated bureaucratic run-arounds. State officials draw a distinction between a strip-search policy for those newly admitted and for those later entering the general prison population. Such initial searches are justified, said the state, when applied for proper reasons, including potential health threats. Federal courts since the September 11, 2001, attacks had been at odds over the constitutionality of strip searches. The Constitution's Fourth Amendment protects against ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" The Supreme Court in 1979, in what is called the Bell precedent, upheld a search similar to the ones Florence had undergone for those prisoners who had contact visits with outsiders. Using a balancing test, the justices said the prison's security interest justified intrusion into the inmates' privacy. But subsequent appeals courts have found those arrested for minor offenses may not be strip-searched unless authorities have a ""reasonable suspicion"" that the person may be concealing a weapon or contraband such as drugs. In 2008, however, appeals courts in Atlanta and San Francisco found searches of every inmate coming into a prison population are justified, even without specific suspicions. Those opinions were the first of their kind since the 9/11 attacks and, along with Florence's case, now give the high court the chance to clarify an issue that a number of civil and human rights proponents have tried to highlight. Local jails in New Jersey at the time of Florence's arrest were subject to federal monitors after allegations that minority motorists and their passengers were being unfairly targeted for police stops and arrests. Stops of that nature are not at issue in the current appeal. Florence, who is African-American, is not alleging any racial discrimination by the state or individual officers. The case is Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, New Jersey (10-945).

1401,"(CNN) -- Thailand's devastating floodwaters are draining southward towards Bangkok Friday, and residents have been told to prepare for the worst when the spring high tide and a huge volume of water flowing down the Chao Phraya River merge over the next couple of days. Workers in the city are rushing to shore up barriers and warnings have been posted for the northern suburbs. ""Between seven and eight billion cubic meters of water a day is being released from the Bhumibol Dam in the north of the country, which is heavily affecting provinces like Nahkon Sawan and Ayutthaya,"" government official Wim Rungwattanajinda told CNN. ""From that, about one to 1.2 billion cubic meters of water is reaching Bangkok every day."" So far, 283 people have been killed and two people are missing in Thailand, according to the government website Thaiflood.com. Some 61 of the country's 76 provinces have so far been affected, impacting more than eight million people. More than 500,000 square kilometers -- an area the size of Spain -- are affected by the floods in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, according to CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. Asia's wet and wild summer explained . About 100 kilometers north of Bangkok, the UNESCO-listed historical city of Ayutthaya has now been submerged for 10 days, CNN's Paula Hancocks reports. Shops in Ayutthaya are mostly flooded and closed, and people unable to leave their homes are waiting for help to arrive. Roads have become rivers, with people having to swim or use boats to get food and water. ""Doctors are patrolling the flooded areas in small boats and are making house-calls to residents to those incapable of moving,"" Hancocks says. ""It's one of the worst hit areas in the country. Even if there are no more storms, one government estimate says it'll still take a month for the floodwaters to recede."" Flood warnings: Crocodiles, snakes and centipedes . Temples and monuments are unable to keep the rising waters at bay, and there are fears that the longer the city's treasures are covered by water, the more likely it will be that the damage could be permanent. ""This is the worst flood in our historical site in 16 years,"" said Somsuda Leeyawanich, from the Thai Fine Arts Department. She said the water level in the park is almost three meters, compared to levels of around 80-90 centimeters during the floods of 1995. ""We are very concerned that if the site is under water for more than 30 days it may cause serious damage,"" she added. ""The temples are over 400 years old."" Along with people and historical sites, animals are also are being severely affected by the floodwaters. Fifteen elephants, including seven mothers with babies and a nine-year-old known for its painting skills, are stranded on top of Ayutthaya's Royal Elephant Kraal. The elephants climbed on top of the building last week and are going hungry now that food can only be brought in small quantities via rowing boats. Elephants can swim but it's feared the babies would drown in the floodwaters if they attempt to escape. iReporter shares photos of Ayutthaya flooding . Meanwhile, the country's economy may be badly affected from the floods. Manufacturing areas just north of Bangkok have been particularly hard hit hard, including a Honda factory that has been submerged, ruining hundreds of cars. The giant Rojana Industrial Park has also halted operations for the time being, director Amara Charoengitwattanagun told state-run news agency MCOT, and the facility may be further damaged if the flooding worsens. One plant in the park, Single Point Parts, evacuated all workers from the premises and built flood prevention embankments around its building. ""The Thai finance ministry says overall damage from the floods could be more than $2 billion, with the worst yet still possibly to come,"" Hancocks says.

1402,"(CNN) -- The August downing of a Chinook helicopter in Afghanistan that killed 38 people, including 17 U.S. Navy SEALs, was caused by a rocket-propelled grenade, fired by insurgents, that struck the aircraft's aft rotor blade, the U.S. Central Command officially confirmed on Wednesday. An investigation determined that the ""operational planning and execution"" of the ill-fated August 6 mission in Wardak Province ""were consistent with previous missions, and that the forces and capabilities were appropriate given the agility required to maintain pressure on insurgent networks,"" CENTCOM said in a news release issued Wednesday. ""There was no evidence of a pre-planned ambush,"" CENTCOM said. The attack made for the the deadliest month for U.S. forces in Afghanistan in the 10 years since allied forces began their campaign there. Seventy-one American troops died in August, six more than in July 2010, which previously had been the worst month for U.S. casualties.

1403,"LONDON (CNN) -- The search for missing workers in a flooded Wales coal mine ended tragically Friday as rescuers discovered the fourth and final man's body, South Wales police said. Authorities identified the men as Phillip Hill, 45, from Neath; and Charles Breslin, 62, David Powell, 50, and Garry Jenkins, 39, all from the Swansea Valley. Searchers have recovered all of the bodies, police said. Three other miners escaped Thursday after water rushed into the area where the men were working, apparently after they broke through to a neighboring abandoned mine, Rescue Officer Andrew Watson said. One of the surviving miners was hospitalized. His condition was not immediately known. First Minister Carwyn Jones, who leads the Welsh government, paid tribute to the efforts of rescue workers and families of the miners before the discovery of the fourth was announced. ""My thoughts and deepest sympathies are with all of the families as this horrifying news filters through,"" he said. ""The people of Wales, and indeed people across the world stand together in solidarity with the families through this terrible tragedy."" The British government will carry out a full investigation into the incident, Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said in a statement released Friday. As of June 2011, 1,500 people in Wales worked in the mining industry. according to government figures. In a drift mine like the one where the men were trapped, coal is excavated from the side of a hill using shafts that are almost horizontal.

1404,"Manzanillo, Mexico (CNN) -- The storm recently known as Jova has dissipated over western Mexico, but its rains and flooding were responsible for at least six deaths, officials said. In the Mexican state of Colima, one person was swept away in a car by rushing water on the highway, state civil protection spokesman Luis Enrique Venegas told CNN. Three others in Colima were reported missing, he said. ""The main problem for us is damage to roads, bridges and streets. Infrastructure was severely affected by this hurricane and it's going to take a while to get back to normal,"" he said ""We're trying to reopen roads as soon as possible."" Jova struck Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane late Tuesday, packing winds of more than 100 miles per hour. It weakened into a tropical storm and then a tropical depression as it moved over western Mexico Wednesday. In Jalisco state, civil protection authorities said that they found a body after a mudslide, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. A total of five people have died in Jalisco, the agency reported. The bodies were found as the focus Thursday shifted to cleanup along Mexico's Pacific coast, while the floodwaters from Jova recede. Some residents took to rooftops in the resort town of Manzanillo, one of the hardest-hit areas, as a normally small stream turned into a raging river. Water was waist-deep in some areas on Wednesday. At least 1,400 people were in shelters, police said. ""The roads are all flooded. Bridges are about to fall down. Cars can't get through anywhere. People's homes are destroyed,"" Manzanillo resident Seth Berkowitz said. ""What came through here has really been a terrible disaster for everybody."" Floodwaters rushed into many homes in low-lying areas of Manzanillo. Resident Roberto Robles lost most of his furniture and spent Wednesday dealing with massive amounts of mud inside his home. ""We were really afraid, especially for the children, who still don't understand what a hurricane is,"" he said. Javier Velasquez said mud ruined his refrigerator when his kitchen filled with water in the early morning hours. ""Only God knows why something like this happens,"" he said. ""They had warned us, but we thought they were crying wolf.""","NEW: In the aftermath of Jova, six deaths are reported .

1405,"(CNN) -- Nearly six months after an explosion aboard an oil rig sent crude spewing from a BP-owned well deep below the Gulf of Mexico, cleanup work along the Gulf Coast is far from over. Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft, federal on-scene coordinator for the Deepwater Horizon spill, said Wednesday that operations in some areas won't stop once winter hits. ""I envision there will be some areas where cleanup will go on through winter, although there will be others that will close down within a matter of weeks,"" Zukunft said. Shoreline cleanup assessment teams still have yet to analyze 557 miles of oil-affected beaches and declare them clean. In the meantime, Zukunft said, oil spill response teams will be in place to clean up any residual oil as necessary. ""What we have during this spill, this was 87 consecutive days of a major spill, reoccurring, day in and day out. During that phase, we were in a crisis. Now [crews are] along the traditional lines, dealing with last release of oil and whether that impacted, time-consuming, labor-intensive process,"" he said. Seafood testing continues to be a priority, according to Zukunft. Christine Patrick, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service, said out of more than 2,700 seafood samples that went through rigorous sensory and chemical testing, none have come up positive for the presence of oil or dispersants. ""No samples have been taken from opened fishing areas that haven't passed those tests,"" Patrick said. As for the search for existing oil still within the Gulf of Mexico, NOAA scientist Sam Walker said Wednesday there is an ""aggressive program"" of work being conducted both offshore, near-shore and within the water to locate hydrocarbons. Walker said more than 31,000 samples have been tested and are in the process of being analyzed for evidence of dispersants or oil contamination, and that the results should be released in the next few weeks. Although it's been nearly three months since oil has last been released into the Gulf, Zukunft said the effects of the disaster remain substantial. ""If you look at what a traditional oil spill has been, you know this is anything but that,"" he said. ""What's different about this is now we have oil that's in a very deep water column."" Zukunft said even though the highest concentrations of oil detected in the water column is in the parts per billion, the Gulf of Mexico seafood industry is suffering from an unfair stigma attached to its product. ""As I've said, and will continue to say time and again, it is the most sampled seafood anywhere on the face of the Earth,"" the rear admiral said. ""The science, and I've seen it on a first-hand basis, is thorough, it's comprehensive, and so those are some of the hardships that the Gulf of Mexico residents are trying to recover from right now, especially those who make their livelihood harvesting seafood, and then dealing with the image of that.""","Federal officials say work will continue through the winter in some Gulf areas .

A bomb left 270 people dead when it exploded aboard the Boeing 747 as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland, less than a week before Christmas day in 1988.

A permanent memorial at New York's Syracuse University was dedicated to the victims. Read Brian Flynn's essay . Flynn says he's been in contact with other victims' families, who likely shared a range of emotions upon hearing news of Gadhafi's death. ""We're all together on this,"" he said of the families. ""This is one of those situations that when (John Patrick Flynn) died, I said I promised him and myself that I wouldn't let it go, that there would be justice,"" he told CNN. ""Today is an example that after 22 years, finally justice is done. I owed him that."" He says he felt ""the Libyan people have helped me fulfill my promise to him."" ""We commend and admire the courage of the Libyans, knowing that their freedom has come at a cost,"" Flynn added. ""It's taken great courage also on the part of the Obama administration to lead the NATO forces against challenging political and diplomatic circumstances,"" he said. U.S. and European war planes began a military campaign against Libyan government forces in March of this year in support of the country's rebels, helping to eventually oust the longtime strongman in August after more than four decades of near-absolute rule. Gadhafi's death an answer to little girl's prayer . ""Part of me thinks this story had to end this way,"" Flynn added, referring to the former Libyan leader's being killed rather than captured. ""Although it's sometimes hard to celebrate when someone gets killed brutally,"" he said, ""I think in this case there's every cause for celebration. ""He was an unrepentant murderer who was oppressive of his people."" Two years earlier, the only convicted Lockerbie plotter, Abdelbeset al-Megrahi, was freed from a Scotland prison after serving eight years of a life sentence. He was set free on compassionate grounds because he was battling prostate cancer. Al-Megrahi received a hero's welcome upon his return to Tripoli, enraging many in the United States and Britain. But a Libyan envoy said the new government is not likely to send him back. That country's ambassador to the United States cited al-Megrahi's poor health as a factor, saying he is a ""very sick man"" and is ""living with oxygen beside his bed."" At the time of his release, doctors had said he had only months to live, but al-Megrahi was still alive -- albeit visibly frail -- as of a few weeks ago. So when news reports surfaced Thursday of Gadhafi's death, Flynn said he took a moment and thought that ""it's worth it, to get justice."" U.S. President Barack Obama announced later Thursday that ""today we can definitely say the Gadhafi regime has come to an end."" Speaking during a White House press conference, he said the United States is committed to Libya and will support the country's democratic transition. ""You have won your revolution,"" he added, addressing the Libyan people. For others, Gadhafi's killing also likely marks an end to more than two decades of documenting the Lockerbie tragedy. Two years after the 1988 bombing, Syracuse University Archivist Amy S. Doherty said she contacted the families of the school's slain students, offering the archives as a place for families to donate ""correspondence, journals, diaries, photographs, newspaper clippings, examples of creative work, video and audio tapes by or about their child or about the events following the disaster."" The first collection from a victim arrived in September 1990, according to a university statement. Since then, materials relating to all 35 students have been added. In 2006, the scope of the archives was expanded to include items pertaining to all 270 victims.","NEW: Obama tells Libyans ""You have won your revolution""

1408,"(CNN) -- They spent 69 days in the bowels of the earth, 700 meters deep, not knowing if they would survive. For 17 days after the mine in which they were working collapsed, nobody even knew if they were alive. Friday marks the one-year observance of the fateful incident in Chile that trapped 33 miners who were saved in a miraculous rescue that made headlines around the world. Fame came after the rescue, which faded quicker in their country than abroad, and since then they have traveled to several destinations all-expenses-paid, though many report having money problems. Four of the miners will observe the anniversary of the event that changed their lives in Washington where an exhibit in their honor is being opened at the Smithsonian Institution. Mario Sepulveda, one of the miners attending, reflected on the historical significance of the event. ""In spite of our painful experience, it is very important to us that what is being exhibited will show the world what happened,"" Sepulveda said. He was the second to be rescued from the mine. Since they were rescued last October, the miners have traveled the world. Edison Pena, the miner whose underground workouts in the darkness garnered attention, ran the New York Marathon less than a month after being rescued. Pena also appeared on ""The Late Show with Dave Letterman"" on CBS where he impersonated his idol, Elvis Presley. Then, in January, he was invited as a guest of honor to the Graceland Mansion, in Memphis, Tennessee. Pena had dreamed of visiting the mansion since he became an Elvis fan as a teenager. In January, the entire group of 33 was honored at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. While there, they served as honorary Grand Marshals of Disney's Main Street U.S.A parade. They spent a full week in Orlando enjoying the attractions. But at home in Chile celebrity has not been what they expected, according to one of the miners, Jorge Galleguillos. The good will from their country faded fast, he said. ""They love us more abroad. They congratulate us, they want to touch us and get a blessing from us. That's not the case in Chile. Only a few greet us with affection; many more say hi with envy,"" Galleguillos said. A movie about the miners' ordeal is in the works. According to the Hollywood Reporter, producer Mike Medavoy (""Shutter Island"", ""Black Swan"") has snapped up the right to the story and Jose Rivera (""Motorcycle Diaries"") has been enlisted to adapt the screenplay. But at home, relations with the Chilean government are strained. Thirty-one of the 33 miners filed a lawsuit accusing the agency that oversees mining of failing to ensure safety measures. Carlos Barrios, the 13th miner rescued, says they're not targeting President Sebastian Pinera. ""We're not suing the current president. This has been happening for a long time. This happened during the administrations of other presidents. Why didn't they take a closer look [at the situation]?"" Barrios asked. Hernan de Solminihac, the Chilean mining minister, said his government respects the miners' right to sue. ""As any Chilean citizen, the miners have the freedom and the right to file any lawsuit they wish. They have chosen to do so and our judicial authorities are evaluating the suit,"" he said. The miners are seeking the equivalent of $16 million in damages for the collapse of the mine where they were trapped last year in the Chilean Atacama desert. They say their lawsuit isn't about the money, but about raising awareness about the working conditions for miners in their country, which they say, has been neglected for a long time.","Friday is the one-year anniversary of the Chile mine collapse .

1409,"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Residents of Thailand's Munag Ake village are being urged to evacuate the area early Tuesday morning, according to Thailand's Flood Relief Operations Center. The center's director said parts of a dike at Tambon Lak Hok, MuangÂ District,Â PathumÂ Thani province have broken and a mass of water is expected to flow into the village. Flood waters could reach almost five feet (1.5 meters) in the village. The FROC said the Royal Thai Armed Forces will have vehicles at Rangsit University in Munag Ake village and will be moving residents out of the area. In addition, the Thai Cabinet announced Tuesday public holidays for the end of the month due to anticipated high tides, which could further devastate the flood-ravaged country. The holidays will be from Thursday to next Monday and will be effective in 21 provinces that are still under water, including Bangkok and its suburban provinces, a government spokeswoman said. ""The government would like to give time to people in affected areas to prepare for floods during high tide periods between (October) 28 to 30. Some people who have houses outside Bangkok could be able to live there during flood period,"" said Thitima Chaiseang, the government spokeswoman. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra urged employers in both the private and public sectors to allow time off for staff affected by the floods. In addition to allowing time off, Thailand's Public Health Minister Wittaya Buranasiri has ordered health units be established to help ease the stress of residents. He said there are about 100,000 people suffering from stress related to the flooding. Also, starting Tuesday, the CEO of Nok Air announced the airline is canceling flights in and out of Bangkok's Don Muang Airport until October 31 due to the ""flood crisis."" . Pate Sarasin, CEO of Nok Air, posted a Twitter message saying ""the water level is now at a critical area at the northern part of the runway."" Nok Air is allowing customers to change their flights free of charge. On Monday, floodwaters in Bangkok reached Don Muang Airport, one of the Thai capital's two main airports and home to the flood relief operation command, according to a governor. In addition to Don Muang, residents in five other areas should prepare for floods, move their belongings to upper floors and take shelter at evacuation centers, Governor Sukhumbhand Paribatra said in a news conference on Monday. Thammasat University's gymnasium, which has been used as an evacuation center, is also flooded and without electricity and is itself being evacuated, the governor added. As a remedy, about 4,000 people will be bused to Rajamangala Stadium in central Bangkok with the help of 300 to 400 volunteers, according to the governor. In the east, the industrial estates of Lat Krabang and Bang Chan remained under threat, and volunteers were sought for help with sandbagging. The governor urged the public not to panic and to follow his reports closely. Protecting Bangkok was a priority because it comprises the economic heart of Thailand, Prime Minister Yingluck told CNN Sunday. ""But it doesn't mean we have no concern for the people who are suffering from the flooding,"" she added. The decision to divert water through canals in Bangkok means parts of the city and its surrounding suburbs, such as Rangsit, are flooded. Residents have resorted to moving out of flooded homes by boat or anything that could float -- or wading through water with plastic bags of belongings balanced on their heads or pets tucked into clothes. The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said some areas might require more than a month before waters recede. More high tides are expected in the coming week, which could cause rivers to back up, further raising water levels, according to Thailand's Flood Relief Operations Command. The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide, and more than 113,000 people have taken refuge. Many residents waded through dirty water in the capital in recent days, as they made a desperate attempt to save their belongings. The flooding has already killed 356 people, with nearly 9 million others affected, authorities said. Overall damage from the floods has risen and could top $6 billion, with the worst yet to come as the waters destroy shops and paralyze factories nationwide, the Thai Finance Ministry said. Thailand derives a significant portion of its revenue from tourism, which has been hurt by the flooding. CNN's Kocha Olarn and Karen Smith contributed to this report.","Residents of Munag Ake village are being urged to evacuate after parts of an area dike broke .

1410,"Baghdad (CNN) -- A series of bomb attacks throughout Iraq left 35 people dead and scores injured, officials with Iraq's Interior Ministry and police said Sunday. At least 28 people were killed in a suicide bombing attack in a Sunni mosque in the Ghazaliya neighborhood in western Baghdad late Sunday, an Interior Ministry official said. At least 37 others were wounded in the attack. A Sunni member of Parliament, Khalid al-Fahdawi, was among the dead. In Tarmiyah, about 40 kilometers north of Baghdad, two people were killed and five were wounded after a bomb exploded near a Sunni mosque as worshippers finished up a nightly prayer for the celebrations of Ramadan, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. Also Sunday, an bomb explosion killed two people in the Baghdad's Shiite-majority neighborhood of Jadriya, the spokesman said. In Mosul, six roadside bombs exploded in the town's center, wounding five police officers and two civilians. Also, on the highway that connects Mosul to Syria, a roadside bomb exploded on an Iraqi army convoy, leaving two wounded. In a separate incident, one man was killed after being attacked by gunmen. Two people were killed in Fallujah, officials said. Some of the attacks appeared to target policemen, the spokesman said. According to intelligence analysts with SITE, the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) vowed to step up attacks in the country to avenge the death of Osama bin Laden. In a jihadist forum intercepted by intelligence officials on August 19, ISI leaders said they would conduct several phases of its ""Plan of the Good Harvest"" campaign, SITE reported, one of which would take place during the holy month of Ramadan. However, previous attacks against Sunnis have been associated with Shiite militias, Iraqi analysts say. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and journalist Muhaiman Mohammed contributed to this report.","At least 28 die in a suicide attack on a Sunni mosque; victims include a member of Parliament .

1412,"(CNN) -- At least six people have died and several others are missing after rains triggered severe flooding in northern Italy, state-run news agency ANSA reported. Heavy rains continued to fall Thursday night in Milan and other spots across the southern European nation, according to the Servizio Meteorologico, Italy's official weather agency. That includes an alert from the agency about intense, widespread rainfall -- potentially with strong wind gusts and hail -- in the regions of Calabria and Basilicata, as well as the eastern part of Sicily. Meanwhile, Monterosso al Mare -- between Genoa and Pisa on Italy's northwest coast, in the Cinque Terre region of Liguria -- has been ""isolated, accessible only by sea"" because of earlier rains and floods, Mayor Angelo Betta told ANSA. So, too, is the nearby town of Vernazza, with even bulldozers and cranes still not able to reach it. That said, Betta reported some progress Thursday thanks to round-the-clock efforts by emergency workers and volunteers to clean up the town. One volunteer in that community died in the flood Wednesday. ""The situation is much better compared to yesterday,"" Betta said. Italy's defense ministry noted Thursday on its website that 348 military personnel have deployed to the provinces of Massa Carrara and La Spezia to assist in the wake of flooding here. Three people were killed after a house collapsed in La Spezia, the news agency stated. ANSA also reported that prosecutors have opened a manslaughter investigation related to the deaths of two people from flood-related injuries in Aulla. Authorities are assessing whether their deaths had anything to do with faulty work that may have caused the Magra River to overflow. The weather has also caused major travel headaches throughout the region. A mudslide that trapped a truck driver, who was eventually freed, has caused the A12 highway in Liguria to be blocked since Tuesday. Train service in Liguria has been halted, too, due to mud and debris on the tracks.

1413,"(CNN) -- Flooding has claimed 102 lives in southwestern Nigeria, where a dam burst and a river overflowed near the city of Ibadan, officials said Wednesday. A rain deluge from Friday night to early Saturday caused the Odo Ona River to overflow and the Eleyele dam to collapse, said Yushau Shuaib of the government's National Emergency Management Agency. Several homes were swept away and temporary camps were set up, Shuaib said. The Nigerian Red Cross, which is helping in the crisis, said earlier this week that more victims could still be found in remote areas that rescue teams have not reached. The government is delivering aid to people displaced by the flooding in Ibadan and surrounding areas in Oyo state, the National Emergency Management Agency said. Thousands of people have been displaced, and about 1,500 of them are being looked after in centers run by government officials and the Red Cross in the Ibadan area, Red Cross spokesman Umar Mairiga told CNN on Tuesday. They are being given emergency food rations, as well as mattresses, blankets and rubber mats, Mairiga said. The deputy governor of Oyo state, Chief Moses Adeyemo, called for more federal government help to resettle those displaced and to rebuild bridges and water channels destroyed by the flooding, the statement said. NEMA warned that there could be more flooding in urban areas during the rainy season if drains were inadequate or blocked by uncleared waste.

1414,"(CNN) -- Laura Pollan, a founder of one of Cuba's leading dissident groups, died Friday, her daughter said. Pollan suffered a heart attack and died at Calixto Garcia Hospital in Havana, Laura Maria Pollan told CNN en Espanol. The founder of Cuba's Ladies in White had been hospitalized several days ago because of a respiratory complication. Yoani Sanchez, a Cuban blogger, told CNN that some of Pollan's relatives, friends and fellow dissidents had gathered outside of the hospital. The Ladies in White, an opposition group, formed after the Cuban government cracked down on dissidents in 2003. Among the activists arrested then was Hector Maseda Gutierrez, Pollan's husband. He was freed in February. Members of the Ladies in White dress in white, carry flowers and march to demand the release of political prisoners -- many of whom are relatives and friends of the women.

1415,"Atlanta (CNN) -- The number of deaths linked to a listeria outbreak in cantaloupe has risen to 29, the Centers for Disease Control reported Wednesday, topping a 1985 mark for the most deaths among adults and children. The outbreak, first detected in September and traced back to a Colorado farm, has sickened a total of 139 people in 28 states, the CDC says. In addition to the 29 deaths, one woman who was pregnant at the time she fell ill suffered a miscarriage. The toll makes the current outbreak the deadliest among adults and children since the agency started keeping track of listeria cases in 1973, though a 1985 outbreak in California involved 28 deaths and another 20 stillbirths and miscarriages, CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said, according to CDC figures. What you need to know about Listeria . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it is unable to pinpoint the reason for the outbreak, but unsanitary conditions in a packing facility in the Granada, Colorado, farm is a suspected contributing cause. The agency notified Jensen Farms in October that likely causes included packing equipment that ""was not easily cleaned and sanitized"" and the use of washing and drying equipment for cantaloupe packing as well as other raw agricultural commodities. How to keep your food safe . In addition, the agency said in a statement, the facility lacked a ""pre-cooling step"" to remove field heat from the cantaloupes before cold storage, possibly leading to condensation in the cooling process that promoted growth of the listeria bacteria.

1416,"New York (CNN) -- JetBlue has begun refunding the passengers of five flights who were stranded on the tarmac of a Connecticut airport for as long as eight hours on Saturday, a spokeswoman for the airline told CNN on Thursday. Alison Croyle, spokeswoman for the airline, said refunds are currently being issued to passengers on all five planes that remained on the tarmac of Bradley International Airport near Hartford, amid the severe snowstorm that hit the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. ""Yes, we started issuing refunds, but it will take us a while to get everyone,"" she said. She said the passengers were given a letter on Saturday notifying them of full refund for their trip and a roundtrip voucher for future trips, customer service was also told to call each customer and apologize. CNN Senior U.N. Correspondent Richard Roth, who was stuck for eight hours on the tarmac aboard JetBlue Flight 504, said he had received a ticket price refund of $161.86. That flight was bound for Newark, New Jersey, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, but was diverted due to the weather. In a video posed Tuesday on the airline's blog and YouTube channel, Chief Operating Officer Rob Maruster apologized for a ""confluence of events"" that led to the incident, which he explained as ""various runway, congestion and other operational issues at Newark and JFK Airports."" However, Maruster said, ""at no point in this weekend was safety ever compromised."" ""But let's face it, you count on us at JetBlue for a lot more -- and we promise a lot more -- and we know we let some of you down over the course of this weekend and for that we are truly sorry."" Maruster said the airline intends to ""fully participate with the Department of Transportation and cooperating with their investigation into events over the weekend, and we're also going to conduct an internal evaluation so that we can learn from this event because at the end of the day, you deserve better -- and we expect better from our crew members and our operation."" During the eight-hour ordeal aboard Flight 504, there was little food or water, passengers were fighting, and some had medical issues . ""I got a problem here on the airplane. I'm going to need to have the cops onboard,"" a flight crew member told the tower in a conversation posted on LiveATC.net, a website that monitors air traffic control conversations. ""I need some air stairs brought over here and the cops brought onboard the airplane."" Passenger Roseann Kozma explained the situation in a phone interview with CNN affiliate WTIC from the plane. ""A couple passengers are fighting and there's a baby on here that's been crying the whole time,"" she said.

1418,"(CNN) -- The head of an embattled Connecticut power company defended his utility's response to a freak fall snowstorm that -- six days after it hit -- continues to leave hundreds of thousands without electricity. As of Friday night, about 283,000 households who get service through Connecticut Light and Power remained in the dark. The utility, which at one point had 831,000 such outages, has promised to return power to 99% of its customers by Sunday night. ""I believe CL&P has done a very good job,"" Jeffrey Butler, utility president and CEO, said Friday evening. ""This storm is of historic proportions... Have you ever seen an event like this?"" Butler made his remarks a day after Connecticut's attorney general called for regulators to investigate CL&P, the state's main electric utility, over its handling of the storm. Attorney General George Jepsen filed the request with the state's Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, which is already investigating CL&P over its response to power outages during Tropical Storm Irene in September. Eight people have died in Connecticut due to the storm, four of them from carbon monoxide poisoning, Gov. Dannel Malloy has said. He told reporters Friday that there have been a total of 322 carbon monoxide cases statewide. While saying he ""sure hopes"" he can trust Connecticut Light and Power, Malloy acknowledged that there were definite problems that must be addressed before the winter storm season begins in earnest. To this end, the governor announced Friday that Witt Associates -- a consulting firm led by former FEMA Director James Lee Witt -- will ""do a review of Connecticut Light and Power and UI (the United Illuminating Company) in the wake of their performance."" The review will be done at no expense to the state and be completed by December 1, before a different panel probing similar storm-related issues completes its own report. ""(We are) bringing in outside expertise to take an immediate look,"" Malloy said. ""I can't wait for the two-storm commission to make recommendations because we have winter staring us in the face."" The governor, specifically, said one area of focus will likely be the amount of tree branches that threaten power lines, adding that residents may have to sacrifice foliage for safety and energy security. ""What we have learned ... is that we are a vulnerable state to different types of weather conditions -- wind and snow are clearly two of those,"" said Malloy. ""And I think we can do better, in the long run, to prepare ourselves."" Eighty shelters were open around Connecticut on Friday night, in addition to 109 warming centers. The governor said that food and water had been delivered to residents of 82 towns, with more goods set to be delivered upon request. Butler, the Connecticut utility chief, said that the effort to restore power is in full swing. While acknowledging there may be ""opportunities"" for improvement, he blamed the weather conditions -- including as much as 20 inches of heavy wet snow in spots -- as the primary reason for the prolonged outages. ""Everyone I talked to, they've never seen anything like this,"" said Butler, who came to Connecticut after 27 years at Pacific Gas and Electric Company. ""The destruction of the trees was unbelievable."" He said that between 5,000 and 6,000 workers were on the job working to cut back trees and restore power, committed to the Sunday night goal. The late October storm killed at least 22 people around the eastern United States. That includes six deaths in Massachusetts, not including a seventh under investigation, said Peter William Judge, public information officer for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, on Thursday. In New Jersey, eight storm-related fatalities were tallied, including three people who burned to death in house fires, one person who died when a branch fell on him, another who died when a tree fell on him, and three people who died in motor vehicle accidents. A ninth death was under investigation.

1419,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan invoked his country's recovery from World War II on Tuesday as he sought to turn the nation's attention to the arduous task of rebuilding. Yet the challenges awaiting Japan remained on full display the day he spoke: The country rated the crisis at a nuclear plant stricken after last month's earthquake and tsunami as the most severe on an international system for rating nuclear accidents. And a fresh round of earthquakes rumbled across an already battered landscape. One with a magnitude of 6.3 was the latest of 52 quakes with a magnitude of 6 or greater since a monster 9.0 quake rocked the country and spawned a tsunami, leaving nearly 28,0000 people dead or missing. The prime minister noted that he was born in 1946, a year after the end of World War II, and that his family used an unexploded bomb to help stabilize a pickling tub in their home. He said the Japanese people ""stood up bravely and achieved a reconstruction that amazed the world"" after the war. ""We must renew the determination that we had in the post-World War II reconstruction period, and we must tackle the task of reconstruction after this earthquake,"" he said. The devastation left behind by the March 11 earthquake is an opportunity to build ""a new, better future than before,"" said the prime minister. He spoke at a news conference that had been originally scheduled to take place Monday but was delayed because of a series of aftershocks that rattled northern Japan. In one of the lastest developments following the wave of aftershocks, the Iwaki Fire Department said the death toll from landslides set off by a 6.6-magnitude quake on Monday had risen to six. Iwaki is located about 100 miles (164 kilometers) northeast of Tokyo and about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southwest of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The landslides in Iwaki buried three houses.","The Japanese prime minister urged Japan to focus on rebuilding .

1420,"New York (CNN) -- A 60-year-old woman on Sunday became the third person to die as a result of a helicopter crash last month in New York's East River, said a spokeswoman for the city's medical examiner's office. Harriet Nicholson was pronounced dead at approximately 3:22 a.m. Sunday at Bellevue Hospital, said Ellen Borakove from the office of the chief medical examiner. After an autopsy, officials determined that she died due to ""respiratory complications of near-drowning,"" according to Borakove. Nicholson was among those on board a Bell 206 Jet Ranger that plunged into the water on October 4, moments after pilot Paul Dudley had radioed that his aircraft was experiencing problems, National Transportation Safety Board member Mark Rosekind said last month. Authorities initially said that one woman -- Sonia Marra of Sydney, Australia, who died on her 40th birthday -- was the only fatality, with four others reported injured. Marra was trapped in the craft's back seat as it sank, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. Helen Tamaki, 43, died the following week. A source close to the investigation identified Harriet and Paul Nicholson, one of now two survivors, as Marra's mother and stepfather. Tamaki was a family friend, according to the source. The pilot, Dudley, is the other survivor. A 15-member team from the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash, which happened shortly after takeoff from a riverside helipad. U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who represents Manhattan's East Side in Congress, said in a previous statement that she was ""saddened and deeply concerned"" about the crash. ""There have been at least 28 helicopter crashes in our city over the last three decades,"" she said. ""Federal transportation officials should investigate not only the causes of this crash, but also whether it is safe to have such a high volume of helicopter traffic over our densely populated city.""","Harriet Nicholson, 60, dies at a New York hospital, a city spokeswoman says .

1421,"(CNN) -- A German organization involved in establishing and maintaining the Indonesian tsunami warning system denies widespread reports that the system failed to detect the tsunami that devastated parts of the Mentawai Islands on Monday. In particular the organization refuted news articles claiming the warning system had been vandalized and was not functioning. ""Contrary to reports stating otherwise, all components of the tsunami early warning system worked properly,"" the German Indonesian Tsunami Early Warning System said in a statement. ""Reports of broken or even deliberately destroyed system units are entirely unfounded,"" it added. The statement continued:  ""The detection of the causative earthquake by the seismic network was almost in real time, the corresponding operational image showed relevant warning levels in particular for the western coastline of the Mentawai Islands. The measurement of the tsunami at gauging stations on the islands and along the coast of Sumatra was accurate."" Meanwhile, the Indonesian state news agency ANTARA, quoting officials in the affected area, reported the latest toll was at least 370 dead, with 334 people still missing and some 486 houses destroyed.

1422,"(CNN) -- Launched in 1995, the Airbus A330-200 is the newest member of the European aircraft manufacturer's twinjet family. The incident involves an Air France Airbus A330-200. With a range of 12,500 km (6,750 nautical miles) and the capacity to carry 253 passengers, the A330-200 is extremely well-regarded as a medium to long-range airliner. There are 600 currently in service with 82 airlines, including Air France, worldwide. Airbus has a further 300 orders for the aircraft. According to aviation expert Kieran Daly, the A330-200 is a ""reliable, ultra-modern, state-of-the-art airplane,"" with an impeccable safety record. He told CNN that there has only been one reported incident when an aircraft of this type has crashed. ""The incident took place in 1994 before the aircraft came into service,"" he said. ""It was being flown in test-mode by pilots who were putting it through some extreme maneuvers before it came down. ""Therefore the crash was not caused by the plane itself. ""It is very well-designed and well-equipped, with equally modern and reliable General Electric CF-6 engines."" Air France has said that Flight AF 447 sent an automatic signal indicating electrical problems while going through strong turbulence early in its 11-hour flight from Rio de Janeiro to Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.  Why it took so long to report the aircraft missing » . However, Daly said that it would take extremely violent weather conditions to cause the catastrophic failure of an aircraft of this size. ""These planes are extremely robust and widely used on transatlantic routes and across Asia,"" he said. ""They are equipped with an array of sophisticated communication equipment, so it must have been something extremely sudden to cause the loss of contact."" There has also been speculation that the Paris-bound flight was struck by lightning, but that should not bring down a modern airliner, former Airbus pilot John Wiley told CNN. According to Air France, the captain of Flight AF 447 had a record of 11,000 flight hours and had already flown 1,700 hours on Airbus A330/A340 aircraft. Of the two first officers, one had flown 3,000 flight hours (800 of which on the Airbus A330/A340) and the other 6,600 (2,600 on the Airbus A330/A340). The aircraft had totaled 18,870 flight hours and went into service on 18 April 2005. Its last maintenance check in the hangar took place on 16 April 2009. The larger A330-300 aircraft from Airbus entered service in 1993 and has a capacity of up to 335 passengers. It too has an impressive safety record, despite a couple of incidents in the last 10 years. In August 2001, a Canadian airliner operated by Air Transat experienced double engine failure while traveling to Portugal. Miraculously the captain was able to perform an emergency landing in the Azores by gliding the powerless plane for almost 18 minutes. Last year, an A330-303 was forced to make an emergency landing in Australia after a sudden change in altitude injured 74 passengers. Qantas Flight 72 was flying from Singapore to the western Australian city of Perth when a sudden change of altitude caused abrasions, contusions, fractures and other injuries.

1423,"(CNN) -- At least 17 employees at the Idaho National Laboratory were exposed Tuesday to what the lab described as low-level radiation from plutonium. The workers underwent initial decontamination at the facility where the incident happened and were then transported to an on-site medial center for evaluation, the lab said in a statement. There is no evidence of a leak outside the facility and there is no risk to the public or environment, it added. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL), located in eastern Idaho, is a U.S. Department of Energy nuclear research site. Tuesday's incident happened within the lab's materials and fuels complex, which has facilities for remotely handling, processing and examining spent nuclear fuel, irradiated materials and radioactive wastes, according to the INL's website. The workers were inside the decommissioned Zero Power Physics Reactor (ZPPR) when a container was opened for scheduled work, ""resulting in low-level worker exposure to plutonium,"" the lab said. The ZPPR was a low-power test reactor that evaluated various design features.","The exposure happened at the Idaho National Laboratory .

1424,"MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN)  -- A roadside bombing in Somalia's capital killed 21 women who were cleaning rubbish from a southern Mogadishu street on Sunday morning, a hospital official said. Mogadishu residents gather around victims of the bomb attack along the city's Maka Al Mukarama Road. The bomb blast wounded another 46 people, most of them Somali women who had gathered to clean Maka Al Mukarama Road in southern Mogadishu's Kilometer 4 district, according to Medina Hospital director Dr. Dahir Dhere. ""It suddenly turned the area into a carnage, scattering body parts of the street cleaners into a large area,"" said witness Asha Ise Gedi. ""There were pools of blood everywhere. I have never seen such mass killing."" ""They were innocent poor mothers or sisters,"" Gedi said. ""Why did they deserve this?"" It is unclear who is behind the attack. Mogadishu Mayor Mohamed Omar Habeb Mohamed Dhere, who was recently fired by the country's prime minister, blamed the Islamic Courts Union for waging the attack. But the head of the Islamist insurgent group, Abid Rahim Ise Adow, denied any involvement and blamed Somalia's government for orchestrating the attack. The victims were participating in a program that allows Somali women to work as street cleaners in exchange for food. The United Nations' World Food Program organized the program, which began last year and is administered by Mogadishu's regional authority. Mogadishu has been the site of violence in recent months between Ethiopian troops and Islamist fighters. Somalia's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital, with the help of the better-equipped Ethiopian forces. On Saturday, two-thirds of the Somali government ministers announced their resignations, blaming Prime Minister Nur Hassan Nur Ade's ""dictatorship,"" which they said included his firing of Mogadishu's mayor. Nur Ade said he suspects the mass resignations were aimed at weakening implementation of the peace agreement between Somalia's transitional government and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. He said he had no plans to resign. The peace agreement, signed June 9 in Djibouti, calls for a cease-fire between Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia, an opposition group that includes members of the Islamist Court Union which overthrew the government in 2006. The ICU was ousted from power later that year by Ethiopian forces, with the support of Somalia's transitional government. If followed, the peace deal would pave the way for a withdrawal of Ethiopian troops -- a major sticking point for Islamist fighters who oppose their presence. The agreement calls on the alliance to dissociate itself from armed groups still fighting the government and for all sides to allow ""unhindered humanitarian access and assistance"" to all Somalis. A joint committee led by U.N. officials will monitor the agreement's implementation. Ethiopian forces became embroiled in an Islamist insurgency after the Ethiopian forces invaded Somalia in December 2006 to overthrow the ICU leaders and reinstall the transitional government. As guerrilla attacks mounted, efforts to replace the Ethiopians with an African Union-led peacekeeping mission faltered. Ethiopia's invasion had the blessing of Somalia's government and the United States, which accused the ICU of harboring fugitives from the al Qaeda terrorist movement. The conflict displaced hundreds of thousands of Somalis, further worsening a humanitarian crisis that dates back to the collapse of the country's last government in 1991. The situation has been exacerbated by drought, continual armed conflicts in central and southern Somalia, and high inflation on food and fuel prices. CNN's Alan Duke and journalists Mohamed Amin Adow and Abdi Nasir Mohamed contributed to this report.","NEW: Mayor blames Islamist fighters for blast; Islamist fighters blame government .

1425,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Deaths in Zimbabwe related to the cholera epidemic are approaching 2,000, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, and close to 40,000 people have been affected by the preventable water-borne disease. Two men rest in a cholera rehydration tent on the South Africa-Zimbabwe border in December. Statistics released by the Geneva, Switzerland-based organization WHO on Tuesday show 1,937 people have died in the raging epidemic from the 38,334 who contracted the disease since its outbreak in August. Cholera has spread to neighboring countries South Africa and Botswana. The epidemic comes at a time when President Robert Mugabe's government is facing its worst economic crisis, manifested in shortages of all essentials from food, fuel, cash, foreign currency and electricity and a hyperinflationary economy. Health experts have said Harare's failure to import adequate stocks of water-treating chemicals is the main driver of the disease. Most residents have resorted to rivers and shallow wells for drinking water, because taps are usually dry. On top of that problem, the waste-disposing system has collapsed. Children can be seen playing on heaps of uncollected garbage in the suburbs of most urban areas in Zimbabwe. Last month, Mugabe's government declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency. Since then, international governments and organizations such as WHO, Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam, USAID and other U.N. groups have moved in to combat the disease that has engulfed all of Zimbabwe's provinces. But the situation has not immediately improved. Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned this month that the epidemic could get worse as the rainy season develops. Harare issued a warning Monday that some parts of the country are going to experience floods during rainy season, further compounding the fight against the disease. The season peaks in January or February and ends in late March. Mugabe and rival Morgan Tsvangirai signed a power-sharing deal in September to run the government after a hotly contested presidential election. It was widely hoped that the deal would be the panacea to the humanitarian and economic problems bewildering the once-prosperous Zimbabwe, but the pact is yet to take effect. The sides continue to debate the sharing of key Cabinet ministries such as information, local government, finance, defense and home affairs.","World Health Organization says 1,937 people have died since outbreak in August .

1426,"(CNN) -- Friends and family of Jean and Scott Adam -- avid sailors killed by pirates while on a round-the-world boating adventure -- mourned their losses Wednesday and tried to make sense of the tragedy. The Adams, along with fellow sailors Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle, were found shot to death after U.S. forces boarded their hijacked vessel around 1 a.m. Tuesday, U.S. officials said. The 58-foot yacht, named the Quest, was being shadowed by the military after pirates took the ship off the coast of Oman on Friday. The forces responded after a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at a U.S. Navy ship about 600 yards away -- and missed -- and the sound of gunfire could be heard on board the Quest, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mark Fox told reporters. ""Despite immediate steps to provide life-saving care, all four hostages ultimately died of their wounds,"" U.S. Central Command said. ""We're trying to deal with the grief of the loss,"" Clayton Schmit, a friend of the Adams, told CNN. ""We've been praying earnestly over the weekend, and (since) we had the news that thing went bad, we've all been deeply in mourning."" Schmit, a Lutheran minister, is a professor at Fuller Theological Seminary in California, where Scott Adam taught as a graduate student. The Adams were from Marina del Rey, California. Macay and Riggle were from Seattle. The killings took place as negotiations involving the FBI were under way for the hostages' release, Fox said. Two pirates had boarded a U.S. Navy ship Monday for the negotiations, he said. He told reporters he had no information on details of the negotiations or whether a ransom had been offered. Two pirates were found dead on board the Quest, he said. In the process of clearing the vessel, U.S. forces killed two others, one with a knife, Fox said. Thirteen others were captured and detained along with the other two already on board the U.S. Navy ship. Nineteen pirates were involved altogether, he said. Fox said authorities believe the pirates were trying to get the vessel and hostages to Somalia, or at least into Somali territorial waters. He added that it was the deadliest pirate hijacking involving U.S. citizens that he could recall. There have been fewer than 10 fatalities associated with pirate activity in the region in the past few years, he said. The 15 detained pirates were being held together on a U.S. warship, Fox said, and ""we will go through the appropriate process to bring them to a judicial process and hold them accountable for their activities."" Piracy has flourished recently off the coast of Somalia, which has not had an effective government for two decades. While piracy in the Indian Ocean has taken place for years close to the Somali coast, ""in 2008 we saw a very marked and rapid shift into the Gulf of Aden, where Somali pirates were attacking and hijacking vessels very, very regularly,"" said Cyrus Mody, manager at the International Maritime Bureau in London. International navies combating piracy have been fairly successful in setting up a patrolled transit corridor through the Gulf of Aden, Mody and Fox said. But the pirates' activities then shifted into the southern Red Sea, Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea area, Mody said. Over 50 pirate attacks have already taken place in 2011. As of February 15, pirates were holding 33 vessels and 712 hostages. Schmit told CNN that the Adams were aware of the growing danger of piracy in the Indian Ocean, particularly near the Horn of Africa, where the Quest was located at the time of the attack. While sailing around the world, the Adams were delivering Bibles to hospitals and schools in dangerous locations, Schmit said. ""It was their mission in life and nothing was going to deter Scott."" ""There are many places in the world where Christian missionaries are facing the possibility of capture and torture and death,"" Schmit added. ""Most of the people who embark on those kinds of missions are well aware of (the dangers). They're surrounded by prayer and uplifted by their friends and family. ... If they feel called, they typically go."" Schmit said the Adams didn't feel comfortable arming themselves while in dangerous waters. Scott Adams had noted, among other things, that ""if you take a firearm on board and you stop at certain ports, your boat can be confiscated along with your cargo, so he didn't want to risk that."" The Adams, Macay and Riggle had been traveling with yachts participating in the Blue Water Rally since their departure from Phuket, Thailand, rally organizers said Sunday on the event's website. The group, which organizes long-distance group cruises, said the Quest broke off on February 15 after leaving Mumbai, India, to take a different route. ""We're all speculating"" as to why the Quest broke away from the other boats, Schmit said. ""Somehow they slipped through the hole in the safety net.""

1427,"Concepcion, Chile (CNN)  -- We couldn't have traveled farther to see the same thing. We were returning to the United States from Haiti -- where every turn continues to unveil another human tragedy even six weeks after the January 12 earthquake -- when we were redirected to Chile. An 8.8-magnitude quake had struck the area around Chile's capital, a seismic event 800 times more powerful than the one in Haiti. Getting there was half the story. We took off from Miami, Florida, knowing the airport in Santiago was closed, so our aim was to get as close as we could. That set off a journey that would last 48 hours. We flew to Panama, Lima, Sao Paolo, Buenos Aires and Bariloche, then began a very long drive through the Patagonia region of Argentina, into Chile and north into the earthquake zone. We were followed by an enormous full moon and skimpy clouds that danced along the skyline. This region seems too lovely to be the scene of any tragedy. Its tall green mountains peaked with whitecaps and broad lakes give way to fields and sparkly beaches. South America had summer vacation until it was interrupted by this disaster. And it is, in a word, a disaster. Haiti, with its death toll and great suffering, sets the bar very high right now for what you can call a tragedy. But there is nothing inconsequential about hundreds of people dying, crushed in their own homes or swept away by a frantic sea. Chile has had very powerful earthquakes before and is a modern and wealthy place compared with Haiti. But as we drove up through Ozoro, Las Violetas, Los Angeles and other lovely farming towns, we saw chunks of roadway and roofs fallen away, fractured bridges, people camped in tents among their cows. Every Chilean we spoke to talked about how the previous earthquakes had pushed anyone with means to rebuild their homes or find new ones designed to withstand strong shaking. People here know what to do. But the sight of military convoys and ambulances told the story of what 8.8 can do. An ambulance driver in Los Angeles said there had been dozens of aftershocks, many powerful enough to add to the rising toll of injured and dead in towns without many large structures. They were overwhelmed and being dispatched to Concepcion, where a large population and tall structures meant more severe injuries. There, we found looting and people walking the streets in search of water and gas. The largest buildings were missing entire walls, and glass had shorn off the sides. A light cold drizzle was getting everyone wet. The vacation period means a lot of young people are out being mochileros (backpackers) and are separated from families by distance and downed phone lines. They have heard the stories of beach towns swept away and houses upended and are hitching rides at gas stations, hoping to find a way to reunite. The aftershocks are like a rising tide here, a clear sign that this is not over, that the damage is not done. The farm stands and cottages of the back roads are crooked and empty; the city centers look abandoned and on the brink. This country is not crying out for international assistance in the way Haiti did. It was prepared and has coping resources. This is a place that sends rescue workers to other countries because they're so good at it. Yet its natural beauty and efficiency are not enough to diminish what connects these folks to Haiti -- that the people waiting for buses beside the blackberry fields along Panamericana Ruta 5 are running scared.","The quake that shook Chile was 800 times more powerful than the one that hit Haiti .

1428,"(CNN) -- Chile is unfortunately no stranger to earthquakes. A quake similar to Saturday's struck almost exactly the same part of Chile on February 20, 1835 -- almost exactly 175 years ago. On that occasion, the young English naturalist and geologist Charles Darwin was in Chile as part of his voyage on HMS Beagle. The 1835 earthquake has been estimated as magnitude 8.5, whereas that of February 27, 2010, has been measured as 8.8. The earthquake of 1835 occurred around 11 a.m. and lasted about two minutes. The main shock destroyed much of Concepción in just six seconds. There were aftershocks for several weeks and three tsunamis, each one larger than the last, starting about half an hour after the earthquake and bringing further devastation. Darwin was on shore near Valdivia, 200 miles south of Concepción, during the quake and recorded in his diary: . ""I was on shore & lying down in the wood to rest myself. It came on suddenly & lasted two minutes (but appeared much longer). The rocking was most sensible; the undulation appeared both to me & my servant to travel from due East. There was no difficulty in standing upright; but the motion made me giddy.  I can compare it to skating on very thin ice or to the motion of a ship in a little cross ripple. ... An earthquake like this at once destroys the oldest associations; the world, the very emblem of all that is solid, moves beneath our feet like a crust over a fluid; one second of time conveys to the mind a strange idea of insecurity, which hours of reflection would never create."" The Beagle, with Darwin aboard, reached Concepción on March 4. The devastation there was appalling. Darwin called it ""the most awful yet interesting spectacle I ever beheld."" The entire city lay in ruins. The cathedral was shattered and wreckage and debris lined the coast. Darwin spent the next weeks investigating the effects of the earthquake. He found that rocks lined with recent marine shells were now elevated above the tide. The island of Santa Maria was raised an average of about 3 meters (9 feet). Combining his own observations with those of many local people, Darwin attempted to reconstruct the event and to understand why it had occurred. He found that three volcanoes had erupted along the Chilean coast at about the same time as the earthquake. Not only did he collect widespread evidence of the uplift of the coast during the earthquake, but traveling inland and into the mountains, he discovered a series of remains of marine shells -- proof that the shifting that had recently uplifted the coast by a small amount had occurred over and over in the recent geological past. The experience convinced him that the great geologist Charles Lyell was right -- mountain chains were not created by sudden immense catastrophes, but grew almost imperceptibly, the product of thousands of successive uplifts over almost endless geological time. Even more ambitiously, Darwin later came to connect earthquakes, volcanoes and vertical movements of the Earth's crust as the results of same great unknown subterranean phenomena. In an ambitious and important scientific paper published after the voyage, Darwin concluded that ""this large portion of the earth's crust floats in a like manner on a sea of molten rock"" and indeed that it was likely this was true of ""the entire globe."" This firsthand appreciation of an ever-changing surface of the Earth, over endless eons of time, was one of the major influences leading Darwin to ask how it was that living things changed in order to adapt to an ever-changing world. His answer was, of course, evolution, or that new species are the genealogical descendants of earlier ones, adapted according to natural selection to the environment and each other. The recent tragic earthquake in Chile demonstrates, as Darwin knew well, that our Earth is not static, it is still changing, still evolving. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John van Wyhe.","Saturday's earthquake was similar to one that struck Chile when Darwin visited .

1429,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- With at least five people dead and massive expanses of land and roads under water, Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency Monday in the 17 counties hardest hit by flooding from severe weather. Atlanta firefighter Stephen Webb carries a dog to safety Monday at the Peachtree Park Apartments. Gov. Sonny Perdue's announcement followed three deaths in north Georgia's Douglas County, one death in Gwinnett County and another in Carroll County, where a 2-year-old child was ripped from her father's arms by fierce floodwaters while he struggled to hold on to bushes, officials said. Those counties, near Atlanta, were among the 17 included in the state-of-emergency declaration . About 100 miles north of Atlanta, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, one person was swept into rushing water and is presumed drowned, said Jeremy Heidt, a spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency in Nashville. Three missing children in Douglas County, west of Atlanta, were found, but their mother was one of the flood's fatalities, said Dena Brummer, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. ""We're in rescue-and-recovery mode,"" said Wes Tallon, spokesman for fire and emergency management services in Douglas County. ""It has not stopped raining, and another line of thunderstorms is coming.""  Watch flooding one CNN.com staffer recorded » . Until just a few months ago, the area was gripped by drought.  Watch what caused the torrential rain » . Several storms moving northeast from the Gulf of Mexico brought the downpours, which forecasters expected to continue through Monday night. Rains were expected to taper off by Tuesday morning but scattered showers were expected for the next couple of days. Just west of Atlanta, some areas have received about 22 inches of rain since last week, CNN meteorologists reported. About 12 of those inches fell in a 12-hour period from Sunday night to Monday morning. After Georgia creeks and rivers burst, swollen by days of rain, residents struggled to escape. In Cobb County's Austell, two rescuers paddled their way through rising flood waters searching for stranded victims, video from CNN affiliate WXIA showed. The pair on the inflatable, yellow raft ushered a stranded woman to a section of black-tarred street that was not under water. Nearby, three men pushed their valuables in a kayak as they waded through the shoulder-high muddy waters. Another two men floated on what looked like air mattresses linked together by rope.   Watch men float on inflatable mattresses » . Near Marietta northwest of Atlanta, a flooded bridge blocked the only road out of a residential area surrounded by a national park and the Chattahoochee River. Two buses picked up elementary school children Monday morning, but flooding prevented them from picking up older students later, and the buses couldn't return with the first batch in the afternoon, said iReporter Pritam Jaipuriar, who lives there. See Pritam Jaipuriar's iReport . Some elementary students used a walking trail -- the only other path out of the area -- to return home. Some parents arranged for friends beyond the bridge to pick their children up from school and keep them for the day. ""My first-grader son is staying with a friend of mine,"" said Jaipuriar, who was unable to go to work Monday. Some ground-level apartments in the area were flooded, but his unit was fine, he said. Unable to drive for supplies, some residents walked the path to a store a few miles away and returned with bags of groceries, said iReporter Jeff Cofer, who also lives there. See Jeff Cofer's iReport . Near northwest Atlanta's Vinings area, floodwaters encroached upon multimillion-dollar houses. Rescue personnel rode in boats over flooded streets Monday night, going home to home to pick up residents and take them away. Water levels were high enough at one home that the people there stood on a roof to await rescuers, a fire and rescue official said. On Monday morning, a couple inches of water had entered the Villa Rica, Georgia, home of iReporter Walid Zeid, damaging suitcases and other things that were on the floor. Water from a flooded lake lifted his boat to the roof of his boathouse, crushing the boat's canopy, Zeid's iReport video showed. Zeid, a flight attendant, was supposed to be on an international flight Monday, but flooding prevented him and his family from leaving home, which is in Carroll County. See Walid Zeid's iReport . ""You can't go anywhere. The roads are washed up,"" he said. The flooding from torrential rains drenching the metropolitan Atlanta area ""has to rank as one of the worst,"" Matt Sena of the Peachtree City, Georgia, National Weather Service told CNN.

Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport in five days has received about 4.5 inches more rain than it usually would in all of September, he said. iReport.com: Floodwaters seep into Carroll County home . ""Hundreds of roads have been closed"" in the Atlanta area, Brummer said, adding that Carroll, Douglas and Paulding counties ""have been impacted the most.""  Watch I-75/85 under water » . Two of the Georgia fatalities involved people trying to drive through floodwater. A vehicle with one man in it was swept off a road in Douglas County, and a car carrying a woman was swept off a road in Lawrenceville in Gwinnett County, east of Atlanta, Brummer said. Seydi Burciaga, 39, was driving to her Lawrenceville home from work when flash flooding trapped her in her vehicle, Gwinnett County police said. She called 911 and police tried to locate her, but Burciaga could not tell them exactly where she was. Floodwater moved her car about 500 feet after she was swept off the roadway, and her attempts to guide rescuers to her by mentioning landmarks were unsuccessful, police said. By the time rescuers found her minivan, she was dead, police said. In Tennessee, the presumed drowning victim was forced into a culvert, or underground storm water drain, about 6 p.m. Sunday, Chattanooga Fire Department spokesman Bruce Garner told CNN. Sylvester Kitchens Jr., 46, was with a friend, Albert Miller, when the two decided to swim in a large, flooded ditch, Garner said. He said a Miller family member told him that ""basically it was a bet."" Both managed to grab onto a chain link fence while being buffeted by the strong current, Garner said. A neighbor threw a garden hose for them to grab onto, and Kitchens reached for it but was unable to hold on. Miller clung to the fence for about 20 minutes and was eventually rescued by firefighters, Garner said. Kitchens' body has not been found, said Garner, who added that it ""doesn't appear he could've survived.""

1430,"(CNN) -- A volcano near southwest Colombia's border with Ecuador erupted on Saturday, leading the government to issue a ""red alert"" for the region. The Galeras volcano is shown on January 17, 2008, from Pasto, Colombia. There were not believed to be any fatalities or injuries in the blast, which happened at about 7:10 p.m. ET (12:10 a.m. Sunday GMT), said Carlos Lineras of the Colombia Institute for Geology and Mines. The institute issued an evacuation order for about 7,000 people living near the Galeras volcano. The volcano is not in a heavily populated region. Galeras has erupted several times since it became active again in 1989. The only fatalities were in 1993, when nine people -- all scientists or tourists in or near the volcano's crater -- were killed.","No deaths, injuries feared from eruption, authority says .

1431,"(CNN) -- Golfers preparing for The Barclays FedEx Cup playoff event at Plainfield Country Club in New Jersey found themselves not only battling the course, but also the effects of a 5.8 magnitude earthquake which struck Virginia on Tuesday. The quake forced the closure of a nuclear power plant and was felt from as far afield as Georgia and New England, while also causing many PGA Tour players to post their reactions on the social-networking site Twitter. American world number 15 Bubba Watson used his @bubbawatson account to tweet: ""This house we rented just shook!"" Watson's compatriot Jason Dufner, who finished tied for 5th at the recent PGA Championship, also tweeted his shock after feeling the tremors: ""Earthquake in Jersey? Or someone trying to give me a shake down??"" Virginia earthquake rattles the East Coast . The 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson was clearly concerned by the quake, in which no major injuries were reported, and tweeted: ""Well. Just went through my first earthquake. Gotta believe it wasn't a big one here in NJ. But, it freaked me out. #kneesbuckled."" Briton Justin Rose has been on the PGA Tour since 2003 and was on the driving range when he felt the quake. ""Was that an earthquake I just felt on the range in New Jersey!!"" read his tweet. ""Either that or Gary Woodland is thumping out 2 irons on range!!"" Woodland, a 27-year-old one-time winner on the Tour, posted: ""Earthquake in jersey. Thought a kid was shaking my chair. Crazy."" The FedEx Cup playoffs are now in their fifth year and serve as a season-ending championship for the Tour, with The Barclays set to get under way on Thursday. A field of 125 players have qualified for The Barclays based on points accumulated over the course of the year. Out of those 125, the top 75 will advance to the Deutsche Bank tournament in Boston, before the field is cut to 70 for the BMW Championship in Illinois -- which will begin on September 15. Finally, 30 players will head to Atlanta for the final tournament, due to start on September 22, where the FedEx Cup champion will be crowned.","Golfers at The Barclays in Virginia reacted to Tuesday's earthquake on Twitter .

1432,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Insurgents apparently tied to al Qaeda attacked a checkpoint in western Baghdad and killed five police officers early Tuesday, officials said. In the eastern city of Kut, meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed and 50 wounded when a bomb in a parked car exploded at a busy outdoor market, according to officials at the interior ministry. Health ministry officials, however, said three people died and 62 were wounded in the Kut bombing. Two other car bombs were defused by Iraqi security forces about half an hour after the first explosion, interior officials said. Such attacks have been uncommon in Kut, the provincial capital of the predominantly Shiite province of Wasit. The gunmen in Baghdad, who police officials said used pistols equipped with silencers, left behind a black flag, which is used to represent the Islamic State of Iraq. The umbrella group includes a number of Sunni extremist organizations and has ties to al Qaeda in Iraq. The same flag was left behind by insurgents after they attacked several security checkpoints and killed at least 16 people in a neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad last week. The Islamic State of Iraq also claimed responsibility for last week's suicide attack on a television station in Iraq that killed at least six people and wounded 20. Police officials said another officer was wounded Tuesday after a bomb attached to his vehicle exploded in the Hurriya district in northwestern Baghdad. Two bystanders also were injured, police said. Separately, three roadside bombs exploded in two neighborhoods in the Iraqi capital Tuesday, wounding six people. Also, two mortar rounds landed in the Mansour district in western Baghdad, damaging a building, and two more mortar rounds struck Baghdad's international zone Tuesday. Overall, violence in Iraq has dropped drastically over the past two years compared with the height of the sectarian war in 2006 and 2007, but bloodshed continues. The country is at a critical period as U.S. officials continue with plans to end America's combat mission and draw down troops to reach 50,000 by the end of August. According to the security agreement between the United States and Iraq, all American forces are scheduled to leave the country by the end of next year.

1433,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- UK businesses, already hurting from a recession, were counting the cost Monday of the country's worst snowstorm in almost two decades, as a crippled transport system left commuters stranded, offices semi-deserted and airlines grounded. Pedestrians cross the Thames in front of St Paul's Cathedral in London's financial district. At least 20 percent of the workforce nationwide, or 6.4 million employees, failed to make it into work Monday morning, according to an estimate by the Federation of Small Businesses. But the figure was estimated to be far higher -- around 40 percent -- in London and southeast England, which is home to around a fifth of all British businesses. FSB spokesman Stephen Alambritis told CNN the cost of Monday's disruptions would likely reach £1.2 billion ($1.7 billion). With further snowfalls forecasted for Tuesday and Wednesday, that figure was likely to rise, he warned . ""It's pretty bad out there and throughout the whole of the UK,"" Alambritis said. ""The blow to the economy should be lightened by the fact that people can work via internet and laptops. But what we are seeing is economic activity reduced, contracts not being signed, invoices not being sent out and meetings being canceled."" Douglas McWilliams, Chief Executive of the Centre for Economics and Business Research warned that up to 3,000 businesses could go bankrupt as a result of short-term cashflow problems caused by the weather. ""Many of the businesses that are close to failing are in the retail and construction sectors that are likely to be most affected by the snow and transport disruption,"" McWilliams said in a statement. Alambritis said that the disruption would also damage the UK's reputation as a place to do business and called for the government and local authorities to invest in infrastructural improvements to cope with freak weather. ""It gives the UK a bad name if there's a bit of snow and the whole economy grounds to a halt,"" he said. ""Why is it that in Canada, New Zealand and Scandinavia they have these snowfalls and everything carries on?"" In the City, financial markets were running at 50 percent capacity in early trading with just 120 million shares changing hands by 0910 GMT, according to David Buik of BGC Partners. But a spokesman for the London Stock Exchange told CNN later that trading had not been too badly affected, with most trading automated at the big firms. Airlines were expected to be particularly badly hit with hundreds of flights canceled or severely delayed from airports in the southeast as Heathrow and Stansted were forced to shutdown runways. Budget airline Ryanair, which operates out of Stansted, canceled more than 100 flights and said stranded passengers could book a new flight free of charge. But some businesses were enjoying an unexpected boost from the chaos. With bus and rail links down across London, taxi firms were reporting surging demand. Keith Cain, the control room manager for Dial-a-Cab, the city's biggest taxi company, said the firm had been receiving more than 5,000 calls an hour, mostly from companies trying to get their employees to their desks. Hotels near Heathrow Airport also reported being overwhelmed by stranded passengers seeking rooms for the night.","UK crippled by heavy snow; economic cost estimated to reach $1.7 billion .

1434,"Van, Turkey (CNN) -- The death toll from Wednesday's 5.6-magnitude earthquake in eastern Turkey has risen to 40, the government said Sunday. A much deadlier 7.2 magnitude quake that tore through Van last month left 604 people dead, officials said. Twenty-six people have been rescued as a result of Wednesday's quake. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the Van region Saturday, as a heavy snowstorm hampered rescue efforts. The sleet, snow and plunging temperatures also worsened conditions for hundreds of thousands of earthquake survivors living outdoors. Freezing temperatures were expected to continue Sunday, with a bit of warming ahead Monday and Tuesday. ""It's not possible for us to survive the winter here. The Van winter is very cold and there's a lot of snow. Living in these shelters is impossible,"" Cezmi Fazla said. He stood outside a small hut his family constructed out of Styrofoam and plywood. The hut was on the road outside Fazla's house, which was still standing but badly damaged after the earthquakes. Ten to 15 family members slept in the hut every night, including his wife and youngest child, as well as his father and brother. Fazla said he sent his three oldest children to relatives in the western Turkish city of Izmir after the first earthquake . ""We haven't gotten any aid,"" he said. ""We got a lot of support from the people of Turkey, packages with everything from clothes to toothpaste. But the elected officials, the nongovernmental organizations are not making good use of it and were not good at coordinating those efforts. So people feel very panicked. That's made a lot of people uncomfortable."" Frustration from earthquake survivors is palpable on the streets of Van, where almost all of the shops are closed after the earthquakes. ""I condemn Tayyip Erdogan,"" yelled Muhsin Tarhan, referring to Turkey's prime minister. He was walking down the street with his wife and six children looking to scavenge plastic and wood to build a shelter. ""We have been buried in the rain, and snow and cold and Recep Tayyip Erdogan does nothing. He only helps those who are supporters of his political party."" There is a deep distrust of the Turkish state among many of Van's ethnic Kurdish residents. In interviews with CNN, many residents even challenged the government's 5.6 magnitude rating of Wednesday's earthquake, claiming it was secretly downgraded, even though the U.S. Geological Survey reported an identical 5.6 magnitude. Southeastern Turkey lies along turbulent geological and ethnic fault lines. For decades, the region has been the main battlefield of a long-running guerrilla war between Kurdish separatist rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and Turkish security forces. On Thursday, tensions boiled over just yards from the rescue operation near the rubble of the Bayram Hotel, when a small crowd of protesters confronted Turkish government officials, demanding the resignation of the Van governor. Turkish riot police armed with clubs and shields later attacked the demonstrators. In remarks to journalists on Friday, Erdogan denounced the demonstrators, calling them saboteurs who were hampering the recovery effort. Journalists were assembled awaiting a press conference with the prime minister. But after Erdogan met with disaster relief officials for more than an hour, the press conference was canceled, without explanation. Two Turkish journalists were among the dead from Wednesday's quake. Sebahattin Yilmaz and Cem Emir with the DHA news agency had been covering the aftermath of the 7.2 magnitude quake. They were buried in the rubble of the five-story Bayram Hotel, which collapsed on Wednesday. A Japanese volunteer who had traveled to Turkey to assist with recovery operations was among other casualties of the demolished hotel.","26 people have been rescued from Wednesday's quake .

1435,"(CNN) -- A flag that was nearly destroyed in the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, was raised outside of the funeral service Thursday for 9-year-old Christina Green, who was born on that fateful day. The banner, which measures 20 feet high and 30 feet wide, was draped between the extended ladders of two fire trucks outside the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church in Tucson, Arizona, forming an arch under which Christina's family passed as they arrived ahead of the 1 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) service. John and Roxanna Green, Christina's parents; and her 11-year-old brother, Dallas, paused for a few moments to look up at the flag as it rippled against the clear blue sky. A few minutes later, more relatives emerged from the same black SUV limousine that brought her immediate family, also craning their necks to take in the huge banner. The young girl was killed Saturday when a gunman fired on a crowd at a congresswoman's meet-and-greet event in Tucson. Five others also died, and 13 -- including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona -- were wounded. The flag topped a building near the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York, and was heavily damaged by falling debris when the tower crumbled after hijacked airliners crashed into it and its twin. Many remember the images of the tattered banner, fluttering heroically above the debris and smoke in the days after the towers' collapse. Soon after, the shredded flag was removed and put in storage until 2008, when a member of the New York Says Thank You Foundation recovered it and took it to Greensburg, Kansas. Foundation volunteers were there to help residents of the small town complete some rebuilding projects more than a year after a strong tornado devastated the region. According to Jeff Parness, the founder and chairman of the foundation, it was a way to say ""thank you"" to some of the townspeople who had come to New York in the aftermath of the terror attacks to help there. According to the group's website, while foundation members worked to rebuild the town, residents began to repair what is now called the National 9/11 Flag by patching it with flags recovered from the tornado rubble. Since then, the banner has traveled across the country, gathering flags from other disasters that are stitched on by survivors and other groups. It even includes part of a flag upon which a dying Abraham Lincoln was laid, the foundation said. Parness said the idea to display the flag at Christina's funeral came to him when he heard an interview with her mother, Roxanna, who spoke about how her daughter always looked for the positives that came out of the 9/11 attacks. ""She would refer to her birthday as a holiday,"" Parness quoted Roxanna Green as saying. ""When I heard more about her sense of service and volunteerism and the community spirit, her love of government, we just realized we had to have this flag at Christina's funeral,"" he told CNN. Parness contacted the family's pastor, who conveyed the offer, and the Greens accepted. ""We both let out a gasp of emotion, because, you know, that meant a lot to us,"" Christina's father, John Green, told CNN. ""And for them to extend that courtesy to our daughter ... again, it's just another one of those things that will help for us. We feel like the country won't forget her."" Parness says the flag is really more of a symbol of 9/12, instead of 9/11. It shows ""what it looks like when Americans come together and help each other recover from tragedy and disaster,"" he explained. ""When you look at this beautiful flag, it shows what it's like when you connect all these people. We had a father on December 7 in Hawaii, Pearl Harbor Day, who stitched the flag in Pearl Harbor. He lost his son in Afghanistan,"" Parness said. He said newly naturalized citizens would help with the stitching on Friday at the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta, Georgia. ""It's about bringing people together and showing what's possible out of a tragedy like this."" Citing Christina's love of helping other people, Parness said ""kids get it."" ""They understand when people are in need, what can you do to help. After the funeral and as the community in Tucson and the country starts to heal after this, we're going to look back and say, what could we do, the simplest thing every day, to make Christina smile on us? Just to be kind to your neighbor, volunteer."" ""In a bizarre way, this is a tremendous gift that Christina is giving to us, to show the country this flag, to ... let people in local communities nominate service heroes to place a stitch in this flag so we can heal it and make this flag whole again by the 10-year anniversary"" this September, Parness said.

1437,"(CNN) -- The Wegmans supermarket chain is recalling 5,000 pounds of Turkish pine nuts because of possible salmonella contamination, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. At least 43 cases of salmonellosis in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia are linked to the pine nuts, the FDA said Friday, citing the Centers for Disease Control. The agency warned consumers not to eat the nuts, offered for sale in unlabeled plastic bulk containers at Wegmans stories, or any food items, such as pesto or salads, that have been made using them. The pine nuts were ingredients in several prepared foods sold at Wegmans, including Caprese salad and asparagus with pine nuts, the agency said. The pine nuts may be contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis, which may cause illness. They were sold in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia and Maryland, the FDA said. The salmonella bacteria can cause diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days, the FDA said. While most people recover without treatment, infection may lead to hospitalization and can be fatal. The bacteria is most dangerous to older adults, infants and those with compromised immune systems, the FDA said. Consumers are urged to check their homes for the nuts purchased at Wegmans stores between July 1 and October 18, and either throw them away or return them to Wegmans for a refund, the FDA said.

1438,"(CNN)  -- Rescuers have found the body of a man who was one of six people aboard a small airplane that crashed Sunday evening near the northern shore of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The Cessna 206 single-engine aircraft went down about a half mile off the coast of Quebradillas. The man's body was found Monday less than 150 feet from shore, Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad said. The Coast Guard launched two more search missions Tuesday morning for four men and one woman still missing. Authorities have not released their identities, nor the name of the man found Monday. ""The Coast Guard will continue to search as long as there is the possibility of finding any survivors,"" Castrodad said. Eighteen divers will conduct searches Tuesday in the area where the body was found, the Coast Guard spokesman said. Volunteer divers from Arecibo found the body Monday, said Jose Daniel Echeverria, spokesman for the Puerto Rico Emergency Management Agency, which also is involved in the search. As of Tuesday, the Coast Guard will have conducted 12 search operations, eight done by four HH-65 Dolphin helicopters from Air Station Borinquen and four by the Cutter Matinicus, Castrodad said. The search is complicated, he said, by the roughness of the area. ""It's like a cliff,"" he said. ""The surf is very rough. It's hard to get in that area."" Smaller boats from the emergency management agency and the Puerto Rico Police Joint Forces for Rapid Action are being used because they can reach areas that the Coast Guard cutter cannot, Castrodad said. The private plane, chartered by Tropical Aviation Corp., took off from the Dominican Republic and was on its way to an airport in Puerto Rico when it went down Sunday evening, officials said. The four males and one female onboard were returning to Puerto Rico after spending the weekend in the Dominican Republic, said Noemi Corporan, service manager for Tropical Aviation. The passengers were San Juan residents and had flown to the Dominican Republic on Friday, she said. The airplane took off from Casa de Campo International Airport in the Dominican Republic and was supposed to land at the Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in Carolina to clear U.S. customs before going on to the Isla Grande Airport in San Juan, the Coast Guard said. A 911 emergency operator notified the Coast Guard at 6:51 p.m. Sunday that an aircraft had crashed into the waters off Quebradillas. Searchers found a debris field in the area late Sunday. In the Dominican Republic, meanwhile, a man who said he spent the weekend with the missing passengers said he urged them not to leave Sunday night because of severe weather. Retired businessman Manuel ""Manolin"" Lecaroz, 64, told El Nuevo Dia newspaper that the group left because one of them had business to conduct Monday morning. He did not have a premonition, Lecaroz said. ""It's just that you can't fly when the weather is bad."" The winds and heavy rains that were still being felt in Puerto Rico on Monday had ruined the group's chances to spend the weekend fishing and playing golf in the Dominican Republic, which is 79 miles (127 kilometers) away. ""It rained every day,"" Lecaroz told the Puerto Rican newspaper. ""The wind was blowing very hard, so much that we couldn't go out in the boat any day."" As they left Sunday night, group members hugged Lecaroz and talked about returning later this month to fish and golf, he said.","Coast Guard launches search missions for five still missing after plane went down .

1439,"(CNN) -- Walt Hazzard, the dazzling point guard who led UCLA to its first NCAA basketball title and starred in high school, the NBA and the Olympics, died after a long illness, according to the UCLA Bruins' website. The 69-year-old Hazzard died Friday afternoon at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center surrounded by family and friends, according to a statement from his family. He had been recuperating from complications following heart surgery. ""This is a sad day for the UCLA basketball family,"" UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero said in a statement. ""Walt was the catalyst for coach John Wooden's first championship team and played the game with a style that excited Bruin basketball fans everywhere. He contributed to his alma mater in numerous ways, including as a student-athlete, coach and honored alum, and he will be greatly missed by all of us who knew him. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Jaleesa, and their four sons."" Hazzard starred at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia, where he led the school to an 89-3 record. He transferred to UCLA after the 1960-61 season at Santa Monica College and played for Wooden, a fabled coach who mentored excellent teams through the years. the sophomore Hazzard led the team to the Final Four in 1961-62 but it lost to Cincinnati. Two years later, as a senior, he led the Bruins to the NCAA championship in 1964, the first of many championships for what had become a college basketball dynasty. He earned All-America honors at UCLA as a junior and senior and piled up impressive scoring statistics there. He was chosen for the U.S. Olympic team in 1964 and helped the United States win a gold medal at the games in Tokyo. He later joined the NBA, playing with the Los Angeles Lakers and others teams -- Seattle, Atlanta, Buffalo and Golden State -- for a total of 10 seasons. He went into coaching and eventually became head coach for the Bruins for four years during the 1980s. Under Hazzard, the team won a National Invitation Tournament, a PAC-10 title and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament. After coaching, he scouted and consulted for the Lakers. He also got involved with the Young Black Scholars group and started a non-profit for middle school students, the Los Angeles Sports Academy. The 100 Black Men of Los Angeles Inc. in October gave Hazzard a Lifetime Achievement Award. ""He was a great player and an outstanding coach at UCLA. He is a huge part of the Bruin legacy, and he left life-long memories for the Bruin faithful,"" UCLA head men's basketball coach Ben Howland said.

1440,"(CNN) -- The world of fashion responded to Japan's March earthquake, like many other industries, with the desire to help its victims. Japanese clothing companies and fashion magazines mobilized charity campaigns and donated clothes to people in the stricken area. Lady Gaga even designed a special bracelet that raised over $250,000 for the relief effort. Personal shopping habits and even styles in Japan were also affected by the tragedy, but not necessarily in a negative way. ""It is not our impression that people refrained from buying or wearing colorful clothing (after the earthquake in March),"" said Mitsuko Watanabe, editor of Vogue Japan. ""On the contrary, some deliberately chose bright colors to retain a positive attitude and give themselves and others a lift,"" she added. In cities far from where the tsunami hit, the immediate period after saw fashion stores close their doors to shoppers, adverts pulled from public places and sales of luxury brands drop. However, by May sales for many luxury goods had risen above pre-disaster levels, according to Watanabe, especially for items that transcended fashion, namely engagement and wedding rings. ""In times of crisis, people gain a fresh appreciation of what is really important in their lives. ""These trends are a good indication of how people are seeking peace of mind, stability, and steadiness under the unsettling and uncertain circumstances,"" she said. For those who didn't get the urge to marry, simple retail therapy was another response to the disaster. According to a survey by Asian trend and innovation agency Five by Fifty, 58% of consumers in the big city areas of Osaka and Tokyo continued shopping for clothes and fashion as normal after the earthquake. Of the 40% of people surveyed who admitted to reining in their clothes shopping, the main reason was personal finance rather than self-restraint or a sense of solidarity with the victims in the Tohoku region. ""People did pull back somewhat immediately after (the disaster), but shopping didn't stop and they were buying items that were less obvious, like fragrances,"" said Nicole Fall, director of trends for Five by Fifty. ""The perfume market for Japan is traditionally small compared to Europe, but it spiked after the earthquake. It was something that could be enjoyed without being conspicuous or risk of being seen to come out of store carrying lots of shopping bags."" Japan's annual summer program of ""setsuden"" (energy-saving) was given extra significance this year with the nuclear crisis at Fukushima and reduced power supply. It also meant some fashion brands recast their marketing strategies. Fast fashion label Uniqlo brought out its ""Heattech"" line of insulating clothing at the end of July to tap into people's desire to cut back on heating bills and use less energy. Now, six months since the earthquake, big-city consumer habits are back to normal and representative of a larger trend, suggests Fall. ""People haven't deliberately made a stand (through their shopping habits). If anything the earthquake has just amplified the feelings before it, which were generally representative of post-consumerism. Young people often feel they can't afford things and people look for more from a purchase, as well as being savvy enough to look online."" Watanabe echoes the sentiment that Japanese consumers are more selective in their fashion purchases. ""If there was any change of this nature, it seems to lie ... in a stronger inclination to select articles they will continue to be fond of long into the future,"" she said. Watanabe also hopes that this year's ""Fashion's Night Out"" -- an evening of shopping and events on November 5 -- will give Japan's fashion industry a boost and reinforce the way the fashion can give back to the community. Vogue's editor in chief Anna Wintour and other regional editors of Vogue will attend as a show of solidarity. ""Fashion should make a more important contribution for social and economic good in what is a critical situation,"" said Watanabe.","Sales of wedding rings went up in Japan after the tsunami in March .

1441,"(CNN) -- A major clean-up operation is underway along the north coast of New Zealand 's North Island as debris and oil leaking from a cargo ship that ran aground on a reef wash ashore, officials say. The Rena, a Liberian-flagged vessel, struck the Astrolabe Reef, about 12 nautical miles off the city of Tauranga, last week. New Zealand's oil spill response agency, Maritime New Zealand (MNZ), estimates that as much as 300 tonnes of fuel oil has leaked from the vessel, which was carrying 1,700 cubic meters (450,000 gallons) of fuel. The country's environment minister, Nick Smith, has called the spill the country's most significant maritime environmental disaster. As of Wednesday, clean-up teams, comprised of some 500 responders, collected 50 tonnes of solid waste and five tonnes of liquid waste from beaches in the Bay of Plenty, cleaning oil from 17 kilometers of coastline, MNZ said. Pubic access to some waterfront areas has been restricted due to health concerns. MNZ said the coastline between the towns of Whangamata and Whakatane will be assessed today to determine the areas of highest priority for clean-up operations. ""There is a massive effort underway and it is only going to grow,"" said National On Scene Commander Nick Quinn. ""We understand the anger and disbelief we're hearing from people,"" he said. ""Our focus is on recovering oil from wherever we find it and we will go in day by day until this is over."" MNZ said that 200 dead birds have been recovered following the oil spill and that this number is expected to increase ""significantly."" The agency said 36 wildlife rescue teams are scouring the coast for wildlife affected by the spill and 47 oiled animals are being treated at center that has been set up in Tauranga. A team has been established to capture seals and five of the animals are being kept in captivity. Greenpeace has expressed ""extreme concern"" about the spill and urged the government to avoid using further toxic dispersants. ""This is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea,"" the organization's Steve Abel said. ""Even a slow and relatively accessible oil spill like this one has clearly stretched New Zealand's response capability to its limits,"" he said. ""It is also a potential disaster for the blue whales and dolphins presently calving in the area, as well as numerous other marine species."" MNZ said that about 70 containers had fallen off the ship, some of which have washed ashore. Due to the hazard the containers pose to shipping, the agency said navigational warnings had been issued and major maritime traffic has been re-routed. The Rena has suffered substantial structural failure and there is a concern that the stern of the vessel may break up, MNZ said. Salvage teams have three tugs mobilized either to hold the stern on the reef while efforts continue to remove oil from the ship, or to tow the stern to shallow water to extract the oil, the agency said. Containers remaining on the vessel continue to move, making it dangerous for salvage crews to work on board. The ship's second officer will appear in Tauranga District Court this morning to face a charge of ""operating a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk,"" MNZ said. The Rena's captain was yesterday remanded on bail on the same charge, on the condition he surrender his passport. His name has not been released. If convicted, they face a maximum fine of $7,800, or up to 12 months imprisonment. CNN's Karen Smith and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Teams have cleaned oil from 17 kilometers of coastline in Bay of Plenty .

1442,"Lome, Togo (CNN) -- Six members of the Etoile Filante soccer club died in a bus accident on Saturday in Togo and 25 people were injured, said a spokesman for the country's soccer federation. The team was headed to Sokode, where it was scheduled to play Sunday, when a tire reportedly burst, causing the bus to flip and catch fire, said Aime Ekpe, the spokesman. ""Twenty-five others, including some players, are severely injured. Most of the victims died in the fire,"" Ekpe said. He spoke to CNN from the scene of the accident in Glei, about 81 miles (130 km) north of Lome, Togo's capital. Among the victims were Christophe Dagbovi, the club's secretary-general, Isidore Kouma, the deputy coach, and Charles Balogou, a former national team goalkeeper. Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe issued a statement soon after the accident, offering condolences to the victims' families. Soccer in the West African country has suffered a series of misfortunes in recent years. Gunmen attacked a bus carrying Togo's national soccer team to a tournament in Angola in 2010, killing the team coach and the director of communications. A helicopter carrying 22 Togolese soccer officials, including Sports Minister Richard Attipoe, crashed in Sierra Leone in 2007. No one survived.","The victims were members of the Etoile Filante soccer club .

1443,"(CNN) -- Two sailors from a ship that capsized in the Irish Sea in gale-forced winds were rescued ""in reasonable condition"" Sunday while five remained missing, the British coast guard said. The body of an eighth sailor was recovered, the coast guard said. After a daylong search in rough seas, the British coast guard ended the effort to find the five missing men as darkness fell, according to a coast guard press officer. ""Today at roughly 16:45 GMT (11:45 a.m. ET), a decision was made by the coast guard to call off the search and rescue mission for the five remaining missing sailors in the Irish Sea,"" press officer Jo Groenenberg told CNN. A Ministry of Defence spokesman earlier confirmed to CNN that Prince William was the co-pilot of the helicopter that plucked the two rescued sailors from a life raft. The crew of the Swanland sent out a mayday call about 2 a.m. local time, saying the ship was caught in strong winds and had a cracked hull, the coast guard's press office said. A few ships responded, but the Swanland had capsized by the time they got there, the office said. The coast guard dispatched two helicopters, including one from RAF Valley base, where Prince William is a search-and-rescue pilot. The helicopter pulled two men from the water. A coast guard spokesman later said the two -- who included the ship's second officer -- were in ""reasonable condition"" after the helicopter had carried them to the military base.","The British coast guard calls off a search for five missing sailors .

1444,"New Orleans (CNN) -- Waging war against historic flooding in eight Midwestern and Southern states, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened a spillway north of New Orleans on Monday in an effort to calm the rising Mississippi River. A crowd gathered near the entrance to the Bonnet Carre spillway to watch workers use cranes to slide open the gates to the flood control system. The spillway, like another that could be opened next week, is designed to divert floodwater away from New Orleans and slow the raging river to protect the low-lying city. Bonnet Carre is part of a system built after the devastating Mississippi River flood of 1927. While the river's highest levels may still be days away, a decision to open the second flood control structure -- the Morganza Spillway -- may not be, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said. People with property that would flood if the spillway is opened should not dally, Jindal warned: ""My advice to our people is not to wait, to get prepared now."" The Bonnet Carre spillway diverts water from the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico by way of Lake Pontchartrain. But opening the Morganza Spillway would flood populated areas and could put Morgan City, Louisiana, and other communities at risk. Col. Ed Fleming, the Corps of Engineers' district commander in New Orleans, said he has requested the authority to open the Morganza Spillway. Jindal said the Louisiana National Guard had asked for at least three days, but preferably five days, to evacuate those areas before the Corps opens the gates. Upstream in Memphis, Tennessee, residents and authorities had prepared all they could Monday as they waited for the Mississippi to crest at a near-record 14 feet above flood stage Tuesday morning. ""It's sort of torturous,"" Memphis Mayor A.C. Wharton Jr. said. ""We've been waiting so long. It's hard keeping people's attention. It's warning fatigue, if you will. But we're ready for it."" The river level stood at 47.8 feet Monday evening and is expected to crest at 48 feet, said Ryan Husted, a forecaster for the National Weather Service in Memphis. President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration for the state of Tennessee Monday, which will help direct federal aid toward recovery efforts in areas hit by severe storms, flooding and tornadoes since early April. The Mississippi is the highest it's been at Memphis since 1937, when it crested at 48.7 feet -- 14.7 feet above flood stage. That flood killed 500 people and inundated 20 million acres of land, said Col. Vernie Reichling, the Corps' Memphis District commander. The river covered the lowest parts of the city's historic Beale Street and had forced about 400 people from their homes Monday, Wharton said. Another 1,300 remained in low-lying areas, he said. Corps officials said levees protecting the area appeared to be holding up well, with only minor amounts of water seeping in from beneath or lapping over from above. ""All of our levees were designed to withstand heights greater than what we're seeing today, although this height is significant,"" Cory Williams, chief of geotechnical engineering in the Memphis district with the Corps, told CNN affiliate WMC. ""The levees have held up very well in this event."" But local officials were taking no chances. ""It's a very powerful river. It looks like it's running very slowly, but it has a very strong current,"" said Bob Nations, director of preparedness in Shelby County, Tennessee, which includes Memphis. ""We still don't know (exactly what) the river might do."" Nicholas Pegues, an East Memphis resident who lives near the Wolf River, said he's seen extensive flooding and homes left uninhabitable by the water as he's traveled through the region. ""It's affecting daily life tremendously,"" said Pegues, a Shelby County elections' division employee who submitted photos of the flooding to CNN iReport. ""It is pretty severe downtown. ... I know a lot of ... people have lost their homes."" Wharton said the flooding had not yet caused major disruptions in the city, and he did not expect it to, even though National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Borghoff said it is possible the river won't fall below flood stage at Memphis until June. That's the problem in Missouri and southern Illinois, where flooding continues even though the Mississippi and Ohio river crests have moved south. In Murphysboro, Illinois, CNN iReporter Robert Icenogle said a swollen creek is inundating a church and bandshell while threatening to wash out telephone poles. ""We cannot get to the park, which is underwater, or to other towns,"" he said. ""Most of the roads are closed, plus the water sewage plant is getting sandbagged."" If a nearby sewer plant is forced to shut down, ""We won't have tap water to bathe in or drink,"" he added. Last week, the Corps intentionally breached a levee in Missouri as part of its effort to reduce the pressure on other levees, flooding 130,000 acres of agricultural land over the objection of state officials and some farmers. ""I'm very sad. I look at that and I don't have a home,"" Marilynn Nally said, pointing to her flooded family farm.  ""I feel like we're having to suffer for somebody else."" As the floodwaters worked their way south, the operator of a nuclear power plant in Port Gibson, Mississippi, expressed concerns that rising water could cut off an access road to the facility. However, there was no plan to shut down the Grand Gulf Nuclear Power Station and no immediate cause for concern, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Agency said Monday. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour told CNN's John King the greatest risk will likely be from flooding around the powerful river's tributaries, rather the Mississippi itself. ""Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst,"" he said. In Louisiana, where the river's crest is not expected to begin arriving until next week, Jindal added bears to the list of things residents need to think about. He said flooding could force some of the state's ursine residents from their homes and into populated areas. So far, 21 parishes have issued emergency declarations ahead of expected flooding, Jindal said. He said 400 National Guard troops would be active by the end of the day Monday helping prepare for the flood. Even with a forecast for record or near-record crests into next week and weeks of high water to follow, Corps officials say they expect nothing like the widespread and devastating flooding that occurred along the southernmost stretch of the Mississippi River in 1927. That flood began near Memphis in the fall of 1926 and did not end until the following August, according to the National Weather Service. It devastated the levee system, and flooded 165 million acres of land, sweeping 600,000 people from their homes. It came at a cost of 246 lives and the equivalent of nearly $624 million in 2011 dollars. As a result of that flood, the report says, Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1928, which led to a massive public works programs to build a system of levees and other structures designed to hold back the river more effectively. The latest flooding in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys is largely the byproduct of torrential rains throughout the region. Over one two-week stretch, there was about 600% more precipitation than usual, Reichling said. The weather now appears to be working in the flood fighters' favor. Only minimal rain is expected over the coming days, with daytime temperatures forecast to be in the upper 80s and 90s through Thursday, at which point the water levels should begin to creep back down. Still, a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency told HLN's Vinne Politan that people around the river and its tributaries need to be careful and should not wait until they see water to take action. ""It's going to be a tragedy on many levels. So many people are going to be displaced. They're going to be displaced for a long time and they may not have much of anything to come back to,"" said Jeff Rent. CNN's Greg Botelho, Marlena Baldacci, Phil Gast and Ben Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: ""It's going to be a tragedy on many levels,"" says Miss. emergency management spokesman .

1447,"Istanbul (CNN) -- The death toll from an earthquake that struck eastern Turkey a week ago was at 601 as of Sunday, the Turkish state-run Anatolia news agency reported. More than 4,100 people were injured in last Sunday's 7.2-magnitude quake, which struck Turkey's Van province. At least 455 people died in the town of Ercis, where rescue efforts have been under way throughout the week, a crisis center in Van province reported Saturday. However, some 231 people have been found alive in the rubble, despite temperatures nearing the freezing mark at night, Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay said Saturday, according to Anatolia. Two teenagers were pulled out of the rubble alive late Thursday and early Friday, more than 100 hours after the quake. Eighty-four buildings have collapsed in Ercis and six more in the city of Van, Atalay said. Relief crews have distributed 40,721 tents -- including 6,088 from abroad -- and 159,360 blankets to survivors, authorities said. A total of 1,309 aftershock quakes have occurred since Sunday's main temblor, officials said. Turkey's government plans to present a new law to parliament by the end of December which would see the evacuation of settlements in areas at high risk of natural disaster, Anatolia reported. Laws governing construction and property management would also be revised under the so-called Urban Transformation Law, the agency said. The United States and China are the latest countries to offer help to Turkey's quake survivors. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ordered the U.S. European Command to provide humanitarian relief supplies including blankets, cots, sleeping bags and hygiene kits, the Pentagon said Friday.","More than 4,100 people were injured in the quake last Sunday .

1448,"(CNN) -- All four of the children wounded in a mass shooting in east Texas have died, police confirmed Thursday. Lt. Andrew Lewis, a Bay City Police spokesman, said the deceased children were 2, 3, 4 and 5 years old. He did not identify them. The 2-year-old was a girl and the 4-year-old a boy, he said.

1449,"(CNN) -- Band members who were with Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion on the bus in a parking lot in Orlando, Florida, where he died last month tried frantically to get him help when they realized he was not breathing, a 911 tape released Thursday reveals. ""One of our drum majors is on the bus and not breathing,"" a male caller tells a female dispatcher for the Orange County Fire Rescue. ""Is he breathing or is he not breathing?"" she asks. ""We don't know if he's breathing or not, but we need to get an ambulance ASAP."" ""I have help on the way already,"" she says. She asks, ""Is he awake?"" ""He's not even responding. He's responding a little. He wasn't responding. We thought he was breathing. He was making noises, but I don't even know if he's breathing now."" ""Is he awake?"" ""His eyes are open; he's not responding."" ""But is he breathing?"" ""I have no idea. I cannot tell you. He just threw up."" ""He just threw up?"" ""Yes."" The dispatcher then asks whether Champion was shaking prior to stopping breathing. ""No, he wasn't. He wasn't shaking. I don't even know how he was. He was just sitting there. We were just talking and the next thing you know, he was shaking and not doing anything."" Asked again whether Champion was shaking, the caller -- who says he has left the bus in order to hear the dispatcher -- tells her, ""No, no, he wasn't shaking. He wasn't moving. I don't know what's going on."" The dispatcher then calmly asks him to get back on the bus. ""I want you to see if he's breathing, because that's very important,"" she says. After a silence, the voice of another man tells the dispatcher, ""Ma'am, we have a band member right here,"" he says. ""He's on the bus and he's not breathing."" He says, ""I tried to give him CPR and he started to vomit."" ""OK, and you're right by him now?"" she asks. ""He's in my hands, ma'am. He's cold. He's in my hands."" Asked to lay Champion flat on his back on the floor of the bus, the man says, ""OK, I'm going to try. He's heavy."" ""I understand,"" the dispatcher says. ""Just try to do your best, OK?"" ""All right."" After more silence, the conversation resumes. ""All right, cool. He's flat. He's flat on this back."" ""OK, then I want you to kneel next to him and I want you to look in his mouth for food or vomit."" ""Yes, there's vomit."" ""There is vomit in his mouth?"" ""Yes."" ""OK, then I want you to turn his head to the side and I want you to clean out his mouth and his nose."" At that, six minutes after the call started, the connection is lost. The dispatcher calls back and gets a recording: ""Sorry, you've reached me at a time of inconvenience."" Band director Julian E. White told CNN Atlanta affiliate WXIA that he was walking to dinner when he saw the police and paramedics show up pull into the parking lot. ""I followed them, and that's when I saw that Robert was laying on the bus and, obviously, having medical difficulty,"" he said. He said the drum major looked like he had passed out. ""At that point, my concern was getting the best medical attention that I could for Robert."" He accompanied Champion to Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. His death at age 26 occurred on November 19 after a football game that included a halftime performance by the Florida A&M Marching 100 band. Officials have said his death was related to hazing. The tape was made public Thursday as a school official confirmed that FAMU had dismissed four students. The dismissals were announced Tuesday in a letter from university President James Ammons to the board of trustees. Another 30 students were dismissed from the band, Ammons wrote. No reason was given. Florida Gov. Rick Scott called Thursday for a review of state universities' hazing and harassment policies. ""Hazing should be strictly condemned on our college and university campuses and by any organization associated directly or indirectly with our institutions,"" Scott said in a letter to the chancellor of the state university system. He asked Chancellor Frank Brogan to request that the state's 11 university presidents to ""remind students, faculty and staff of these policies and procedures and how potentially detrimental hazing can be."" No cause of death has been released. Champion's family has said it plans to sue the school ""to get answers."" Speakers at Champion's funeral in Decatur, Georgia, described him Wednesday as a kind person and a leader dedicated to achieving his goals. ""Robert gave us his all every time that he took the field. ... Whenever Robert heard the sound of the drum, his knees raised, his toes pointed and he was on a mission to make the FAMU community proud,"" said White, who began leading the 420-member FAMU band in 1998. Ammons moved to fire White shortly after Champion's death, citing ""alleged misconduct and/or incompetence involving confirmed reports and allegations of hazing with the Department of Music and the 'Marching 100.'"" White, who has hired an attorney to fight for his job, said he has zero tolerance for hazing, which he described as a national problem. ""This is a problem that we are going to have to address as a nation if we are going to save the youth of America,"" he said. Under Florida law, any death that occurs as the result of hazing is a third-degree felony. After the death, Ammons suspended all band performances and said he would convene a task force ""to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the Marching 100.""","NEW: Band director Julian E.

1450,"(CNN) -- In anticipation of more flooding next week, residents of Fargo, North Dakota, began stacking sandbags Wednesday for the second time in just over two weeks along the banks of the Red River. A trucker relaxes April 1 on sandbag pallets in Fargo, North Dakota,  which is preparing for more flooding. They hoped to fill 1 million, said Fargo spokeswoman Karena Lunday. ""If we get a million, that will be a total of 4 million we've made since the flood started,"" she said. The first sandbag effort began about March 23. The Red River crested at nearly 41 feet at Fargo on March 28, breaking a record that had held since 1897, when the Red River reached 40.1 feet. The National Weather Service issued a flood warning Tuesday, predicting that melting snow -- and possibly rain -- will start to raise river levels on the Red River south of Oslo, Minnesota, this week. Lunday said forecasters expected the river to crest there between April 16-18, possibly reaching 35 feet on April 14. ""I don't think people are as worried as they were the last time, but the possibility of getting up to 40 feet is a concern,"" Lunday told CNN. The Red River meanders along the border between North Dakota and Minnesota, so many other cities also were bracing for flooding.","Fargo spokeswoman says city has goal of filling 1 million more sandbags .

1451,"New York (CNN) -- Jeff Parness still remembers the pain of September 11, 2001, when his friend and business partner, Hagay Shefi, was among the thousands killed in the World Trade Center attacks. But Parness, a native New Yorker, also hasn't forgotten the support that his hometown received from other communities in the immediate aftermath. Many cities -- in the United States and around the world -- sent volunteers and supplies to aid the rescue and recovery effort. ""9/11 changed all of us forever, but 9/12 changed us just as much,"" said Parness, 45. ""That outpouring of kindness and generosity, to me, was more powerful than the terror that happened the day before."" That spirit of goodwill inspired Parness to create New York Says Thank You, an organization that sends volunteers from New York City to disaster-stricken communities every year -- normally around the 9/11 anniversary. To date, more than 7,000 people have participated in the group's rebuilding projects. Running a nonprofit isn't something that Parness, a former software venture capitalist who lives in Manhattan, ever thought he'd do. He had never been community service-oriented. But a suggestion from his 5-year-old son changed all of that. In November 2003, Parness' son, Evan, saw a news report about wildfires near San Diego. He asked his dad if he could send the children in California some of his toys. Parness suggested that they ask all of the children in their apartment building for donations. Three days later, Parness and two friends were headed to San Diego in a truck half-filled with toys and supplies. Parness put a sign on the truck that read: ""New York Says Thank You."" ""I wanted to make a bigger statement,"" he said. ""I wanted to let people know that New Yorkers will never forget what people did for us after 9/11."" As Parness and his buddies made their way to California, people they encountered along the way added donations. By the time they arrived, the truck was full. The whole experience deeply touched Parness, who wanted to turn it into something more. That's when he came up with the idea of helping a different city every year. ""On a day that's about destruction ... let's create an organization that's focused on helping people rebuild,"" he said. ""It's our way to really honor the sense of spirit and volunteerism (of) 9/12."" Each year, Parness finds a community that has been hit by a disaster and he selects a structure to rebuild there. The projects often hold some significance to the area -- a historic church in Indiana, a veterans' home in Texas, a Boy Scout camp in Iowa. But Parness says that in a way, what's being built really doesn't matter. ""It's not about building structures. It's about building hope,"" he said. ""We want able to touch people who are still recovering from disasters and show them that other people care."" For the organization's first project in September 2004, Parness brought 14 volunteers from New York City to rebuild homes destroyed by the wildfires outside of San Diego. The next build, in September 2005, was in Utica, Illinois, a city that had been hit by a deadly tornado. Thirty New Yorkers made the trip this time, and they were joined by eight people from California who had received help the previous year. It is this cycle of ""paying it forward"" that is at the heart of New York Says Thank You. It's also part of what gives the group its unique character: Nearly all of its volunteers have survived a disaster of some sort, be it natural or man-made. That shared connection means a lot to firefighter Brian Fitzpatrick, who was at ground zero on 9/11 and lost 10 members of his fire academy class that day. As a volunteer for New York Says Thank You the last four years, he says he is motivated by helping others who've also lived through a tragedy. ""You're there to let them know that ... they're not alone,"" he said. ""It's like a crazy club that you join."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . The organization has helped communities in nine states since 2003, and its web of volunteers now extends across the country. With more volunteers from outside New York than from the city itself, Parness says his group isn't really about New York anymore -- it's about America. Eric Kreippen, a firefighter from Slidell, Louisiana, would agree. He has been a dedicated volunteer since Parness' group came to his community after Hurricane Katrina. He says he's ""addicted"" to the experience, and he brings more people with him every year. ""This past year, I brought 22 people to Arkansas,"" Kreippen said. ""This whole 'paying it forward' thing, it's just contagious."" Every September, Parness' army of disaster survivors -- usually 200-300 people -- rolls into town for what amounts to an old-fashioned barn-raising. The atmosphere is like a family reunion as volunteers from past projects reunite. The locals ""can't believe that people from Manhattan and Slidell and Indiana and all of these towns are all in their town to help them,"" Kreippen said. ""You get the thanks, and it's 'No, we're here because we went through the same thing!' "" Working side by side, many volunteers form friendships and stay in touch year-round. ""You're banging nails and building something, but it's the relationships that help you heal,"" Fitzpatrick said. Many volunteers discover that the work helps them move forward with their own lives. Megan Manning lost her husband on 9/11, and she has been volunteering with New York Says Thank You since 2007. She said the experiences have completely changed her attitude every time September 11 comes up on the calendar. ""Ever since it started, I wake up on 9/11 and I feel grateful,"" she said. ""That's huge for me."" It's huge for Parness as well. ""When I started this, I thought it was about building homes and churches that were destroyed, "" Parness said. ""When we went on ... I realized that 50% of value went to the survivors, but 50% went to the volunteers. It's empowering."" This year, for the 10th anniversary of 9/11, Parness is planning to go to Ellijay, Georgia, a small town that was hit by a tornado earlier this month. There, he hopes to rebuild a barn that housed Build An Ark Animal Rescue, a sanctuary that saves and rehabilitates animals. ""We always look for special projects that could benefit a community,"" Parness said. ""This lovely woman, Susan Littlejohn, lived in the barn with 65 animals that she used as therapeutic companions for disabled children and senior citizens. ... We couldn't think of a better place to do this year."" A new documentary about Parness' group, also called New York Says Thank You, will premiere April 28 at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. Parness says the film's message is about the power of volunteerism, and he hopes it will inspire people to get involved, in some way, in their community. ""This is about honoring that volunteer spirit,"" he said. ""It shows that nothing is impossible if you can come together."" Want to get involved?

1452,"(CNN) -- Southern California residents and recovery crews continued their cleanup efforts Saturday, two days after powerful winds downed power lines, damaged structures and caused other devastation. ""From what we have been told, this was probably the worst windstorm to hit this particular area in over a decade,"" said Bob Spencer, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. While the weather was good Saturday, with clear skies and high temperatures in the 60s, that didn't mean the headaches were over. Residents still faced the prospect of new wildfires breaking out and spreading -- as evidenced by the red-flag warning in effect through Sunday morning in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The National Weather Service issued the warning -- which means that conditions are favorable for fire to grow rapidly if it ignites -- through Sunday morning due to gusty northeast winds and low relative humidity. The strong winds that continued to blow Saturday, though, were well short of the hurricane-force gusts measured Thursday and Friday. It was an extreme manifestation of a regional reality: Santa Ana winds, a condition in which strong winds descend to the Pacific Coast around Los Angeles from inland desert regions, according to the National Weather Service. The weather service reported gusts stronger than 140 mph along the Sierra Crest mountain ridge, while there were roughly 100 mph-hour winds in the San Gabriel Mountain Foothills of southern California, said Southern California Edison spokesman Gil Alexander. Widespread damage in southwestern California led Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich to issue a state of emergency ""to ensure that state and federal financial resources are available to serve county residents impacted by the windstorms."" The effects are still being felt. Southern California Edison, for example, had 77,400 customers still without power as of 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET) on Saturday, said Alexander. And the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power reported in an online news release that, as of 3 p.m., about 7,000 households in its coverage area still didn't have electricity. Those numbers, while significant, mark a major drop from those reported several days ago. More than 200,000 of the Los Angeles utility's customers didn't have power at one point, while Edison had about 250,000 in the dark, said Alexander. ""Four hours ago, we had over 90,000 customers without power,"" Alexander said early Saturday evening. ""That tells you crews are making progress, rather than responding to more outages."" Communities along the San Gabriel Mountain foothills, where he lives -- including Monrovia, Sierra Madre and La Canada Flintridge -- suffered especially extensive damage in Edison's territory. Alexander said that the utility had more than 500 personnel out working and urged residents to steer clear of power-lines for their own safety. Los Angeles County also had ""several hundred personnel spanned out across"" the county to deal with fallen trees and clear out debris, said Spencer. That includes 50 county public works personnel alone in the hard-hit city of Pasadena, with the spokesman estimating they would be there for at least a week. One positive, aside from gusty if not likely damaging winds, is that the weather appears to be cooperating. In Pasadena, conditions are forecast to be sunny or mostly sunny, with day-time highs in 60s and nighttime lows in the 40s, all next week, according to the weather service.","85,000 households were still without power Saturday evening, two utilities report .

1453,"New York (CNN) -- New Jersey resident Becky Fisher said Tuesday that she's counting the favors she'll now owe her neighbors after a powerful snowstorm left her family and more than a million others without power across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. Fisher, along with her husband and their 6-month-old daughter, have been camped out at a neighbor's house in Maplewood, New Jersey, since the weekend storm coated her home in snow and knocked down trees and power lines across the region. ""There are just pockets of those who have electricity,"" Fisher said. ""So we're using our neighbors' goodwill. ""We'll owe them lots."" Fisher said they first lost power Saturday and were forced to relocate to her neighbor's house the following night as temperatures dropped to just above freezing. Fisher said that while she and her husband are accustomed to cold weather, they didn't want to risk it with their child. ""Every time I call (the state's utility provider), they say the ticket's open,"" she said. ""Initially the message (of when power would be restored) was for Wednesday night, then Thursday, and now maybe Friday. ""Luckily, we have nice neighbors,"" she added. By Tuesday evening, about 195,000 New Jersey residents remained without power. Meanwhile, temperatures in parts of New England were expected to hit the low 50s Tuesday, which could be considered balmy to some who braved the October snowstorm that dropped more than 2 feet of snow in some places over the weekend. But while temperatures are on the rise for parts of the Northeastern United States, more than 1 million residents were still in the dark, dealing with widespread power outages. On Monday, officials warned it could be Friday before power is back on everywhere. At least 15 deaths have been blamed on the weekend storm, which prompted emergency declarations from the governors of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts, and also canceled Halloween trick-or-treating in some areas. President Barack Obama signed an emergency declaration for Connecticut Monday, ordering federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts. Gov. Dannel Malloy on Tuesday said he was not satisfied by the number of crews coming from out of state, CNN Hartford affiliate WFSB reported. By Tuesday evening, about 612,000 Connecticut residents remained without power, down from a peak of 830,000, according to the state utility company. More than 900 crews were restoring electricity. About a dozen Massachusetts cities postponed Halloween celebrations, according to CNN affiliate WGGB. At least 20 Connecticut cities and towns, including the capital, Hartford, canceled events or asked parents to wait until later to take their kids trick-or-treating, according to CNN affiliate WFSB. Malloy and his wife, Cathy, said they will be leaving the lights off. ""No amount of candy is worth a potentially serious or even fatal accident,"" the governor said in a statement. In Worcester, Massachusetts, officials asked residents to postpone Halloween celebrations until Thursday, when temperatures are expected to climb to 60 degrees. Trick-or-treating, the city said, would ""put families and our youth in harm's way as they negotiate piles of snow and downed limbs."" In Springfield, Massachusetts, school officials announced classes would be canceled for the week. Some of the heaviest snow fell in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, but snowfall amounts of at least a foot were recorded from West Virginia to Maine. The Berkshire County community of Peru, Massachusetts, received 32 inches of snow during the storm. In Massachusetts, state officials said utility crews had come from as far as Louisiana and Texas to help. About 256,000 people remained without power Tuesday evening, according to officials. Elsewhere, about 77,000 customers were without power in Pennsylvania. Thousands also lost power in New Hampshire, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, according to figures from emergency managers and power companies in those states. About 128,000 were affected in New York. As of Monday, authorities reported at least 15 deaths blamed on the storm. Three people died in Massachusetts, officials said, including a Lunenberg resident who died in a fire and a resident of Hatfield who succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning, apparently from an improperly vented generator. The third death happened in Springfield when a man in his 20s ignored police barricades surrounding downed power lines and touched a metal guardrail, which was charged, city fire department spokesman Dennis Legere said. Four people also died in New Jersey because of the storm, police said. Two were killed in motor vehicle accidents, one in Bergen County and one in Passaic County, while two others died after trees fell on their cars. In Connecticut, four people died, officials said. They included one person who died in a traffic accident in Hebron, a second who died in an accident on Interstate 91 in Hartford, one who died in an ATV accident in Enfield and one who died of carbon monoxide poisoning while trying to heat their home, also in Enfield.

1455,"(CNN) -- Italian football champions AC Milan have announced that Antonio Cassano will undergo heart surgery, after the striker was hospitalized following last weekend's 3-2 win against Roma. The Italy international fell ill after Saturday's match at the Stadio Olimpico, with a statement from the seven-time European champions on Wednesday confirming the 29-year-old experienced ""ischemic cerebral damage."" The condition was caused by a malformation in Cassano's heart, resulting in poor blood flow to the brain -- which can lead to possible vision, movement and speech restrictions. Milan said he suffered no lasting neurological damage but will now face months on the sidelines. Messi treble puts Barca into the last 16 . ""AC Milan, according to medical reports of the Policlinico in Milan, have said that Antonio Cassano has experienced ischemic cerebral damage,"" read the statement on the 18-time Serie A title winners' official website. ""The cause was identified as the presence of a patent foramen ovale septal heart, detectable only with sophisticated specialized investigations. The timing of therapy established has allowed a rapid recovery and improvement of clinical conditions. ""In the coming days the player will undergo a small surgical interventional cardiology (closure of the foramen ovale). The recovery time for return to playing will be better defined after the surgery, but probably will be a few months."" In Cassano's absence, the Rossoneri ensured their progression into the last 16 of the European Champions League on Tuesday with a 1-1 draw at BATE Borisov of Belarus. Ghana midfielder Kevin Prince Boateng revealed a shirt with Cassano's name and number on it after striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic gave Massimiliano Allegri's side a first-half lead. Midfielder Renan Bressan later equalized for BATE from the penalty spot, but a point was enough to ensure Milan's place in the knockout stages. An often controversial figure, Cassano began his career with hometown club Bari before making a big-money move to Roma as a teenager in 2001. After five years in the Italian capital he switched to Spain with nine-time European champions Real Madrid. Following an unhappy spell ruined by injury and a falling-out with coach Fabio Capello, Cassano returned home to Sampdoria in 2008 after a season's loan before joining Milan in January this year -- a move prompted by another dispute, this time with the Genoa side's chairman Riccardo Garrone. He will be hoping to recover in time to be part of Cesare Prandelli's Italy squad for next year's European Championship in Poland and Ukraine, which starts in June 2012.","AC Milan's Antonio Cassano will undergo heart surgery .

1456,"(CNN) -- The families of seven people killed and 61 survivors injured when a stage collapsed at the Indiana State Fair in August are being offered a total of $5 million by Indiana's attorney general. The settlements proposed by the state are separate from the lawsuit most of the families filed last month against Sugarland, the country duo that was set to perform just before a windstorm caused metal scaffolding to fall on dozens of fans. The estate of each of those who died would get at least $300,000, while the injured would get 65% of their medical expenses paid out of the state's tort claims fund, Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a news release Tuesday. ""No amount of money ever can replace lives lost or alleviate anguish endured by the victims of the Indiana State Fair tragedy,"" Zoeller said. ""Because state law limits the amount the state can pay to $5 million per incident or $700,000 per individual and we are legally obligated to defend those limits, we had to make extremely difficult decisions about which injured victims would receive payment out of the limited pool of funds available."" The estates and survivors must decide by December 12 if they will accept the state's offer or pursue tort claims in court. Metal scaffolding supporting the stage lights fell onto the ""Sugarpit,"" a section usually occupied by Sugarland's most faithful fans, when a storm swept through the Indiana State Fair on August 13. A lawsuit filed last month by 48 plaintiffs contends that the band ""failed or refused to cancel the Sugarland concert despite inclement weather"" and that it had ""ultimate control over the lighting"" that fell on many of the victims. ""Sugarland had supervisory authority and discretion for stage size, lighting, instruments, trusses, sound equipment and location of sound equipment, and the stage system,"" the suit said. Forecasters warned that heavy rain and strong winds would hit the fair nearly two hours before the storm moved through, causing the collapse of the stage. The National Weather Service estimated winds at 60 to 70 mph. ""Sugarland was not required to perform if Sugarland determined their performance would be impaired or prevented due to inclement weather,"" the suit said. ""The decision whether to cancel the Sugarland concert due to weather conditions was the responsibility of Sugarland."" Sugarland's representative said the group would offer no comment about the lawsuit. The suit also names other defendants, including Mid-America Sound, the company that rented the stage, roof and lighting system, and event promoter Live Nation.","Families of those killed would get $300,000 each, while injured would get 65% of medical bills .

1457,"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- A second typhoon in a week pounded the Philippines over the weekend, weakening Sunday only after prompting evacuations, causing severe flooding and contributing to at least one death, officials said. Typhoon Nalgae, known locally as Quiel, lost some strength by Sunday morning, though it still had maximum sustained winds of 130 kph (80 mph), with gusts recorded 30 kph (18.6 miles) stronger, according to an 11 a.m. Sunday advisory from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Administration. At that point, its center was 290 kilometers (180 miles) west of Baguio City. The storm comes on the heels of Typhoon Nesat, which left 52 people dead and hit 34 provinces Tuesday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council. The two typhoons have affected about 3 million Filipinos, according to the nonprofit humanitarian group, World Vision. ""The immediate need is ready-to-eat food and water,"" said Jay Mijares, a spokesman for the group. ""Survivors have no means to cook food. We are seeing a mass exodus of people looking for food, there is no supply, and on top of that their livelihood is disrupted. They have money but there's just nothing to buy."" The latest typhoon -- Nalgae -- made landfall in Dinapigue, in Isabela province, on Saturday morning, the disaster council said. It moved past the Asian island nation by Sunday, forecasters said, after having brought rain of 15-25 millimeters per hour (0.6-1 inch) in many areas. The heavy rains caused a landslide Saturday that swept a passenger van off a highway, killing one man and injuring one more, the disaster council said . At least 850 families, or roughly 3,500 people, in the provinces of La Union and Pangasinan were affected by flooding, according to a Sunday morning update by the council. Over the course of the weekend, the storm forced the closure of a number of bridges and made a number of roads impassable in the cities of Calasiao and Dagupan on Luzon island, according to the disaster council. Affected residents are being evacuated from those communities and others, including Santa Barbara. Officials suspended operations at ports in Balanan, Batangas, Lucena, Puerto Real, Kawit and Calapan City, the disaster council said. Service was expected to be restored at some ports by late Sunday morning, the council said. By Sunday, gates were opened at four dams that had reached their spillage levels, the council said. World Vision said Saturday that it had to postpone some of its relief efforts from the first typhoon due to Nalgae, with two of three emergency teams set to deploy once the storm passes. Another team is in Bulcan province, most of which is ""still submerged"" from heavy rains from the first typhoon that struck days earlier. Sherbien Dacalanio, a CNN iReporter in the Philippines, described one area of Manila as being devastated by Nesat. ""The damage is shocking. It's like a damage brought by earthquake and tsunami,"" Dacalanio said. CNN's Ivan Cabrera and journalist Arlene Samson-Espiritu contributed to this report.","Heavy rains in latest typhoon cause a landslide that sweeps a van off a road, killing 1 .
Gates are opened at four dams that have reached maximum containment, officials say .

1458,"New York (CNN) -- A woman who died in a helicopter crash in New York's East River was identified by authorities as Sonia Marra of Sydney, Australia and died on her 40 birtthday, authorities said Wednesday. Marra was the only passenger who died after Tuesday's crash in the river near midtown Manhattan, New York police said. Marra, who is also a British citizen, was traveling with a friend her mother, stepfather when the chopper went down, CNN affiliate WABC reported. The other were injured but Marra got trapped in the backseat of the Bell 206 chopper and was the sole passenger unable to escape the craft as it inverted and sank, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. As the chopper approached for a helipad landing, the pilot radioed that he was having problems, just moments before the craft crashed into the river, the mayor said. Images broadcast on CNN affiliate WCBS soon after the crash showed at least three people being towed to shore in a rescue effort. U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat who represents Manhattan's East Side in Congress, said in a statement she was ""saddened and deeply concerned"" about the crash. ""There have been at least 28 helicopter crashes in our city over the last three decades,"" Maloney said. ""Federal transportation officials should investigate not only the causes of this crash, but also whether it is safe to have such a high volume of helicopter traffic over our densely populated city."" Had the crash occurred over land, the death toll could have been much higher, she said.

1459,"(CNN) -- Police on Tuesday scoured the area in Detroit where Bianca Jones was last reported seen, searching for any signs of the missing 2-year-old girl. Bianca was reportedly traveling with her father in a 2004 silver Mercury Grand Marquis on Friday when they were carjacked, said Sgt. Eren Stephens, a spokeswoman with Detroit police. ""The suspect took off in the car with her in it,"" she said, citing what the father told authorities. The vehicle was subsequently recovered, but the girl remains missing. However, Detroit Police Chief Ralph Godbee Jr. said in a statement over the weekend that the ""authenticity and credibility of the original version of events is under intense scrutiny by our investigative team,"" seeming to suggest that police do not believe what the father told them happened. ""At this time, we're looking at everything,"" Stephens said. Bianca is described as African-American, 2 feet, 5 inches tall, 25 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a pink dress, pink tights, pink shoes and a purple coat, according to an Amber Alert issued last week by the Michigan State Police. Her father, D'Andre Lane, spoke to HLN's Nancy Grace on Tuesday night, begging whoever took his daughter to bring her back. ""I don't care about anything else that's going on right now but my daughter's safe return home to her family,"" he said. ""I just want my daughter back home."" Lane appeared alongside his attorney, Terry L. Johnson, who said his client gave police permission to enter his home and has fully cooperated in the investigation. Stephens declined to say whether police have searched Lane's house. ""My daughter is a beautiful little girl. She has a bright personality. She's the type of person that lights up a room when she walks in it. She's very intelligent,"" Lane told HLN's Grace. ""She's just a wonderful little girl to be around."" About 150 volunteers turned out on Monday to help look for Bianca, said Stephens, who also declined to comment on whether they or police had found anything useful. She urged anyone with information on the possible whereabouts of the little girl to contact Detroit police.","NEW: The father of the missing girl describes his daughter as beautiful, bright and intelligent .

1460,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- On September 11, 2001, Kathryn Freed watched from two blocks away as a plane hit the World Trade Center's north tower. After September 11, most of lower Manhattan was covered in thick dust from the collapsed towers. ""Honestly, it was so surreal,"" Freed said. ""We heard the plane coming -- it was very low and very loud -- and we watched it go right over our heads; we just watched it hit dead center the north tower. I stood there and watched the skin of the building come off. It looked like tinsel from a Christmas tree falling down."" A short while later, Freed saw the second plane plow through the south tower in a giant fireball. And as she headed back toward her apartment, four blocks from what was soon to be known as ground zero, the south tower collapsed, sending a plume of debris into the air and straight down her street. Freed believes that the lingering cloud of dust -- caused by the towers' collapse and the digging out of ground zero -- caused some of her long- and short-term medical problems, such as her ""WTC cough"" and other respiratory issues. She's among the many residents of lower Manhattan, emergency responders, recovery workers, commuters and passers-by to have developed serious, sometimes chronic medical problems since the terrorist attack seven years ago. A commission charged with examining the scope and depth of the attack's health effects reviewed more than 100 scientific articles published since 2001 and found that new asthma levels among residents and rescue workers were two to three times higher than the national estimates. The report by the World Trade Center Medical Working Group, issued in advance of the September 11 anniversary, also found that  two to three years after the attack, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder remained elevated among rescue and recovery workers and residents of lower Manhattan.  Interactive: More on PTSD » . But the most reassuring finding was that in all the studies they looked at, there was consistency. ""The primary finding of the report, as you synthesize the main findings from more than 100 peer review articles on the health ramifications of 9/11, is that the findings are very similar across the studies,"" Lorna Thorpe said. Thorpe, the deputy commissioner in the Division of Epidemiology at New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, is a member of the Medical Working Group. ""That is a very important characteristic to us when we are trying to say how well we understand the short- and medium-term health ramifications,"" she said. The group, appointed last year by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is composed of 16 professionals with varied areas of expertise who include researchers, clinicians, psychiatrists, pulmonologists and environmental health experts. According to their report, there were also glimmers of good news: New diagnoses of the autoimmune disorder sarcoidosis, which were elevated among responding firefighters early on, are now back to pre-September 11 rates; early symptoms for PTSD resolved quickly for most people; and any impact on birth outcomes was small in magnitude. ""The review of existing services found that at the moment, the panoply of services that exist in New York City are sufficient for those who are stepping forward with potential 9/11 illnesses, but moving forward, additional federal support for sustaining those services is critical,"" Thorpe said, adding that the bigger the outreach effort, the greater the chance of demand to outstrip supply. According to the group, there are still many unanswered questions, including how extensively the disaster affected the health of residents, area workers and students; what kind of exposure increased risk; how persistent the mental and physical symptoms are; how prevalent depression and substance abuse are; whether there is a possibility of trade center-related cancer; and how effective is the treatment received by those who sought it. The medical working group also issued recommendations, including advocating for long-term federal funding to ensure that treatment and monitoring can continue; expanding the research into trade center-related conditions and evaluating the treatments involved; and expanding the education efforts to increase awareness of both the availability of medical resources for those affected and the clinical guidelines created to treat them. Freed believes that she was lucky in that she was ""too busy"" to develop PTSD; at the time, she was a New York council member and spent the months after the attack working to get her neighborhood back on its feet, bringing in supplies, medicine, information and services. She also continued to live in her apartment, where inches of dust had collected on the terrace, and didn't leave the neighborhood with its ever-present dust cloud for months. ""At that time, I had such a bad WTC cough -- I had gone to one of the doctors at Mount Sinai [hospital], and he basically told me to get out of the district because I was having such a hard time breathing,"" she said. ""Like everyone down there, I had a bad cough and what I thought was heartburn, but after the doctor's visit, I realized the air was so, so caustic that just breathing ended up burning your respiratory system."" To this day, Freed, who is now a civil court judge for Manhattan, suffers from the breathing problems and allergies that developed after the attack, and although she occasionally gets ""the cough,"" it doesn't bother her nearly as often. The WTC Medical Working Group is expected to issue an update every year. Freed is glad they are around, but she added, ""It might have been nice to have it seven years ago.""","Working group looked at more than 100 studies done since 2001 .

1461,"(CNN) -- Four people in Japan have been killed amid heavy rain from a powerful typhoon that is expected to make landfall Wednesday afternoon, authorities there said. The center of Typhoon Roke, which had sustained winds of up to 167 kph (103 mph) Wednesday morning, could hit Japan's Tokai region, which includes Nagoya city -- or the Kanto region, which includes Tokyo -- in the afternoon, Japan Meteorological Agency chief forecaster Yutaka Kanda said at a news conference. At of 8:45 a.m. Wednesday, Roke's center was 280 kilometers southwest of Nagoya, where about 1 million people had been urged to evacuate. An evacuation order for about 80,000 residents of Nagoya was lifted, according to local media reports. Heavy rain fell in central and western Japan from the typhoon's outer bands on Tuesday and Wednesday. Some downpours came at up to 50 millimeters (2 inches) an hour, and some parts received more than 450 millimeters (17 inches) over a day, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Four people have died in Nagoya, including a 66-year-old man who fell from a roof Tuesday while trying to fix a stuck duct, city authorities said. Two other people -- a fourth-grade boy and an 84-year-old man -- were missing in Gifu prefecture, authorities said. People in the Tokai and Kanto regions should be prepared for heavy rain Wednesday, Kanda said, adding that the Kanto region may be most affected Wednesday evening. No airports were closed Wednesday, but several flights toward the Kyushu and Shikoku areas were canceled, transportation officials said.

1462,"(CNN) -- Three women kicked off an AirTran plane bound for New York say a ""bully"" flight attendant is to blame. The passengers -- who did not know each other before the Monday flight from West Palm Beach, Florida, to White Plains, New York, but were seated in the same section of the plane -- say the incident started during boarding when a male flight attendant began roughly handling bags in the overhead bin. ""I said, 'Hey, I have breakables in that,' "" recalled Marilyn Miller, according to CNN affiliate WPTV-TV in West Palm Beach. But she said the comment only seemed to make his behavior worse. ""It was just like a bully and I found myself shaking."" Passenger Carol Gray told the TV station that she flagged the same flight attendant for help with another problem. ""I said, 'Excuse me sir, my seat is broken,' and he looked at me and said, 'I'm not talking to you,' and poked me in the arm,"" Gray told WPTV. The passengers said the flight attendant then began to get angry and told them to leave the plane, according to WPTV. That's when a third woman, who had been watching the situation unfold, told the station she decided to intervene. ""I said, 'This is crazy, they didn't do anything. Why are you doing this to them?' And he said, 'Throw her off, too,' "" Karyn Schorr told WPTV. Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies were called to the scene and stood by as the women exited the plane and went to another gate, said Eric Davis, a spokesman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. The women were not cited or charged with any crimes, WPTV reported. Southwest Airlines, which owns AirTran, said it booked new travel arrangements for the passengers and compensated them as ""a gesture of goodwill for their inconvenience."" ""Our goal is always to mitigate any uncomfortable situation prior to departure. Our crew assessed the environment onboard and ultimately decided to accommodate the passengers on an alternative flight,"" spokeswoman Brandy King said. ""We always prefer that a passenger walk away with a positive experience when flying our airline; we regret that didn't happen in this scenario. As we often do in these situations, we will take this opportunity to review the reports and take away any key learnings that we might uncover.""","Three passengers were asked to leave an AirTran flight .

1463,"Tokyo (CNN) -- The Japanese government has affirmed that $29 million from its budget for post-earthquake and tsunami reconstruction is going toward extra security measures for the country's whaling fleet, angering environmental activists like Greenpeace. The whaling industry is ""siphoning money away from the victims of the March 11 triple disaster, at a time when they need it most,"" Junichi Sato, executive director of Greenpeace Japan, said this week, referring to the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis that struck Japan in March. But Tatsuya Nakaoku, an official from the Japanese Fisheries Agency, said Thursday he funds would help ""support the reconstruction of a whaling town and nearby area,"" which was devastated by the natural disasters. ""Many people in the area eat whale meat,"" he said. ""They are waiting for Japan's commercial whaling to resume and it is their hope for recovery."" The government had said earlier this year, after it passed the tsunami reconstruction budget, that it would strengthen ""measures against acts of sabotage by anti-whaling groups,"" Nakaoku said. The government earmarked a total of 498.9 billion yen ($6.4 billion) of the reconstruction budget for spending on fisheries. Of that, 2.28 billion yen has been put into extra security measures for the whaling fleet, which left port for its annual hunt Tuesday. Japan's whale hunts are conducted by the Institute of Cetacean Research, a nonprofit research organization overseen by Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. An official from the Japanese Coast Guard said the deployment of guards this year to protect the fleet from obstruction by anti-whaling activists was the largest yet, but declined to give exact numbers. The Coast Guard had previously provided protection to the fleet for its 2007-08 and 2010-11 hunts. Last season's whale hunt in the Southern Ocean was cut short when anti-whaling activists from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society blocked strikes on the animals. Sea Shepherd said its actions saved 800 whales, and the organization has promised to be back in force this season. Japan has faced international pressure to curtail its whaling activities. In 2010, Australia initiated proceedings in the International Court of Justice to stop Japanese whaling.

1464,"London (CNN) -- At least seven people are confirmed dead and 51 injured in a ""horrific"" traffic accident in southwest England, Somerset police said Saturday. The accident involved 34 vehicles, including cars, vans and large trucks, police said, some of which erupted into a ""fireball."" Assistant Chief Constable Anthony Bangham told reporters more bodies are feared to be still trapped in badly burnt vehicles. Some of the vehicles are ""burnt to the ground"" and unrecognizable, he said in a televised news conference after visiting the site. ""This is a horrific scene."" The crash occurred about 8:25 p.m. Friday on the M5 highway near Taunton in Somerset, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Bristol, according to the Devon and Somerset Fire Rescue. Bangham said poor weather was likely to have been a factor, with wet roads after rain and banks of fog reported in the area. Police were also looking into a nearby fireworks display to see if it may have played a role, he said. He praised members of the public who showed ""real bravery"" in trying to rescue people from blazing vehicles, as well as the efforts of the emergency services. ""For a motorway incident, this is just about as big as it gets,"" he said. ""This is a highly complex, very dramatic incident for our officers."" He said part of the highway would remain closed in both directions until at least Sunday. About 15 fire trucks were sent to the scene, as rescue workers battled to extinguish blazing vehicles and cut free trapped passengers.

1465,"(CNN) -- The massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on Friday spared the island of Indonesia, a nearby developing country that was devastated in 2004 by one of the deadliest tsunamis in history. Helping after that disaster was CNN Hero Robin Lim. Lim is the founder of Indonesia's Yayasan Bumi Sehat health clinics, which provide free prenatal and birthing care to women in need. Lim recently spoke with CNN's Ebonne Ruffins about how her midwife teams respond in natural disasters, balancing critical medical needs with cultural traditions. Ebonne Ruffins: What's it like to work in Indonesia and, specifically, after the 2004 tsunami? Robin Lim: In Indonesia, there is a great need for us because many mothers want the help of professional birth attendants but can't afford them. So they come to us. It was not easy to start so grass-roots in Bali, completely reliant on donations, but we did it. And when the tsunami happened a few years later in Aceh, we were early responders. So many on the eastern coast lost everything, and it was very difficult to witness. But we had to be there for those who survived or were fighting to survive. Ruffins: How do your teams provide maternal and infant care in the middle of a devastated area? Lim: Because the devastation can ruin entire clinics and resources, we have to be prepared to treat them with limited materials. Instead of cutting the umbilical cord, for instance, we burn it -- especially in disaster zones, because it's something we can teach our midwives and doctors who've lost their instruments. Using scissors to sever the umbilical cord carries a risk of tetanus. If you burn the cord, there's just no risk of infection. And outside of just knowing how to safely respond medically, we try to have respect for everyone's faith. We don't have any particular religion, and we'll honor all requests and faith traditions -- special songs, flowers or chants. No matter what they are or where we are, we honor these faiths. This helps the moms feel safe and supported with us. Video: Watch a cord-burning ceremony at Lim's clinic . Ruffins: You've delivered enough babies to repopulate another island. Have you learned anything from the people you've helped? Lim: I've learned a lot. Quite often I cry tears of joy because I feel humbled. Once in a while, a baby is born that doesn't breathe. Normally CPR works, but sometimes no matter what you do, that baby just wasn't meant to make it. That really humbles us, because we have control over reducing risks for the mothers and babies but I have learned we don't have control over fate. There are so many more good days than bad, though. When there is a long night and there is an emergency, the mothers just hang in there -- and the babies, too. They are so strong, and they push through -- literally. That's love. They have taught me that this world is really worth preserving. The babies come in so fresh and innocent, trusting and open to love. And if we can just give them a safe and gentle entrance into this world, then they will keep that ability to love and trust.

1466,"(CNN) -- Lighthouse keeper J.A. Eckerman was the last person to see World War II Soviet submarine S-2 before it sank in January 1940 between Sweden and Finland. A team of Swedish and Finnish divers had been searching for the Soviet submarine S-2 since 1999. As the submarine dove near the island of Market, northwest of Aland, Eckerman heard a loud explosion and saw smoke rise from the water. The long-lost wreck was missing for 69 years until a team of Swedish and Finnish divers -- including Eckerman's grandson Ingvald -- discovered it this year. What remains of the sub was found between the Swedish coast and the Finnish island of Aland, northeast of Stockholm, in late February, the divers announced Tuesday. The submarine was very badly damaged by the explosion, said Marten Zetterstrom, one of the divers. The front gun is still there, and a torpedo is still in one of the tubes, but about 20 meters (about 65 feet) of the vessel is missing. The search had been going on for nearly 10 years, the divers said in a news release. The sub had a crew of 46 and four passengers when it sank. Sweden and Finland claim credit for sinking the submarine with mines. Russia has contacted Swedish and Finnish authorities to clarify what caused the submarine to sink, the divers said. Finland was at war with the Soviet Union at the time the sub sank. A deal between Germany and the Soviets had put the Nordic nation within the Soviet ""sphere of influence,"" and Soviet troops had invaded Finland late in 1939. The fighting was mostly confined to Finland's eastern border. Just two months after the submarine's sinking, a temporary peace agreement was reached. Sweden remained neutral in World War II.

1467,"Mexico City (CNN) -- A strong 6.5-magnitude earthquake hit southern Mexico on Saturday night, killing two people and startling residents as far away as Mexico City, state media reported. It struck in Guerrero state at 7:47 p.m. local time, about 100 miles south-southwest of the capital, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The agency had previously put the quake's magnitude at 6.7. One person was killed when a rock fell on a vehicle, while another was crushed by a collapsed house, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing civil protection officials in Guerrero. At least 50 homes were damaged and at least four people were injured there, Notimex said. There were no immediate reports of major damage in the capital, but several areas were without power, Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard wrote on his Twitter page soon after the quake. Some startled residents in Mexico City ran out of their houses and into the streets. Loud sirens sounded after the quake, which had an estimated depth of 40 miles, the USGS said. Lorena Isla, a CNN iReporter in San Jeronimo Lidice, on the outskirts of Mexico City, took video of chandeliers swaying at her home. The side-to-side movement of the earthquake lasted about three minutes, said Isla, who lives on the third floor of a residence. ""This was the strongest one I ever felt,"" she said late Saturday. She took the video and rushed outside, where she said she fainted. ""Everybody is in panic,"" Isla said. Authorities urged residents to turn off natural gas devices. Some were having a hard time reaching relatives because of cell phone disruptions, according to Isla.

1468,"(CNN) -- A bus carrying students and faculty from Abilene Christian University to a weekend mission project overturned Friday afternoon near Paint Rock, Texas, resulting in one death and multiple injuries, the school said. Grant Rampy, director of public relations for the university in Abilene, said the bus was headed to a children's home in Medina in south-central Texas. The crash occurred about 3:20 p.m. on U.S. 83 in Runnels County, the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement. The driver lost control and the bus struck a concrete culvert and rolled once, authorities said. Several students were ejected.

1470,"(CNN) -- Search and rescue teams on Friday were trying to reach an airplane that crashed with 18 people aboard in the mountains of western Indonesia, an air transportation official said. Air traffic controllers lost contact with the airplane Thursday morning shortly after it took off from the Medan Polonia Airport in North Sumatra. It was bound for the Kutacane district in Aceh province when it crashed in the mountains in North Sumatra, said Henry Bakti, Indonesia's director general for air transportation. The plane was spotted during an aerial search, and it appeared to be largely intact, Bakti told reporters. The condition of the passengers, including two children and two infants, was not immediately known, he said. Nusantara Buana Air owns the plane, which operates nine planes and services destinations in Aceh from the Medan Polonia and Banda Aceh airports. Airplanes are the primary mode of transportation between Indonesia's scattered islands. In May, a plane that crashed off the coast of Kaimana killed at least 15 people. Indonesia's poor aviation record has led the European Union and the United States to blacklist a number of the country's small airlines, including Nusantara Buana Air.

1471,"(CNN) -- Federal health officials are expanding efforts to ensure no additional bacteria-tainted cantaloupes get to consumers in what has become the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness in more than a decade. The Food and Drug Administration said it has teamed up with state officials in the effort. ""FDA and its state partners are conducting checks at retail stores, wholesalers and distributors to make sure they have received notification about the Jensen Farms' whole cantaloupe recall and that they have taken appropriate action to notify their customers and remove the recalled whole cantaloupes from the shelves,"" the agency said in a statement Wednesday. Thirteen people have died in what has become the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998, according to records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported September 12. It was traced to consumption of Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms' fields in Granada, Colorado. What you need to know about Listeria . As of Monday, it had grown to 18 states, 72 illnesses and 13 deaths, according to the CDC's latest statistics. ""Because some of the wholesalers and distributors may have further distributed the recalled cantaloupes to food processors, it is possible that additional products that contain cantaloupe from Jensen Farms could be recalled,"" the FDA said. ""There is no indication of foreign distribution at this time."" In 1998, 21 people died from consuming tainted hot dogs, according to a CDC database. Food poisoning 101 . In the current outbreak, four people who ate contaminated cantaloupes died in New Mexico, two each in Colorado and Texas, and one each in Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. Public health officials also have reported illnesses in California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Listeria can grow even at low temperatures and can also can take three weeks or longer to make a person sick, so more cases may emerge in the coming weeks, officials said. Listeriosis causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults, according to the CDC, but it is particularly dangerous for older adults, people with weakened immune systems. In pregnant women, it can cause miscarriages, stillbirth and premature delivery. Pregnant women may experience only mild flu-like symptoms, said Dr. David Acheson, a former chief medical officer for the FDA who is now the managing director for food and import safety practice at Leavitt Partners, a firm which advises clients on health care and food safety. Listeria can be devastating to a fetus, he said, particularly in the second or third trimesters, so pregnant women who may have been exposed and have any flu-like symptoms should see a doctor. Symptoms can be more pronounced in the elderly or those with compromised immune systems, he said. About 1,600 people become seriously ill because of the bacteria each year, the CDC reports, and about 260 die.

1472,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man wounded Friday when a gunman opened fire at passing vehicles along a downtown street in Hollywood has died, a spokeswoman at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles said Monday. John Atterberry died shortly before 5 p.m. Monday, according to Simi Singer, the hospital spokeswoman. The music-industry executive was shot in the jaw at Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street. The gunman, 26-year-old Tyler Brehm, went on the rampage that ended with his being fatally shot by police, Los Angeles police spokeswoman Sgt. Mitzi Fierro has said. An amateur video captured the scene of Brehm walking down Sunset Boulevard wielding a handgun and firing at vehicles, seemingly at random. Brehm fired a ""significant number"" of rounds, police said. He then returned to an intersection, where he was confronted by a plainclothes police detective and an off-duty police officer working on a nearby movie set, officials said. ""At that point the police ordered him to drop his weapon and he pointed his gun at the police and an officer-involved shooting occurred,"" Fierro said. Brehm died later at a nearby hospital, according to a police statement. Christopher Johns recorded much of the incident from his apartment window and can be heard shouting at Brehm throughout. ""Why don't you come up here?"" he yelled, later telling CNN that he intended to distract the gunman. At one point, Brehm spoke with Johns, asking him for ammunition and to call an ambulance. Fierro said it appeared Johns could interact with the suspect without jeopardizing his safety. ""It appears from the video that he was able to distract the suspect and keep him from shooting at additional people before the police arrived,"" she said. Police have not indicated that they know Brehm's motive. Two others suffered minor injuries. Witnesses were stunned by the shooting spree. Amy Torgeson told CNN affiliate KABC that vehicles began ""swerving and braking,"" and she sought cover at a nearby bank. ""A car drove by and he just shot right into the car,"" Torgeson said. ""He was just shooting everywhere."" CNN's Regina Graham contributed to this report.","John Atterberry died around 5 p.m. Monday, a Cedars-Sinai spokeswoman says .

1473,"Moscow (CNN) -- Two policemen were killed by a suicide car bomber in Russia's North Caucasus republic of Dagestan, the Dagestani Interior Ministry said on its website Monday. The ministry said the officers were patrolling the town of Kizilyurt in a minivan around midnight when an unidentified bomber sitting in a parked Lada car set off an unidentified explosive device in his car as the police minivan was passing by. The explosion left a crater 1.5 meters (5 feet) wide and 15 centimeters (6 inches) deep, the ministry said. The police minivan was burned out, the ministry said. Dagestan has been hit by a series of deadly attacks recently, including fatal bombings and shootings. It is the largest and most volatile of the five Northern Caucasus regions. Rebels continue to stage frequent attacks on security forces, police and civilians. In August, the head of the Federal Security Service Alexandr Bortnikov told the Russian president that in the first six months of this year, 169 terrorist acts were committed, of which 110 took place in Dagestan. In recent years, Dagestan has faced ethnic friction, spillover from the discord in neighboring Chechnya and attacks on government officials by militant Islamists, the International Crisis Group has said.","The officers were on patrol when a car bomber detonated a device .

1474,"Miami (CNN) -- The 4-year-old girl sobbed as rescuers rushed her ashore. In the boat behind her, the faces of her fellow survivors were painted with ""a thousand-yard stare,"" one witness said Monday. That girl and three others spent 20 hours stranded in stormy water after their 22-foot boat capsized off the Florida Keys over the weekend. They were picked up Sunday afternoon by Coast Guard rescuers. A few hours earlier, David Jensen was maneuvering the Snap Shot, his fishing charter boat, from Duck Key to the open sea when he and others ""saw a big object floating in the distance."" ""The closer I got, I could see a guy waving,"" Jensen said. They found three men clinging to part of what had been their boat. One charter customer quickly jumped in to help, while others threw life jackets to the men, only one of which could muster the energy to swim over, Jensen said. Once aboard, a language barrier -- the rescued men were Spanish-speaking -- and raw emotions made it difficult to ascertain exactly what had happened. One who did speak English was very upset: ""He lost his mother,"" Jensen explained. Officer Robert Dube of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said Monday that a son had tried to hold onto his 79-year-old mother in the hours after their ship went down around noon Saturday. But she slipped away into the rough waters, Dube said, before rescuers could reach her. This victim, later identified as Zaida San Jurjo Gonzalez, and the men had clung to the capsized boat's hull. But four others -- three women and the young girl -- couldn't hold on, and drifted off, Jensen said, based on his conversations with the survivors and authorities. The charter boat captain contacted the Coast Guard after learning others were unaccounted for, and he took his boat out five miles in the direction where the four had drifted away. He saw no signs of them. But rescuers did come upon the four Sunday morning, bringing them aboard near Marathon, which is roughly halfway between Key Largo and Key West, according to a Coast Guard statement . Authorities later learned that the three women, wearing life jackets, had held tight to a floating cooler and took turns holding the girl through the afternoon, night and next morning. ""That definitely saved their lives,"" Dube told CNN. ""It could have been a lot worse situation."" Wayne Crosby of Captain Hook's Marina and Dive Center said he watched rescuers bring the four to a dock in Marathon on Sunday. They handed the girl off the boat first, he told CNN affiliate WSVN. ""They had her all wrapped up. ... She couldn't stop crying. She was panic-stricken,"" Crosby said. At the dock, rescuers scrambled to tend to all the victims. ""They just had that look on their face, like a thousand-yard stare,"" Crosby told WSVN. The group had suffered multiple jellyfish stings over the course of their ordeal, Dube said. And by Monday, the 4-year-old had been treated for mild hypothermia and exhaustion. But the wildlife officer added that, by then, she appeared to be ""in very good spirits."" Ernie Perroncello, owner and operator of Sea Tow in Marathon, said weather in the area Saturday when the boat went down was terrible. ""You can get yourself in trouble real quick "" on the area's water, said Perroncello, whose company salvaged the capsized boat.

1475,"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two airmen on a U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagle died when the plane crashed in eastern Afghanistan early Saturday, the U.S. military said. A U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagle similar to this one crashed Saturday in eastern Afghanistan. The two-man fighter went down while it was conducting military operations, another source, Lt. Col. Reid Christopherson, said earlier. ""At this time, we are very comfortable in stating there was no hostile fire in the incident,"" Christopherson said. He added that a board of officers will investigate the crash of the highly maneuverable, all-weather tactical fighter. In a news release, the military said the incident occurred at 3:15 a.m. Kabul time and also noted that there was no ""hostile fire."" ""We mourn the loss of these two airmen and our thoughts are with their families, loved ones and their unit,"" the news release said. ""Only after a deliberative and thorough investigation will we know what caused this event. "" A spokesman for the governor of Afghanistan's central Ghazni province, who goes by the single name Jihangir, confirmed that a U.S. plane crashed in Ghazni's Nawur district before dawn. ""The crash site was sealed off by coalition forces,"" Jihangir told CNN by telephone, ""Afghan police were not allowed to have access to this area."" The Afghan official said the plane crashed in Ghazni, some 160 kilometers west of the town of Ghazni, between the communities of Qaracha and Bahari. The jet crash comes in a bloody month in Afghanistan. July's toll of international military fatalities stands at 50, the highest tally so far, a CNN count of official statistics shows. CNN's Ivan Watson contributed to this report.","Air Force F-15 Eagle crash kills both crew members, U.S. military says .

1476,"(CNN) -- Most conservationists would agree that you should not interfere with mother nature. But there are exceptions to every rule. Staff and tourists at Kapani Safari Lodge in Zambia were caught by surprise when a mother and baby elephant became trapped in mud. Saying they couldn't just ""stand by and watch them slowly die,"" what ensued was a dramatic rescue. Together with the South Luangwa Conservation Society (SLCS) and the local wildlife authority, the team devised a plan to get the elephants out. The rest of the herd initially tried to help the screaming mother and baby escape, but they were stuck too deep. Team managers from the conservation society slipped a rope around the baby and after a few attempts managed to pull her out of the muddy pit. The team says it took a lot of coaxing to get her out and on her feet though, adding that she ""was terribly frightened and wouldn't leave her mum's side"". Getting the adult elephant out of the mud was a far more challenging task -- by the time the baby had been rescued, its mother was dehydrated and exhausted. But the SLCS team eventually pulled her out too, using a tractor and rope. Staff at Kapani Lodge say it was ""heart-warming to see how many local people joined in the efforts to free the two elephants... it was the happiest possible ending.""","Mother and baby elephant stuck in mud at game lodge in Zambia .

1477,"Penuelas, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- Jorelys Rivera, the 7-year-old girl who was abducted and killed early this month near her north Georgia home, was buried Tuesday in a service in this town on the southern coast of Puerto Rico. Hundreds of mourners filled the funeral home and spilled out the doors for the service. Afterward, the carriage holding holding her body was pulled by horses -- her favorite animal -- to the cemetery. The 1- to 2-kilometer (1-mile) route to the cemetery was lined with people, many of whom said they had not known the girl or her family, but were there simply because they had been moved by her story. Mayor Walter Torres paid the cost of the service. As a four-person group played traditional Puerto Rican and Christmas music, Jorelys' mother Joseline appeared calm and solemn.The girl's father, Ricardo Galarza, appeared disturbed and upset. He told CNN last week that he last saw his daughter two years ago when she visited for the summer. She was supposed to have returned for Christmas. The girl's maternal grandmother was barely able to speak and remain upright. Jorelys disappeared December 2 near a playground at a Canton, Georgia, apartment complex. Searchers found her body in a compactor-type trash bin there three days later. Authorities have accused 20-year-old Ryan Brunn -- a maintenance worker at the complex -- of killing her. Jorelys died of blunt force trauma to the head and was stabbed and sexually assaulted, according to authorities. A date for Brunn's arraignment has not been set. David Cannon Sr., one of Brunn's court-appointed attorneys, has said that his client will plead not guilty. On Sunday, Rivera told WAPA that if authorities have evidence showing Brunn killed her daughter, he should face the death penalty. ""The truth is I can't tell you if it was him or if it wasn't him, because I had never seen him before,"" she said.","Hundreds of mourners filled the funeral home in Puerto Rico .

1478,"Kennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) -- NASA launched its Ares I-X rocket Wednesday, after multiple delays over two days because of bad weather. The 327-foot rocket -- which NASA considers the world's largest -- took off at 11:30 a.m. ET, 30 minutes before a noon deadline for the launch. It rose about 24 miles. About two minutes after liftoff, the first-stage, reusable rocket booster fell into the Atlantic, where it was to be picked up by a ship. It was the first flight test for the Constellation Program, NASA's next-generation spacecraft and launch vehicle system. The rocket's launch is part of NASA's mission to someday return astronauts to the moon and later travel to Mars. NASA spokesman George Diller, who was moderating the launch preparations for broadcasters, communicated the frustration as launches were repeatedly called off with just minutes to go. After 11 a.m., it appeared there would be a narrow window for a liftoff, and a half-hour later the rocket roared skyward. ""I can't tell you how proud I am of all of you,"" Ed Mango, Ares I-X launch director, told engineers and others inside the center after the launch. ""That was just one of the most beautiful rocket launches I've ever seen."" ""It shows what we can do when we have a common goal."" As the clock ticked toward noon, NASA officials nervously awaited all-clears for technical items and a weather clearance from weather officer Kathy Winters who, time and again, said conditions were ""red,"" meaning a no-go. A reconnaissance plane was giving her frequent weather reports. She kept looking for a break in the high-level clouds.  ""It's a very dynamic situation,"" Winters said. Before the launch, the space agency had begun negotiating with the Air Force to see if a Thursday launch attempt was possible. Failing that, NASA couldn't have tried again until November 16. NASA's primary concern was the high-level, cold clouds that can cause triboelectrification, or the production of a kind of static electricity, similar to what happens when you walk across a carpet, then touch something. If static surrounds the rocket, it can interfere with radio signals sent by or to the rocket. The Constellation Program has been developing new vehicles to replace space shuttles, which will be phased out in 2010. If the program moves forward, the Orion capsule atop the Ares rocket will not be ready to take astronauts into space until at least 2015, leaving a gap of at least five years in which the only way the United States would be able to put humans in orbit would be by hitching a ride with the Russians. Part of the test rocket mission is for scientists to try out three massive main parachutes, measuring 150 feet in diameter and weighing one ton each -- the largest rocket parachutes ever manufactured. The parachutes are a primary element of the rocket's deceleration system, NASA says. After the rocket is successfully launched, the parachutes are to open at the same time, ""providing the drag necessary to slow the descent of the huge solid rocket motor for a soft landing in the ocean,"" the agency says on its Web site. The two parts of the rocket are to separate at about 130,000 feet. The top of the rocket, known as the upper stage, includes a mock Orion crew capsule and a launch abort system. The upper stage will continue its ascent until gravity forces its return to Earth, after which it will fall into the Atlantic Ocean. The launch comes at a critical time, when NASA is waiting for President Obama to decide future funding for the agency. An independent committee reviewing the future of space flight recently reported that the U.S. space program appears to be pursuing goals that exceed current funding. The committee also recommended to the White House that funding for NASA's under-construction international space station should be extended until 2020. CNN's Kim Segal and John Zarrella contributed to this report.","NEW: ""One of the most beautiful rocket launches I've ever seen,"" says launch director .

1479,"(CNN) -- The space shuttle Atlantis glided to a picture-perfect landing Friday morning under bright, sunny skies at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The seven-person crew returned after an 11-day mission to deliver key spare parts to prolong the life of the international space station. The original six-member crew, with flight engineer Nicole Stott -- who launched in August -- returned amid sunny, clear Florida weather. ""Couldn't have picked a clearer day,"" Cndr. Charles Hobaugh said as the shuttle approached the runway. Mission Control told Hobaugh that the landing was a ""picture-perfect end"" to the mission. ""Everybody, welcome back to Earth, especially you, Nicole,"" Mission Control said. Stott had spent 87 days on the international space station, according to NASA. About an hour after the shuttle landed, the crew transport vehicle moved alongside the orbiter access hatch on Atlantis' port side, NASA said on its Web site. With the crew hatch opened, the astronauts left the orbiter to enter the vehicle. It contains beds and comfortable seats so the astronauts can receive a brief medical checkup before they step onto the tarmac, NASA said. The crew's mission included three space walks and installation of two platforms to the station's backbone. The platforms will hold spare parts that will sustain station operations after the shuttles are discontinued. NASA said the parts the crew delivered will add years to the station's life after the space shuttle fleet is retired next year. Some of the parts are for systems that keep the station from overheating or tumbling through space, NASA said. During the mission, the crew celebrated Thanksgiving while they prepared for landing. They dined on smoked turkey, green beans, mushrooms, cornbread dressing and candied yams, according to NASA. Russia will take over supplying the international space station. On this mission, Atlantis also marked a 6 pound, 13 ounce development. Astronaut Randy Bresnik welcomed a daughter from space, the second time a baby has been born to a U.S. astronaut on a mission. Mike Fincke's daughter was born in June 2004 while he was aboard the international space station, NASA said.","NEW: Mission Control to crew: ""Everybody, welcome back to Earth""

1480,"(PEOPLE.com) -- After suffering the miscarriage of their 20th child, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar will hold a memorial service on Wednesday, December 14, for the baby girl they have named Jubilee Shalom Duggar. The reality TV stars of TLC's ""19 Kids and Counting"" had discovered on Thursday at a routine ultrasound appointment that their 20th child, due next April, no longer had a heartbeat. Advised by her doctor to let the miscarriage occur naturally, Michelle, 45, was being cared for at home by her family. Following the miscarriage late Sunday night, Michelle began to feel lightheaded and as a precaution was taken to the hospital, where she was kept for observation, according to a family spokesperson. Michelle is recovering well and expected to return home later on Monday, the spokesperson adds. RELATED: Michelle Duggar Resting at Home, Plans to Name Child . ""We have had many tears today,"" says Jim Bob Duggar, 46. ""This is life, and I understand that we are going though something that many others have. You think about the what-ifs, but God gives us strength to go on. We won't be able to see this child's life and the phases that we've seen for our other children, but we know we will see this child in heaven one day. We are thankful for each child, and we are blessed to have the children we have here and the ones we will meet someday in heaven."" Jubilee Duggar's memorial service will be for friends and Duggar family members, who on late Sunday already held a private service in their home. ""We would like to thank everyone for their prayers, emails and outpouring of love,"" Jim Bob wrote in a letter he shared with PEOPLE. ""As our whole family is grieving, we also know that God promises to work all things for good in our lives. Our prayer is that Jubilee's passing will help us all realize that this life is short, and our relationship with Jesus is the most important thing. He gives us a peace in our hearts as He guides us through whatever we might face."" Though the family is in mourning, Jim Bob says they are grateful for the health of youngest daughter, Josie, who turned 2 on December 10. Josie survived against all odds after being born at just 25 weeks and 1 lb., 6 oz. and has developed normally with no lasting impairments. ""We were looking forward to this birthday because it is a milestone for her,"" he says. ""It is wonderful that she is with us and doing so well.""

1481,"Washington (CNN) -- An engine problem forced passengers -- including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- to evacuate a United Airlines flight at Dulles International Airport on Wednesday, officials said. Flight attendants shouted ""everyone get out"" after passengers spotted smoke coming from the plane's right engine and notified the crew, according to one passenger who was onboard. Passengers slid down the plane's emergency slides onto the airport's tarmac, officials said. ""I am shaking ... People were screaming,"" passenger Jodi Gersh wrote in a Twitter post after evacuating. ""Attendants opened (the) rear door to see where smoke was coming from,"" she wrote in another post. ""They then very loudly started yelling 'everyone get out.' Very scary."" Ginsburg was on the flight and was not injured, a Supreme Court spokeswoman said. Passengers evacuated from the Boeing 757 onto the tarmac just after the aircraft left the gate, said Rob Yingling, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. There were 179 passengers and six crew members onboard, United spokesman Mike Trevino said. Yingling said an engine problem caused the evacuation. The Federal Aviation Administration said there was a report of a fire onboard. Trevino said the airline was investigating the incident, but did not confirm whether there had been an engine problem or a fire. Video from CNN affiliate WUSA showed firefighters at the scene. Flight 586 was scheduled to fly to San Francisco, Trevino said. Passengers will head to San Francisco on a different plane scheduled to leave Dulles later Wednesday, he said. Dulles is located in Chantilly, Virginia, about 25 miles from downtown Washington. CNN's Lindy Royce-Bartlett, Bill Mears and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I am shaking ...

1482,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's 77-year-old emperor was hospitalized on Sunday, several days after coming down with a fever, a spokesperson with the Imperial Household Agency said. Emperor Akihito, a ceremonial but revered figure in the Japan, was suffering from a worsening case of bronchitis and the fever he contracted Thursday, according to the spokesperson, who declined to be identified due to the agency's media protocol. ""He appears to be fatigued and has lost some resistance to fight against sickness,"" the spokesperson said. ""To be on the safe side, he was hospitalized (Sunday night) at University of Tokyo Hospital."" It is the emperor's second time in a hospital this year, after getting medical treatment in February for extensive tests of his coronary arteries. Japan's Cabinet on Sunday approved a measure to temporarily elevate Crown Prince Naruhito to the role of emperor and give him power over all the responsibilities that position entails, according to a person at the Cabinet office, who also was not named per policy. Akihito: The 125th Emperor of Japan . Born in Tokyo in December 1933 into a family that eventually consisted of seven children, Akihito became crown prince in 1952 -- the same year he enrolled at Gakushuin University, according to his official biography. Seven years later, he married then-crown princess, and now Empress Michiko, and together they raised three children. On January 7, 1989, following the death of his father Hirohito, Akihito became emperor. The position, per Japan's constitution, is defined as ""the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people."" That said, the office's involvement in day-to-day government affairs tends to be minimal. Yet Emperor Akihito broke from precedent following Japan's epic 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami earlier this year, when he gave a historic, televised speech. In it, he encouraged citizens to put forth their ""best effort to save all suffering people"" and he applauded his countrymen's handling of the crisis. ""I truly hope the victims of the disaster never give up hope, take care of themselves, and live strong for tomorrow,"" he said in a calm and poignant oration delivered from the Imperial Palace. ""Also, I want all citizens of Japan to remember everyone who has been affected by the devastation, not only today but for a long time afterwards -- and help with the recovery.""","Emperor Akihito, 77, came down with a fever Thursday, an imperial spokesperson says .

1483,"(CNN) -- Much-needed rain fell across drought-stricken Texas on Sunday, offering relief but no end to what's been one of the state's driest years on record. Some areas received more rain in a day than had fallen all summer. Waco, Texas, where temperatures hit at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit 78 days this year, received 5.83 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas got 1.37 inches of rain, while San Antonio received 3.06 inches -- a record for the date. The weather service forecast rainfall amounts over the central and southern Plains of 1-3 inches per hour, with totals of more than 10 inches possible in some places by Monday morning. ""This should put a significant dent in the ongoing severe drought over portions of the area, but this amount of rain in a short period of time could also lead to possible flash flooding across northern Texas and Oklahoma,"" the weather service said. It added that drought conditions are expected to persist because of the magnitude of the shortage. With much of the state in an exceptional drought, Texas has been scarred by one of the worst fire seasons in memory. Since wildfire season started in November, more than 3.8 million of the state's 167.5 million acres have burned in some 24,000 fires, according to the Texas Forest Service. Roughly 2,800 homes were destroyed. ""What the state needs is several widespread rainfall events over several months,"" the weather service said. Heavy rains and slippery field conditions at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington forced the postponement Sunday of the second game of the American League Championship Series. Weather permitting, the Texas Rangers and Detroit Tigers will make up the game Monday afternoon. CNN's Jacqui Jeras contributed to this report.","Some areas receive more rain in a day than they had all summer .

1484,"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- They left home with hope in their hearts, thousands of fans true to the Liverpool anthem, dreaming of reaching another Wembley FA Cup Final. The disaster at Hillsborough football stadium in 1989 resulted in the deaths of 96 football supporters. But what began as a day out in the spring sunshine 20 years ago ended as the darkest hour in the history of British football. I had settled into Row B Seat 2 of the press box in the south stand at Hillsborough, home to Sheffield Wednesday and neutral venue for the game. From there I would have had an uninterrupted view of the semifinal showdown between Liverpool and Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. Clough, one of the legends of the British game, had been denied an FA Cup Final with Forest a year earlier, when his side lost to Liverpool at the same stage of the competition and at the same venue. The atmosphere in the ground for the 1989 semifinal exploded as the teams emerged onto the pitch. But none of us was prepared for what was to follow. The match action lasted less than six minutes. I can't remember a single kick. What I do recall quite vividly are the scenes of distress, desperation and death at the Liverpool end that destroyed so many families and shocked the world. Looking to my left and behind Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar's goal, I was drawn to a huge mushroom-like effect among the crowd in the central standing enclosures around kick-off time.  See Liverpool players and fans paying tribute to victims of Hillsborough disaster » . The match had not long started when the first signs of a major problem surfaced. Fans began frantically attempting to climb over the perimeter fence to escape the crush at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. I didn't know it at the time, but the swell was the exit point of a tunnel that ran under the stand. Through it hundreds of Liverpool fans had attempted to make their way without realizing the two caged pens it led to were already overcrowded. Many had the life squeezed out of them in that tunnel. Others were trampled or crushed to death on the terraces. The lucky ones clambered to safety, many collapsing on the pitch. Some fans were hoisted up into the stand above by fellow supporters, but the main escape route was over the high perimeter fence and later through a small gate that was forced open as police -- who initially thought they were dealing with a pitch invasion -- recognized the true scale of the problem. Advertising boards were used as makeshift stretchers and some of those being carried away had their heads covered by coats. The Sheffield Wednesday gymnasium became a mortuary. The Liverpool end of the pitch resembled a casualty station with frantic efforts being made to treat the injured and save lives while others wandered aimlessly around the pitch in a daze. I will always remember the bid to revive one young fan in front of the main stand. Those efforts seemed to go on forever before finally hundreds of spectators let out a huge cheer as the lad at last showed some sign of life. I still wonder to this day whether or not he made it. Meanwhile I had an open phoneline to a copytaker at The Press Association and described those shocking events unfolding in front of me, including news of the first fatalities. For the second time in four years I had gone to cover a football match and ended up filing a disaster report. In 1985 I had been in Brussels with Liverpool to cover their European Cup final against Juventus, when 39 fans, mainly Italian, were killed at the Heysel stadium as a wall collapsed after trouble on the terraces. That match eventually went ahead after a delay of 85 minutes. Within hours of returning from Belgium, I was among a small group of football writers summoned to No. 10 Downing Street for a meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Mrs Thatcher planned draconian measures to combat what became known as the English disease, but it was the appalling events at Sheffield that finally became the catalyst for change. The Hillsborough tragedy was played out in full view of 53,000 spectators and TV cameras. People who came to watch a football match went home haunted by scenes of carnage and chaos that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Later, in an area beneath the empty south stand, FA chief executive Graham Kelly faced media at an impromptu press conference and expressed his shock, sadness and sorrow. Understandably, he didn't have all the answers as questions were fired his way. What led to the disaster is well documented. Lord Justice Taylor, a High Court judge commissioned by the government to produce a report, concluded that police operational errors were largely to blame for allowing the gates to be opened to relieve congestion outside the ground. Many questioned why the kickoff to the game had not been delayed. English football was quick to react with perimeter fences pulled, followed by the phased-in arrival of all-seater stadia. In the aftermath grieving fans turned Liverpool's Kop stand and the Anfield pitch into a shrine draped with thousands of scarves, flags and flowers. A permanent memorial to the victims was later erected adjacent to the Shankly Gates -- named after the club's most famous manager -- and which bear the title of the Reds' anthem: You'll Never Walk Alone. The oldest victim at Hillsborough was 67, the youngest 10-year-old Jon-Paul Gilhooley, a cousin of current Liverpool captain and England international Steven Gerrard. Gerrard was six weeks away from his ninth birthday at the time of tragedy. There is nothing Liverpool would want more than to mark the 20th anniversary season with at least one gleaming trophy. They did it in 1989, beating Forest when the semifinal was later replayed, then going on to defeat city rivals Everton after extra time at Wembley. On that occasion they returned home with hope in their hearts.","96 Liverpool fans died as a result of the Hillsborough disaster on April 15, 1989 .

1485,"(CNN) -- A major clean-up operation is underway along the north coast of New Zealand's North Island as debris and oil leaking from a cargo ship that ran aground on a reef wash ashore, officials say. The Rena, a Liberian-flagged vessel, struck the Astrolabe Reef, about 12 nautical miles off the city of Tauranga, last week. New Zealand's oil spill response agency, Maritime New Zealand (MNZ), estimates that as much as 300 tonnes of fuel oil has leaked from the vessel, which was carrying 1,700 cubic meters (450,000 gallons) of fuel. The country's environment minister, Nick Smith, has called the spill New Zealand's most significant maritime environmental disaster. As of Friday, clean-up teams collected 95.45 tonnes of solid waste and 6 tonnes of liquid waste from beaches in the Bay of Plenty, MNZ said. About 60 kilometers of coastline, from the towns of Maketu to Mount Maunganui, is contaminated with oil, the agency said. Pubic access to some waterfront areas has been restricted due to health concerns. ""We are now coordinating a team of around 1,000 people involved in operations on land, sea and air and covering areas like field operations, planning, logistics, wildlife recovery and community and iwi [indigenous Maori people] liaison,"" said National On Scene Commander Nick Quinn. MNZ said that 500 dead birds have been found following the oil spill. The agency said 140 people scoured the coast yesterday for wildlife affected by the spill and 51 oiled animals are being treated at a center that has been set up in Tauranga. A team has been established to capture seals and five of the animals are being kept in captivity. Greenpeace has expressed ""extreme concern"" about the spill and urged the government to avoid using further toxic dispersants. ""This is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea,"" the organization's Steve Abel said. ""Even a slow and relatively accessible oil spill like this one has clearly stretched New Zealand's response capability to its limits,"" he said. ""It is also a potential disaster for the blue whales and dolphins presently calving in the area, as well as numerous other marine species."" MNZ said that 88 containers had fallen off the ship, 20 of which have washed ashore. Due to the hazard the containers pose to shipping, the agency said navigational warnings had been issued and major maritime traffic has been re-routed. The Rena has suffered substantial structural failure and there is a concern that the stern of the vessel may break up, MNZ said. Salvage teams have three tugs mobilized either to hold the stern on the reef while efforts continue to remove oil from the ship, or to tow the stern to shallow water to extract the oil, the agency said. Containers remaining on the vessel continue to move, making it dangerous for salvage crews to work on board. Salvors have worked to build a platform to attach to the side of the vessel today to be used to assist fuel recovery operations, MNZ said. The ship's second officer appeared in Tauranga District Court yesterday to face a charge of ""operating a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk,"" MNZ said. The Rena's captain was remanded on bail on Wednesday on the same charge, on the condition he surrender his passport. His name has not been released. If convicted, they face a maximum fine of $7,800, or up to 12 months imprisonment.

1486,"(CNN) -- A ""significant"" amount of oil is leaking from a container ship that ran aground on a reef off the pristine coast of New Zealand's North Island, officials said Tuesday. New Zealand's oil spill response agency, Maritime New Zealand (MNZ), said in a statement that the ship has sustained ""some damage from current movement and there is a significant amount of oil leaking from the vessel."" MNZ estimates that 130-350 tonnes of oil have leaked from the vessel, which was carrying 1,700 cubic meters (450,000 gallons) of fuel. The agency said that the vessel was still intact, but was being moved around by strong seas. Clumps of oil from the leaking ship have been found on Mount Maunganui beach in the Bay of Plenty. MNZ is advising people to avoid the beach for health reasons. Oil began leaking from the Rena, a Liberian-flagged vessel, after it struck the Astrolabe Reef, about 12 nautical miles off the coast of Tauranga, on the North Island, on Wednesday, creating a five-km (three-mile) slick. Efforts to recover oil from the grounded ship, now heading south down the coast, are being hampered by high winds and strong swells. Approximately 10 tonnes of fuel oil was transferred to tanks on board a barge before the recovery operation was suspended on Monday. MNZ said dispersants are being tested on the oil that has leaked. However, there are sea swells of up to four meters, which can make it difficult for the dispersant to work. Worsening weather prompted the ship's crew to be evacuated as a precautionary measure after a mayday call was made on Tuesday. Naval architects and salvage experts on board the Rena are monitoring the vessel and have placed sensors to provide advance warning should the ship's structure come under too much stress. MNZ has established a one-kilometer maritime exclusion zone around the ship due to the health risk posed by the oil spill. National On-Scene Commander Rob Service said the operation to remove the oil from the ship, led by Svitzer Salvage, would be complex. ""There is no way of doing this quickly,"" he said. A rescue center has been set up in the city of Tauranga to clean oil from animals affected by the spill and MNZ has 12 teams working to assist oiled wildlife. Nine birds have been recovered -- seven little blue penguins and two shags, the agency said. About 300 defense force personnel are on standby for a shore cleanup if needed, the agency said. Officials fear the stricken ship may spill additional oil as its condition deteriorates. ""I think we'd expect that at some point to have further problems and potentially even break up,"" Transport Minister Steven Joyce told broadcaster TVNZ. Greenpeace expressed ""extreme concern"" about the spill and urged the government to avoid using further toxic dispersants. ""This is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea,"" the organization's Steve Abel said. ""Even a slow, and relatively accessible oil spill like this one has clearly stretched New Zealand's response capability to its limits. ""It is also a potential disaster for the blue whales and dolphins presently calving in the area, as well as numerous other marine species."" New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said two inquiries had been launched into the incident to discover how the ship hit the reef. ""This is a very large ship, that in calm waters has hit an extremely well documented reef,"" he told Television New Zealand. ""Some serious questions need to be answered about why that happened and who is responsible,"" he said.

1487,"(CNN) -- A gunman carrying a variant of an AK-47 rifle opened fire on uniformed Nevada National Guard members having breakfast at a Carson City, Nevada, restaurant, killing two of them and injuring three, officials said Tuesday. A civilian woman in the line of fire also died and five others were injured in the mass shooting at an IHOP restaurant, officials said. The attacker died later of a self-inflicted wound. The FBI said there was no indication of terrorism. Authorities said they had not determined a clear motive. ""To say that he was targeting before he came into the restaurant those military persons, we have not been able to establish,"" said Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong. ""Clearly, the fact that five of the 11 were military draws a concern by us."" The suspected gunman was identified as Eduardo Sencion, 32, who lived in Carson City and worked at a family business in South Lake Tahoe, California, authorities said. ""There was no indication he knew anyone in the restaurant,"" said Michael West, supervisory special agent with the FBI. Witnesses indicated Sencion said something while inside the IHOP, West said . Sencion had no previous criminal record on file but his family indicated he may have had mental health issues, Furlong told reporters. He was at the family business Monday night and spent the night in Carson City, officials said. Family members reported ""no unusual activity."" The AK-47 was recovered and authorities will determine whether it was an automatic, Furlong said. An empty 30-round gun magazine and two other gun magazines were recovered. A pistol and assault rifle were found in or near a vehicle, the sheriff said. The shooting began shortly before 9 a.m., according to Furlong. When authorities arrived, those who called in the incident identified the shooting suspect as a man lying wounded in the parking lot between two vehicles. The suspect had continued firing in the parking lot after leaving the restaurant, Furlong said. One individual was wounded outside. Steven Martin, a witness, told CNN Reno affiliate KRNV that he ran to see if he could help after he heard shots being fired. ""There was blood everywhere; broken glass everywhere. It was just a war zone down there,"" he said. A blue minivan registered to the suspect's brother was being studied, Furlong said. Chuck Allen with the Nevada Highway Patrol said officials were taking precautions in case military personnel were being targeted. ""When you have people in uniform randomly targeted ... we take that seriously,"" Allen said. The shooting took place just a few miles from the Nevada National Guard state headquarters in Carson City. The two deceased Guard members were men. Two of the wounded Guard members were women. Guard spokeswoman Maj. April Conway said officials will ""ensure we do everything possible to take care of our families and support our Guardsmen.""","NEW: FBI says no indication of terrorism .

1489,"(CNN) -- At least two bombs were dropped near the Yida refugee camp in South Sudan, resulting in an undetermined number of casualties, the spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Thursday. ""We are very concerned that these bombs were dropped in an area where there are thousands of refugees who have gathered after fleeing the violence in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""It is essential that both parties immediately take all steps to protect civilian lives."" In Washington, the office of the White House press secretary said in a statement that the United States ""strongly condemns the aerial bombardment by the Sudan Armed Forces of the town of Yida,"" where more than 20,000 refugees who have fled conflict in the Sudanese state of Southern Kordofan are living. The Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile State and Nuba Mountain regions straddle Sudan and South Sudan's geographical and political lines. Although these territories are geographically part of Sudan, its population has faced ""exclusion, marginalization and discriminatory practices that have resulted in their opposition to the Sudanese government,"" according to the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""This bombing of civilians and humanitarian workers is an outrageous act, and those responsible must be held accountable for their actions,"" the statement said. The attack follows other bombardments by the Sudan Armed Forces on November 8 near the border that increase the potential for confrontation between Sudan and South Sudan, it said. ""The United States demands the Government of Sudan halt aerial bombardments immediately,"" the statement said. ""We urge the Government of South Sudan to exercise restraint in responding to this provocation to prevent further escalation of hostilities."" It called for a resumption of negotiations by the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North. President H.E. Saliva Kiir Mayardit has said he will not support armed opposition forces fighting against the government of Sudan, the South Sudan government website said. Kiir said Sudan was threatening the sovereignty of South Sudan ""through military invasion."" Liberation army members have clashed with the military of South Sudan, which separated from Sudan and became independent in July. Led by former officers of the southern army that fought neighboring Sudan in a 22-year civil war, the militias have taken up arms against their former comrades and become a challenge for the world's newest nation.","NEW: South Sudan president accuses Sudan of ""military invasion""

1490,"Beijing (CNN) -- A train collision in a tunnel in Shanghai's subway Line 10 last month was caused by human error, said state media, with 12 people disciplined over the incident. Xinhua News Agency, quoting a report released by the investigation team, reported that Tang Zhihua, chief dispatcher of the Line 10 operation control center, was removed from his post. Eleven other managers and workers of the operation control and power supply sections also received penalties, including job reassignment and demotions. The two subway trains collided on September 27 in downtown Shanghai, injuring 295 passengers, 70 of whom are still receiving treatment in hospital, according to the report. ""The signal system failed to operate because of power failure. The dispatchers issued a number of erroneous orders which finally led to the crash,"" Xinhua added. The accident happened as concerns and criticism mount over China's railway safety and its fast development of rail systems. On July 23, two high-speed trains crashed in China's coastal Zhejiang province, leaving 39 dead and 192 injured, making it one of China's deadliest rail accidents in recent years.","State media: Shanghai's subway Line 10 accident was caused by human error .

1491,"(CNN) -- Flooding caused by monsoon rains and swollen rivers has ravaged Thailand, affecting more than 9.5 million people nationwide. More than 380 people have died, and the overall damage is an estimated $6 billion dollars, the Thai Finance Ministry says. It is the worst flooding to hit the country in half a century, according to the Thai government. As the murky waters rise, so do health concerns. Charities working in the country predict water- and insect-borne illnesses like dengue fever and malaria will spike in the coming weeks. Relief organizations are on the ground providing shelter, supplies and medical aid to flood victims, and there are ways you can help. World Vision is passing out emergency relief kits and hygiene supplies to people living in highly affected areas. Mosquito nets are being distributed to help minimize the spread of insect-borne diseases as the waters crest. The orgnization is constructing safe places for children to play away from dangerous floodwater. At these ""Child-Friendly Spaces,"" kids can also participate in activities to help them cope with the trauma of this experience.

1492,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Journalists got their first ground-level glance Saturday around Japan's stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility -- eying shells of reactor buildings, tons of contaminated water and workers scurrying still to mitigate damage from a crisis that began eight months ago. An epic 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami March 11 wreaked havoc around Japan, killing more than 15,000 people. While many of those died instantly, the East Asian nation was on edge for weeks as utility and government employees scrambled to prevent a worsening nuclear catastrophe at the Daiichi plant, located about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of Tokyo. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency eventually categorized the accident as a level-7 event on the international scale for nuclear disasters -- the highest level -- putting it on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. It took months, but the Tokyo Electric Power Company (the plant's operator) eventually indicated that its workers were gaining control in the crisis. Throughout the summer and fall, there were no longer reports of explosions, nor stories about new leaks of radioactive material into the ground and sea. But the facility still remained off-limits to reporters and, for a 20-kilometer radius around the plant, to the general public due to the continued high levels of radiation and ongoing efforts to prevent yet more blasts and leaks. That temporarily changed Saturday, when about three dozen journalists traveled by bus through abandoned towns en route to the nuclear facility. They passed, for instance, withered plants at an abandoned nursery, a shattered car dealership and a gas station that had been taken over by crows. Radiation readings rose steadily as they neared the plant, including 6.7 microsieverts in Okuma. There, those on board put on respirator masks, adding to an ensemble of a protective suit, two pairs of gloves, two sets of plastic booties over their shoes and a radiation detector. At the plant's gate, the radiation reading was 20 microsieverts. The reading is still well below the threshold to mandate an immediate health risk -- 1,000 microsieverts equals 1 millisievert, and South Carolina-based medical physicist G. Donald Frey previously told CNN that radiation workers in the U.S. typically aim to be exposed to less than 5 millisieverts per year. Yet it was the cumulative effect that has prompted the continued evacuations of thousands around the Fukushima Daiichi facility. A half-dozen large cranes dominated the skyline inside the gates, while the grounds were pockmarked with vessels containing what the Tokyo Electric Power Company has said is 90,000 tons of water laced with radiation. They were visible in tanks that filled a field, as well as dozens of large, four-story tall silver tanks filled with tainted seawater. U.S., French and Japanese flags hung near a water decontamination facility, which appeared as a cluster of white tents surrounded by black sand bags. The presence of toxins didn't appear to prevent pine trees from standing, and seemingly thriving, all around the facility. Last spring was marked by regular reports of explosions, leaks and other problems at the plant. Those accounts, and radiation readings, in June led Japan's Nuclear Emergency Response Headquarters to confirm that three reactors -- Nos. 1, 2 and 3 -- had experienced full meltdowns. A meltdown is a catastrophic failure of the reactor core, with a potential for widespread radiation release. The damage became starkly evident the closer one got to the heart of the nuclear facility. From afar, a new structure surrounded the No. 1 reactor building, which had lost its roof due to a massive hydrogen explosion related to overheating the day after the quake. No. 2 appeared to be intact, painted blue and white, despite a reported hydrogen detonation on March 15. The No. 3 building, meanwhile, had been diminished to a skeletal concrete frame and large pile of rubble, which crews were cleaning up with cranes ahead of it being covered by its own structure. And the No. 4 building -- whose reactor was inactive at the time of the tsunami -- also had significant damage, with one side entirely blown out, exposing the nuclear spent fuel pool. Crumpled trucks and cars, twisted metal, a gutted office building and a huge dented storage tank were visible at the base of the reactor buildings, where radiation readings stood at 1,000 microsieverts (or 1 millisievert) per hour. Some of the debris resembled what swept up elsewhere in Japan by the tsunami, while others -- like three white cars, with Tokyo Electric markings -- were more distinct to the facility. Around the plant, crows and dragonflies fluttered in the disarray. So, too, did scores of the 3,200 workers that Tokyo Electric says usually work daily at the plant. They included workers building water tanks, operating cranes, entering buildings used to store highly radioactive waste, and manning the facility's tightly contained disaster center. The challenges notwithstanding, Tokyo Electric spokesman Tetsuya Terasawa insisted vast progress has been made in recent months. He said that temperatures at the three most damaged reactors (Nos. 1, 2 and 3) were below 100 degrees Celsius, or the boiling point, a critical measure. All elements of the nuclear cooling system were perched on grounds 30 meters above the reactors, well out of the reach of any future tsunami, according to Terasawa. Addressing Fukushima Daiichi workers, Goshi Hosono -- the Japanese government's nuclear crisis manager -- said he feels relieved that the facility is becoming increasingly stable. ""Every time I come back, I feel conditions have improved. This is due to your hard work,"" Hosono said. The decommissions of Fukushima Daiichi's first four reactors will likely take more than 30 years to complete, according to a draft report released late last month by Japan's Atomic Energy Commission. The report indicated that nuclear fuel should begin to be removed by the end of 2021 -- a key, but hardly the last phase in a clean-up effort that is expected to continue for another two decades beyond that. Masao Yoshida, the man in charge of the plant, said that all the reactors have stabilized and predicted that Tokyo Electric was on track to have a cold shutdown by year's end. But he conceded that the danger is still far from over -- especially for the thousands still toiling to bring this nuclear nightmare to an end. ""Even saying it's stabilized doesn't mean that it is extremely safe,"" said Yoshida. ""When working, the radiation remains high. So when it comes to working every day, there is still danger.""","Journalists haven't been to the Fukushima Daiichi plant since the March 11 quake .

1493,"(CNN) -- Capt. Tadeusz Wrona still has trouble sleeping. The night after executing a spectacular belly landing in Poland, the veteran pilot tossed and turned until 4 a.m. The phone kept ringing, he told Polish media, and he kept reliving the chilling moments when his crew and passengers came close to a disaster. Now basking in his nation's adoration and fielding countless interview requests, Wrona is resting even less, he said with a weary smile. Wrona, who has worked for LOT Polish Airlines for 20 years, was at the controls of a Boeing 767 en route from Newark, New Jersey, to Warsaw on Tuesday when he realized there was a problem with the landing gear. When the second attempt to open it failed, he knew that everyone on board -- 220 passengers and 11 crew -- was in danger. ""I've maybe flown this plane 500 times, and the landing gear deployed every time,"" Wrona said during a news conference in Warsaw on Wednesday. ""I never had any trouble flying Boeing."" Aware of comparisons to the 2009 ""Miracle on the Hudson,"" when Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed a plane in New York's Hudson River after a flock of geese damaged both of the aircraft's engines, Wrona pointed out that his situation was less dire. Both of his engines were working fine and there was time to prepare. After notifying Warsaw's airport that there might be an emergency landing, the crew had time to perform checks and various functions, Wrona said. They circled the city to burn off excess fuel. While the crew reviewed the procedure in the cockpit, the flight attendants prepared the cabin, instructing passengers that they would have to evacuate as soon as the plane stopped on the ground. The autopilot helped the crew guide the plane until about two minutes before landing, Wrona said. That's when he took manual control. ""We rested the plane on three points: two engines plus the rear portion of the fuselage,"" Wrona said. ""We tried to do it delicately, and we were successful."" There was less noise during the belly landing than a normal touch down, which shocked Wrona. It was just quiet, he recalled. Wrona, who has been dubbed the Polish version of Sullenberger, was praised by the original ""miracle"" pilot. ""The captain and the crew obviously did a great job,"" Sullenberger told CNN. ""It definitely requires skill to do this well, and from all reports and from watching the video, it looked like it was done very, very well."" But for Wrona, there were still tense moments ahead. ""When the plane stopped on the runway, I wasn't sure whether everyone was safe, because smoke appeared,"" he recalled. (Wind had blown the smoke caused by the friction of the landing toward the cockpit.) ""I finally felt full relief only when the purser reported that the cabin was empty."" Everyone got out safe and unhurt. Like Sullenberger, Wrona is now grappling with sudden fame and the gratitude of hundreds of families. He's a Facebook star, with several fan pages established in his honor. One page has more than 33,000 followers leaving messages of praise and adulation. But Wrona insists it's too much to call him a national hero. ""I am convinced that all of us who work for LOT would do the exact same thing, and it would end in the same way, because we train for such situations on simulators,"" he said. Wrona is fully prepared to return to his duties as pilot, he said. In fact, his schedule -- prepared before the incident -- has him flying to Hanoi, Vietnam, on Saturday. He's not sure whether the commission investigating the emergency landing will let him go. Wrona's wife and two adult children beamed when they were interviewed by Polish media on Thursday. Marzena Wrona found out about her husband's troubled flight on television while the plane was still circling Warsaw and raced to the airport to watch the emergency landing, she told the program DzieÅ„ Dobry TVN. But she had to turn back when authorities closed off many streets leading to the airport as a safety precaution. When she got back home, the plane had already landed. ""I knew the landing would be successful because I couldn't imagine otherwise,"" Wrona's wife said.","Pilot who executed a textbook belly landing in Poland is being hailed as national hero .

The 24-year-old was born in Cattolica on the Adriatic Riviera, less than five miles from the Misano World Circuit, which will now bear his name. The board of directors of the circuit voted unanimously for the change following the tragic accident at the Sepang International circuit on October 23 which claimed Simoncelli's life. ""We owe it to the memory of Sic (Simoncelli's nickname),"" Lucas Colaiacovo, the circuit's vice president was quoted on its official website. ""We owe it to his family, to the hundreds of thousands of fans who admired his courage and humanity, all of the individuals in the sporting world and media who support this spontaneous and moving proposal. ""We are pleased and proud to associate the Misano circuit with Marco Simoncelli, a champion in sport and in life."" The circuit added that it would not use Simoncelli's name for any commercial activities. Meanwhile, the MotoGP series has moved to the Spanish port city of Valencia for the first race since Simoncelli's fatal accident. His San Carlo Honda Gresini team are taking part in the final round of the world championship in his honor, but it was newly-crowned champion Casey Stoner on his Repsol Honda who set the fastest lap in first practice Friday. Suzuki's Alvaro Bautista led a wet second session with a time of one minute 47.975 secs, two seconds slower than Stoner's earlier benchmark. It was marked by a series of crashes, one of them involving Simoncelli's former teammate Hiroshi Aoyama, but he escaped unhurt.","The Misano World Circuit is to be renamed after Marco Simoncelli .

1495,"(CNN) -- Unlike many of Thailand's flood-ravaged zones in the central plains, Bangkok residents have been given the rare luxury of time -- a window of at least two days to prepare for what officials warn could be the worst flooding the city has seen in decades. Scenes vary dramatically in the city, with life carrying on as usual for many while others scramble to protect their possessions from the expected deluge that will hit as waters from the flooded central plains rush in. Gallery: Bracing for Bangkok floods . Outside homes, businesses and schools in low-lying areas of Bangkok that the government has warned are at risk of being worst hit, people can be seen erecting flood walls out of sandbags to safeguard against the incoming waters. Others are simply moving valuables to higher ground. For some residents, it's too late. Rising water levels on the Chao Phraya River and city canals have left many restaurants, shops and homes flooded, while public piers are covered in makeshift walkways and sandbags to keep ferry passengers dry. ""Our homes have been flooded for two weeks,"" says Khun Lek, 76, who lives in Bangkok's riverside Wat Tewarat community near Sanghee Bridge. ""Every year it's like this. The government comes to check on things and tries to help by building elevated paths for us. But we don't need much help ... we're used to this. Not like the people in Ayutthaya. If the floods move in, all we can do is move out to the road."" At Bangkok's Boon Chuay Muay Thai gym, fighter Jaroensak Sorwapin says they've been dealing with flood waters for a month. ""We can't fight as the water is bad for the skin on our feet, while jogging is impossible in the neighborhood, so we have to travel to another part of the city. The gym is losing money too as we used to get foreign boxers coming to train, but they've stopped coming."" At city supermarkets, many Bangkokians have been stocking up on water and food over the last few days as a precaution should flooded streets block access to shops, though the city's governor has told media there's no need to panic. ""Discount stores crowded with people stockpiling dried food and water in the face of unprecedented floods threatening to rage,"" said Twitter user KimEkkanant. The governor's suggestion is difficult for many to follow given the thousands of images Bangkok residents are seeing in the media of their fellow Thais suffering in nearby provinces like the former ancient capital Ayutthaya, where residents have had their livelihoods destroyed by the floods. Yet it is these images of hardship that are prompting some Bangkokians to join forces to help those affected by the floods in other parts of the country, with many using Facebook and Twitter to organize supply drives, fundraising events and spread news on how people can help. ""In two hours time our community raised enough money for 69 boats! Only 31 until we reach our target of 100!"" tweeted Bangkok's NIST International School. As was the case with the 2010 protests and eventual government crackdown, social media is indeed playing a key role in spreading information on the latest Thailand flood news. Many Twitter users are simply choosing to vent their frustration at the uncertainty, wondering if and when their homes will be hit. Others are sharing personal photos of flooded neighborhoods and rising water levels. Overall though, little has changed in the city as it waits for the expected floods to hit. In many parts of Bangkok, where the floods are expected to have a minimal impact, life is continuing as normal as people go about their daily lives. The government has dismissed calls to declare a state of emergency and issue a special holiday decree for Bangkok, so businesses and government offices remain open and public transportation is running. Major events are also going on as planned, including Tuesday afternoon's World Cup qualifier match between Thailand and Saudi Arabia at Bangkok's Ratchamangala Stadium. In terms of preparation, government workers have reportedly been told by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra they have two days to build three major flood barricades before runoff from the north reaches Bangkok. Monsoon rains and unusually high ocean tides are expected to worsen the situation between October 13-17 and October 26-31, impacting the flow of water from the Chao Phraya River into the Gulf of Thailand. Bangkok has set up a 24-hour flood relief operation center at Don Mueang Airport and prepared nearly 200 shelters to handle possible evacuations. © 2011 Cable News Network Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

1496,"(CNN) -- Volcanologists in the Philippines are closely monitoring a volcano on Luzon Island close to the capital, Manila, after a sudden spike in seismic activity. Twenty one volcanic earthquakes were recorded at Taal Volcano from Sunday 8 a.m. to Monday 8 a.m. One of the earthquakes was felt by local residents in Brgy Calauit at the southeast side of the island. Scientists at the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) say the quakes are an indication that magma is moving towards Taal's surface. The main crater lake has been heating up since January. PHIVOLCS Science Research Specialist Alex Ramos told CNN that scientists have seen ""a slight intensification of steaming in the main crater lake."" He said emissions of carbon dioxide have risen from 1,875 tons per day in February to 4,670 tons at the end of March. PHIVOLCS has raised its five step alert level to 2 around Taal and is warning people not to go near the crater lake or main Daang Kastila Trail due to the high concentration of toxic gases and a risk of steam explosions. The popular tourist attraction is 65 kilometres (40 miles) south of the Manila. An estimated 7,000 people live on the volcanic island which last erupted in 1977.

1497,"(CNN) -- Philippines authorities Tuesday started evacuating about 50,000 people living around the island nation's most active volcano after it oozed fiery lava and belched clouds of ash. A large-scale eruption was forecast as imminent. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology raised the alert level up a notch on Monday night to level 3. Scientist Alex Baloloy told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) that under level 3, ""a full-blown eruption is expected to take place within weeks to days."" He said seismic instruments detected 83 volcanic quakes, a majority of which were tremors associated with rockfalls. People in Albay province, about 466 kilometers (290 miles) south of the capital, Manila, flocked to town centers to catch a glimpse of glowing lava cascading down the slopes of Mayon. The volcanic mountain soars 2,464 meters (8,077 feet) into the sky and has erupted 49 times since the first documented eruption in 1616. Ash fell on the town of Guinabatan, prompting its mayor to predict an unwanted sort of white Christmas, PNA said. Provincial Gov. Joey Salceda ordered mandatory evacuation for residents of 45 towns and cities within a radius of 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) around Mayon, including Legazpi, Ligao, Tabaco, Daraga, Camalig, Guinobatan, Malilipot and Santo Domingo. The Albay Public Safety Emergency and Management Office said 9,946 families or 47,285 people were expected to be moved to safer ground within 72 hours, PNA reported. Salceda, who canceled a planned trip to Denmark for the global climate conference in Copenhagen, said he will meet with the provincial disaster coordinating council Tuesday to discuss emergency measures in case of an eruption, according to PNA. The Philippines is situated in the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Mayon's most violent eruption, in 1814, killed more than 1,200 people and devastated several towns. Its last major eruption was in 1993. Since then, it has emitted ash and spewed lava but remained restless.","Scientists: Full-blown eruption is expected to take place within weeks to days .

1498,"(CNN) -- Oklahoma State University women's basketball coach Kurt Budke and assistant coach Miranda Serna were killed when their plane crashed on the way to a recruiting trip in Arkansas, university officials said Friday. Former Oklahoma state Sen. Olin Branstetter and his wife, Paula, also died in the crash Thursday, university spokesman Gary Schutt said. ""It's a terribly sad day,"" he said. The crash occurred in Perry County, Arkansas, leaving no survivors. The plane, a Piper Cherokee PA-28, according to FAA records, crashed under ""unknown circumstances"" in a wooded area about four miles south of Perryville, Arkansas, about 4:30 p.m. CT on Thursday, agency spokesman Lynn Lunsford said Friday. No additional information about the crash was immediately available. The National Transportation Safety Board has sent investigators to the crash site, the agency said Friday. Budke and Serna were on a recruiting trip to Little Rock, Arkansas, the university said. ""For any coaching community to lose bright stars like Kurt and Miranda is tragic,"" NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement. ""This is a profound loss for the Oklahoma State women's basketball family, the entire university and future women's basketball players as well."" University officials credited Budke for turning the school's women's basketball program around, culminating with a top-10 national ranking and an appearance in the second round of the NCAA tournament last season. He was in his seventh season with the school. ""Kurt was an exemplary leader and a man of character who had a profound impact on his student-athletes,"" Oklahoma State President Burns Hargis said. ""He was an outstanding coach and a wonderful person. We send our deepest sympathies to his wife, Shelley, and their children, Sara, Alex and Brett."" Serna was also in her seventh season with OSU after coming to the school to work for Budke from Louisana Tech, where they both previously worked. She served as the program's recruiting coordinator, according to the school. Hargis called her ""an up-and-coming coach and an outstanding role model for our young ladies."" ""Its our worst nightmare,"" he added. The school called off games scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, and grief counselors were on hand for athletes and staff, the university said. Jim Littell, the team's associate head coach, will take over as interim head coach, according to Mike Holder, OSU vice president for athletics. The crash is the second fatal plane crash to strike the OSU basketball program in nearly 11 years. Ten people, eight of them associated with the university's men's basketball program, died when their plane crashed in a Colorado snowstorm on January 28, 2001.","Plane crash kills two OSU women's basketball coaches, ex-state senator and his wife .

1499,"Berlin (CNN) -- At least seven homemade explosives have been found along Berlin's railways within the last three days, police said Wednesday, severely disrupting traffic on several lines. Two of the devices have exploded -- one Monday and one on Wednesday, authorities said, but nobody was killed or injured in the blasts. Monday's explosion occurred next to a railway link between Hamburg and Berlin. The damage has not yet been repaired, authorities said. Since Monday, at least 2,000 trains have been delayed due to the attacks, a spokesman for Deutsche Bahn told CNN Wednesday. Another arson attempt -- this one on BerlinÂ´s central train station -- failed Monday because officials discovered the device before it exploded. ""The German national rail company Deutsche Bahn has become the victim of extremists. Nevertheless, our controls have been successful,"" said Gerd Neubeck, senior manager of the companyÂ´s security department, in a written statement Tuesday. Deutsche Bahn is offering a 100,000 euro (U.S. $138,120) reward for information leading to the arrests of those behind the blasts, according to a statement from the company. A group called the ""Hekla Welcome Committee-Initiative for More Social Eruptions"" has claimed responsibility for the explosions. ""This morning we slowed down the German capital and its function as a global player in the export of armaments,"" said a statement from the group released Monday on a leftist website. However, the group said it is not acting ""with the intention to endanger somebody's life."" The group blames GermanyÂ´s involvement in the Afghan war for the attacks. ""German soldiers kill in different parts of the world. For 10 years, the German armed forces are at war in Afghanistan -- without the agreement of the German people,"" Hekla said. At the beginning of October, a poll by the opinion research institute YouGov showed that two-thirds of all Germans do not believe in a successful military operation in Afghanistan anymore. The alleged attackers also demanded the release of U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning from jail and criticized U.S. military actions all over the world. Manning is accused of leaking thousands of classified U.S. military and State Department documents to the WikiLeaks website. The incendiary devices found in the past few days were filled with fluid and usually placed on cables, officials said. An investigation by the regional German police agency Landeskriminalamt is under way. ""I have ordered an immediate increase in police patrols around Berlin,"" German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said in a statement Wednesday. Sources from Germany's Office for the Protection of the Constitution told CNN Wednesday that the Hekla Welcome Committee was previously unknown to authorities. The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. One source said German railways are a common target of leftist extremists. In May, a homemade explosive device hidden next to an important railway hub in the city's east caused massive delays. In the 1970s, the leftist Red Army Faction terrorized Germany through bank robberies, kidnappings and assassinations. Its members were accused in more than 30 deaths.","NEW: Germany's railway operator is offering a reward for information in the case .

1500,"Beijing (CNN) -- Money rewards are coming in for a woman who rescued a bleeding toddler left for dead last week by multiple passersby in southern China. Two hit-and-run drivers rammed into Wang Yue, 2, one after another, as she walked on a narrrow street in Foshan. More than a dozen people walked, cycled or drove past as she lay bleeding in a busy market, sparking a global outcry on the state of morality in a fast-changing society. Wang is in critical condition, her brain showing little activity despite earlier subtle movements in the lower body, said her mother, Qu Feifei. But despite the many villains in the story, it has also turned the spotlight on an unlikely hero: A 58-year-old scavenger. In the video that has sparked outrage globally, Chen Xianmei moves the baby to safety, becoming an instant symbol of understated decency in a nation analysts say is obsessed with climbing the economic ladder. ""I didn't think of anything at the time,"" Chen said Sunday. ""I just wanted to save the girl."" Two government offices in Guangdong province, where the hit-and-run occurred, offered the Good Samaritan a total of 20,000 yuan (US $3,135), according to state-run Xinhua news agency. Wang's mother has said she does not understand the behavior of the passersby, but wants to focus on the positive. ""Granny Chen represents the best of human nature,"" she said of her daughter's rescuer. ""It's the nicest and most natural side of us."" On Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, the story continued to be the No. 1 topic after generating more than 4.5 million posts along with a ""stop apathy"" online campaign. As the outrage over morality continues, a steady procession of well-wishers pours in, offering gifts, money and support to the toddler's family.","Two hit-and-run drivers rammed into the 2-year-old last week .

1503,"(CNN) -- A total of 46 inmates were injured during a prison riot at the North Fork Correctional Facility in western Oklahoma, but there were no fatalities, prison officials said Wednesday. Multiple fights had broken out in the 2,500-bed facility on Tuesday, but order was restored and the facility was completely locked down, according to a statement by Corrections Corporation of America, which runs the prison. As of Wednesday there were no reports of staff injuries, CCA said. Regarding the injuries, 16 inmates were transported to facilities outside the prison for treatment, including one who has already returned to the facility. Another 30 inmates were treated on-site by medical staff, CCA said. While the riot was taking place, a morgue was set up in a tent outside the prison, though there were no fatalities. Aerial video of the scene from CNN affiliate KOCO showed armed officials holding prisoners at gunpoint. The prison is located in Sayre, about halfway between Oklahoma City and Amarillo, Texas.

1504,"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- As the death toll climbed Monday from flooding in Southeast Asia, officials beefed up flood prevention measures to protect Thailand's capital from rising water. Millions have been affected by the flooding in Thailand and Cambodia, which has been hit by an above-average monsoonal rainy season. As of Monday, 269 people were dead in Thailand and four were missing, according to the country's Flood Relief Operations Command. Another 207 people were dead in Cambodia, according to the country's state-run news agency AKP. Patients in two hospitals in Thailand's Ayutthaya and Nakhon Sawan provinces had to be evacuated after water reached the first floor, the flood operations command said. Multiple tropical systems have moved over the area in recent weeks, enhancing monsoon rains and leading to the flooding. Another low pressure system is forecast to move into Southeast Asia on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Brandon Miller, senior meteorologist for CNN International. On Monday, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered canal dredging and reinforcement of flood-prevention embankments to protect Bangkok, state-run news agency MCOT reported. In addition, three new flood-prevention walls were being built at two locations in Rangsit, in northern Bangkok, and in Taling Chan, in the western part of the city. The government needs another 1.5 million sandbags, MCOT reported. The prime minister called on the private sector to supply them, but said the government will buy all the needed sandbags by Wednesday, the news agency said. The Rojana Industrial Park has halted operations for the time being, director Amara Charoengitwattanagun told MCOT, and the facility may be further damaged if the flooding worsens. One plant in the park, Single Point Parts, evacuated all workers from the premises and built flood prevention embankments around its building, according to MCOT. Meanwhile, Honda Thailand said on its website Monday that its plants in the Rojana park are flooded and will be closed until at least until the end of the week.","Nearly 500 people are dead in Thailand and Cambodia .

1505,"(CNN) -- IndyCar said it has launched an investigation into the 15-vehicle wreck that claimed the life of driver Dan Wheldon and expects to have preliminary findings within weeks. The organization said Wednesday individual members of various motorsports bodies will help it determine factors involved in the fiery incident Sunday at the Las Vegas Indy 300. IndyCar said it had incorrectly stated Tuesday that the Automobile Competition Committee of the United States (ACCUS) and the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the national and international governing organizations, were formally involved in the investigation. The violent crash raised fresh questions about safety, both in motor sports, generally, and at the Las Vegas track, specifically. Wheldon, a two-time Indianapolis 500 winner, had been pressing efforts to address such concerns. In an early October story posted on IndyCar.com, the racing series' official website, IndyCar Vice President Will Phillips singled out the 33-year-old driver, his team and Italian manufacturer Dallara for their efforts to fine-tune a safer car model for the 2012 season. Weeks ago, Wheldon was behind the wheel of a new prototype car for the IZOD IndyCar racing series -- one meant to make his sport safer. ""He's focused on what's been needed from him to provide for the feedback to Dallara and be consistent and concise,"" Phillips said then of Wheldon. ""You couldn't have asked for more."" Had he won Sunday's race, the Englishman with the ready smile and engaging manner would have earned a $5 million payout. Instead, he was near the back of the 34-car field when he got mixed up in a crash that featured numerous cars spinning out of control and bursting into flames, spewing smoke and debris. IndyCar on Tuesday said it was saddened by Wheldon's death. ""The safety of our drivers, their crews, IndyCar staff, racetrack staff and spectators is always our paramount concern,"" IndyCar said in a statement, declining to comment further on the probe. A public memorial service for Wheldon will be held on Sunday at the Conseco Fieldhouse in downtown Indianapolis, IndyCar said. A fund has been established to help provide for his family. Wheldon was survived by his wife, Susie, and two young sons. Two drivers seriously injured in the wreck -- J.R. Hildebrand and Pippa Mann -- were released Monday from the University Medical Center in Las Vegas, said IndyCar. Wheldon's death was the first for the IndyCar circuit since March 2006, when driver Paul Dana was killed in a two-car crash while warming up for the season-opening race at Homestead-Miami Speedway. One of the most famous racing deaths was that of the elder Dale Earnhardt in NASCAR's 2001 Daytona 500. Sports Illustrated senior writer Jon Wertheim said Monday that the sheer speed of race cars, and the minimal distance separating them, means danger lurks around every turn and on every straightaway. Wheldon, for example, was bunched with several other vehicles cruising at about 220 mph when Sunday's crash occurred. ""The fact of the matter is, you're dealing with very, very fast automobiles. They're not heavy cars,"" Wertheim said. ""There is, unfortunately, an assumption of risk when you get into one of those race cars."" Beyond questions about racing's safety generally, the condition of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway -- and whether or not it was too fast and too crammed with vehicles -- was the subject of intense questioning in the hours after Wheldon's death. Driver Dario Franchitti told ABC News that the track offered ""nowhere to get away from anybody."" ""This is not a suitable track, and we've seen it today,"" he said. The loop in Las Vegas is 1.5 miles, one mile shorter than the iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway. At the same time, it is wider than many others -- such that more cars can run alongside, and potentially collide with, one another. CNN's Greg Botelho and David Close contributed to this report.","Public memorial service for Wheldon will be held Sunday .

1506,"(CNN) -- State public health officials are contacting airline passengers after a woman with measles traveled through three airports earlier this week, a spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday. The woman traveled from an airport in Europe to Dulles International Airport in Virginia to Denver International Airport and, finally, to New Mexico's Albuquerque International Sunport, said CDC spokesman Tom Skinner. The woman, who traveled Tuesday, was diagnosed with the disease in New Mexico, he said. Health departments in each area, using information from the CDC, are contacting those who may have been exposed to the viral disease. That may include flight crews and airport workers. ""That work is ongoing,"" said Skinner, who could not confirm the airline or airlines and the originating flight's location. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said people who were working or traveling through Concourse C at the Denver airport after 9 p.m. Tuesday should monitor themselves for any early symptoms of measles, especially fever, from Monday through March 12. ""People who develop a fever should contact their health care provider or their local or state health department. People with symptoms should not go to child care, school, work or out in public, as they might have the early symptoms of measles and might be contagious,"" the department said in a statement Friday. Typically, health officials concentrate on passengers or crew who were five rows in front of or five rows behind an infected traveler, Skinner said. They are particularly mindful of small infants and children and people with underlying medical conditions. People who had not previously been immunized may have a ""small window"" after being contacted to be vaccinated or given globulins to avoid developing symptoms, Skinner told CNN. In a separate development, measles was confirmed in a 24-year-old woman who took a flight from France and two people in Boston were suspected of having the disease. Boston officials held a free measles vaccination clinic Friday. ""Most of the [U.S.] cases are imported into the country,"" Skinner said. Measles is a very contagious viral disease that is easily spread through coughing, sneezing and secretions from the mouth. Measles develops generally seven to 14 days after a person is infected, according to the CDC. A typical case of measles begins with mild to moderate fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and sore throat. Two or three days after symptoms begin, tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth. Three to five days after the start of symptoms, a red or reddish-brown rash appears. It may spread downward from the face and be accompanied by a temperature spike, the CDC says on its website.

1507,"Washington (CNN) -- In the largest alleged BP oil spill-related scam uncovered to date, federal authorities on Thursday charged two Floridians with taking $340,000 in funds intended for victims of last year's environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Justice Department officials said Joseph Harvey, 51, and Anja Kannell, 41, of Delray Beach, Florida, appeared in federal court in Miami on Thursday to face indictments for mail fraud, wire fraud and aggressive identity theft. Prosecutors said the defendants claimed the money from a $20 billion fund set up to help legitimate victims of the spill recover lost income. Justice officials said they have brought charges in at least 30 cases in which individuals tried to recover funds to which they were not entitled. This was the biggest case yet, according to the Justice Department. Harvey and Kannell are accused of filing phony claims using 34 assumed identities of actual Florida residents. These claims were complete with names and Social Security numbers, though they had fictitious addresses in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Officials say the defendants instructed that all the funds be sent to an account they controlled in Texas. A magistrate judge on Thursday ordered Harvey and Kannell to remain in custody, pending further court proceedings next week. The charges carry 10-, 15- and 20-year prison sentences upon conviction.","Joseph Harvey, 51, and Anja Kannell, 41, appear in federal court .

1508,"(CNN) -- One woman was killed and two others injured Saturday after a U-Haul van crashed into them outside Yale University's football stadium before the game against Harvard, authorities said. The driver of the van lost control of the vehicle as he was pulling into Lot D of Yale Bowl's main parking area and the vehicle suddenly accelerated, striking the women and then crashing into other vehicles, said New Haven Police spokesman Dave Hartman. The incident happened an hour and 45 minutes after the parking lot opened for tailgating at about 8 a.m., police said. No charges had been filed by late Saturday. ""You could see the path of destruction coming in,"" eyewitness Bill McNeff told CNN New Haven affiliate WTNH. Video footage showed overturned chairs and other items. One woman was pronounced dead at Yale-New Haven Hospital, where one of the other women is in serious but stable condition, Hartman said. The third woman was taken to another hospital to be treated for minor injuries, police said. In a statement, Yale said the deceased woman was not one of its students and was not believed to be affiliated with Harvard. The woman in stable condition does attend Yale. The university said it would perform a full review of policies relating to tailgating before athletics events. ""Yale extends our sympathies and prayers to the family of the woman who was killed and hopes for the speedy recovery of the two women hurt,"" the university said. ""Our thoughts are also with those who witnessed or were affected by this tragic accident."" The game, which Harvard won, kicked off at noon in New Haven, Connecticut. It was the 128th game of the rivalry. A moment of silence was held at the beginning of half time, according to the Yale Daily News, the college newspaper. The driver of the U-Haul van was speaking with New Haven Police investigators, and the cause of the accident was still under investigation, Hartman said. CNN's Dave Alsup, Zohreen Adamjee, Phil Gast and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Moment of silence is observed during half-time of rivalry game .

1509,"(CNN) -- The tragic death of English driver Dan Wheldon after a horror race crash in the U.S. should lead to changes in the IndyCar division, according to Formula One legend Jackie Stewart. Two-time Indy 500 winner Wheldon lost his life on Sunday after a multi-car collision on the 11th lap of the 2011 IndyCar World Championship's final race at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Stewart, who won Rookie of the Year at the 1966 Indy 500 before becoming a three-time F1 champion, told CNN that such a tragedy will prompt the sport to re-evaluate the current safety measures. ""Unfortunately, when accidents occur, it's then that the more creative minds get moving on changing things,"" said the 72-year-old, who successfully campaigned for better safety precautions during his career. ""Some of them may be simple to change, some of them may be more complicated, but surely change occurs. Wheldon's death a watershed moment for IndyCar? ""A lot of people will be thinking, 'What are we going to have to do to avoid the Dan Wheldon accident?' ""Is the track big enough to accommodate 34 racing cars? Is the track too fast to have 34 racing cars within a mile-and-a-half racing circuit? Will that change?"" Stewart also questioned the wisdom of mixing drivers with varying levels of IndyCar experience in such a high-speed environment. ""Will the caliber of driver be high enough to be able to control those cars at those kinds of speeds? In yesterday's race there were a good many drivers in there who were not regulars and were not fulltime IndyCar drivers. I think that's a consideration that has to be looked at."" Motorsport reacts to Wheldon tragedy . During Stewart's eight years in F1 racing for the BRM and Tyrrell teams from 1965-73, the Scot witnessed 11 driver deaths. But the elite motorsport's last casualty was in 1994 when the legendary Brazilian Ayrton Senna crashed at the San Marino Grand Prix, while IndyCar has seen four deaths in the last 15 years. ""In the period that I was racing, there was a two out of three chance you were going to die if you lived for five years, and only one out of three you were going to live. In those days, motor racing truly was dangerous,"" Stewart said. ""In these last years it's been incredibly safe by comparison ... but that doesn't mean to say it's safe when you're traveling at speeds of more than 200 miles per hour."" Stewart said governing bodies cannot do enough to protect racers. ""If you're in motorsport, whether you're an administrator, a track owner, a governing body, a racing driver or a team owner, you've got to be thinking about safety. There are always improvements able to be made,"" he said. ""Modern technology, modern materials, it is available. It's just a question of being able to think out of the box and have preventative medicine rather than just corrective medicine.""","Jackie Stewart tells CNN that Dan Wheldon's death should prompt change .

1510,"(CNN) -- All federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico closed to fishing because of last year's oil spill have reopened, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday, one day before the one-year anniversary of the disaster. The announcement came as the administration reopened the final 1,041 square miles of waters immediately surrounding the Deepwater Horizon wellhead, just east of Louisiana. No oil or sheen has been found in the area since August 4, NOAA said in a statement. NOAA sampled the area in November, March and April for potentially affected fin fish, including tuna, swordfish and escolar. The analysis of samples found ""no detectable oil or dispersant odors or flavors, and results of chemical analysis for oil-related compounds and dispersants well below the levels of concern,"" the statement said. The decision to reopen the waters was made after consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ""Throughout this process, public health and safety has been our primary goal,"" said FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg. ""This has been an extraordinary team effort and the reopening of these federal waters serves as a dramatic example of what cooperation between federal agencies can accomplish."" The April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon led to the worst oil spill in U.S. history, with more than 200 million gallons of oil released into the Gulf. At its peak in June, 37 percent of Gulf waters, or 88,522 square miles, were closed to fishing. Also Tuesday, Omega Protein Corp. announced the final settlement of its claims for costs and damages incurred as a result of the spill.
